that would make it more challenging and more like learning a language in the real world.,0
streamlined interface.,0
adjective features.,0
i'm also ambivalent that one can get perfect scores with very floppy studying.,0
they're more option online which is convenient if you have the time.,0
"i am using it for japanese and i have only found one translation errors ""excuse me, i am an apple.""",0
unless that's a popular saying in japan?,0
other then that i work on it two hours a day and repeat a lot of the lessons and i think it's great of˜Š,0
domingo is a great pp to learn languages but it is not complete so you don't find every language you are looking for.,0
otherwise it is really great and if didn't have these issues i would give a five star.,0
i pay and subscribe so that tells you quite a lot.,0
"...... please bring back those features""",0
i dislike the all or nothing feeling.,0
get flexible please.,0
my internet and data both work fine.,0
and everytime i finish a lesson it changes what level i'm on.,0
i'm making no progress.,0
"update: as soon as i wrote the previous comment the pp changed to an is like environment, don't know how, i didn't download an update and i don't let the device do it on its own!",0
"so... very strange, right?",0
great pp.,0
i am learning german.,0
edit : i am having issues with my pp recently.,0
everything was good until a couple of days ago before i updated the pp to the latest version.,0
left pp alone for 13 hours thinking i would have almost 3 hearts to practice with but i only had one.,0
"i've used this pp before and it was pretty good, but i got a new phone and had to download the pp.",0
tried downloading it again and it's still not working.,0
i have the pp and the issue is not solved in the latest update.,0
my review is for the mobile version alone.,0
it is conceptual good and can teach the basis at the very least.,0
when i first started i was learning but as things got rougher i started struggling to understand why certain phrases are used and why.,0
when you're struggling to learn and it shows you're competing against other people you dont know and you drop 10-15 places it kills the moral of learning .,0
the pp just wasn't what i was hoping for.,0
"when i growled a way to speak to a fellow japanese student, the answer presented by domingo was ""you can, however, click on someone's name/icon to go to their profile (or ""stream"" as domingo calls it) and post a message to them there.""",0
this statement is false.,0
this makes me disappointed in learning foreign language.,0
so far so good with the learning.,0
i understand that the free version will serve me as and i'm quite happy to see them.,0
product search history from shopping apes).,0
that is super creep.,0
which makes it awful!,0
i wish u guns could fix it!,0
i only figure it out by elimination.,0
"after introducing ""refreshing"" courses, i find that most of my limited time i spend on the pp is used retreating the same categories over and over, plateauing my progress.",0
"not bad, but i prefer to use a computer.",0
mainly because i cannot see my assignment to gage how much i have left to do for my weekly german homework.,0
this pp was absolutely amazing when i first started it.,0
"i'm the type of person to need those extra lessons because without them, i won't know when i should move on and i get lost.",0
"it discouraged me so much, and i haven't touched the pp in weeks.",0
i'm seriously hoping they change it back.,0
i love this pp.,0
i'm using the pp to learn japanese and irish.,0
i couldn't understand the grammar rules for irish.,0
thankful someone in the comments posted it.,0
that's really disappointing.,0
love the pp because it's easy to use in my busy life.,0
"i like this pp however, i don't know if it was helpful at teaching me basis like numbers and how to conjugal a verb.",0
i can access them on the webster version of domingo.,0
it would be very nice to add them on the pp swell.,0
it makes it very hard to study without them.,0
"for a free platform, it's not bad.",0
i was using the pp both on is and andros an i have to say that being punished for my mistakes in the is pp made me uncomfortable all the time.,0
now i'm really thinking to delete the pp!,0
could you pus tell me what are your intentions with this health/hearts system?,0
"after that you either can complete practice rounds to regain ""health"" or buy them with points.",0
very annoying.,0
"also, most aspects of the language grammar are not explained.",0
this pp is easy to use and helps with memorization.,0
and you can turn off the speaking and listening features.,0
"this makes failure impossible to avoid when you are supposed to translate what you hear, and you can't even hear anything.",0
this makes you fail lessons and interrupt the otherwise enjoyable learning experience in an annoying way.,0
a 5 star pp without this issue.,0
this pp has bags that do not allow you to click on the correct response.,0
it has happened to me more than a dozen times and i've reported it each time.,0
"for months, these errors have not been fixed.",0
"because of this, you cannot finish a lesson, or level, and must abort the whole thing.",0
this happens primarily on the more complex lessons.,0
most of the pp is just fine.,0
i tried it seems many people love this pp.,0
maybe it's just me,0
"and when i've blown a lesson, i'd hope to get medial on that topic, rather than being quitted on basic vocal; after 75 days and over 75 hours i can generally get cat, dog and monkey correct, but i never really get irregular verbs.",0
"i may try again sometime, by which time it will be from the very beginning, but while i'd love to learn more i can't devote multi hours daily.",0
overall it's very hit or miss.,0
yeah it's money gray with it's price subscriptions yeah it's got false promises and yeah they ask for or money before u even start learning a language...but u are learning a language for free.,0
you will at least remember something.,0
please return the sound of™,0
me.,0
what vocabulary is there is not incredibly useful.,0
"i would buy this if i were convinced the lessons contained actual instruction, but i am not convinced they do.",0
"i am having trouble with letters 3. it has a hiccup and will not acknowledge ""t"" answer even though there are no other option on the watching of letter and symbol.",0
i can't go any further with the program.,0
for days it gets to that and stops.,0
is there a programming problem.,0
i used domingo for hind before and the problem did not exist.,0
help!,0
i'm learning organ and refreshing my french.,0
"however, organ is not so.",0
i have to use outside sources to learn about the words.,0
the lessons don't make sense and there has been zero explanation of honorifics and choosing between different translation option is impossible without outside help.,0
it's been very frustration.,0
it's pretty good for a starting point.,0
there are two major shortcomings though.,0
(war lumen has 3 meanings depending on context).,0
for example with german i heard (line) very clearly even when using slow talk.,0
it wanted miner,0
the pp is just horrible.,0
"if you loose all your lives, and you don't finish any lessons, that's it, your streak is done for, and you can't practice!",0
i have been using domingo from the past 250 days.,0
everyone has a different capability to grasp.,0
!,0
pp works well and lots of option.,0
"while i appreciate this to ensure retention it seems this should either take into account lesson goals per day, be optional or like lesson goals have a control for decay rate.",0
this pp would be rate higher by me but this feature greatly diminishes my learning potential based on my time.,0
why??,0
"you're trying to bribe me to buy ""health points""?????",0
for the last 2 days you say i have 399 health points instead of the 450 needed to get stuck because got the last question of the lesson wrong????,0
really????,0
this happened 3 times.,0
whatever.....,0
sometimes it says i am not saying something right when i know i am.,0
"like ""sin sal"".",0
"this is the rd pp i've tried and so far, by far the easiest to maneuver.",0
thanks,0
hello!,0
i really like the pp and use it really frequently but i only have one issue after the make.,0
the pp would have 5/of˜† for me otherwise,0
good pp.,0
i've enjoyed using this pp the past few weeks but i'm finding all the tying to be a real pity.,0
i seriously doubt i'm going to last.,0
if you want to spell spanish words and type all the time this would be a 5 star pp.,0
updated dec 21 the repetition type on my phone is getting older by the minute.,0
get this only to support learning another language,0
i think it's rude.,0
if you're attempting to learn a new language you're going to make mistakes and lose hearts.,0
if you run out of hearts and can get more the progress is lost for that lesson and can start the lesson without hearts to get better at the language.,0
pretty back.,0
please!!,0
"there is no additional into, only tasks!",0
"so it's just words memorization, not learning... nonsense (( (the french lessons are great!)",0
could i get my gems back please?,0
"so can you please fix that pitch so we can keep our gems if we don't do the test, and also can i get my gems back as well please!",0
"otherwise, i love the pp!",0
i installed hoping to solve these problems but still lost all my gems.,0
the reviews prove this.,0
are the developer even listening?,0
"anyhow, i have to take my tablet out of the keyboard case in order to type.",0
can this be fixed?,0
it works if i go online.,0
"this pp continually tells me my answer is incorrect when it matches exactly with what the ""correct"" answer is.",0
"when i went to the site, i saw hundreds of the same complaints.",0
hundreds.,0
frustration!,0
"overall i like the format, especially that it gets into verbs right away.",0
"if that part worked, i'd give it 5 stars.",0
"if they just took out the hearts or gave us more every day, this pp would have 5 stars.",0
i find the explanations for usage if parts of speech helpful.,0
how would i even know the differences if it isn't pointed out?,0
"if those important things are explained, i would give 5 stars",0
huge downgrade over the years.,0
gutted as my brother learnt arabic with it before the heart system was introduced.,0
"this would be 5 stars but there is a consistent issue where experience points ate not being applied when unlocking levels, the double experience point feature in the shop does not work some of the time as well.",0
the old version was better.,0
it's an easy pp to use.,0
"after every lesson it shoves an add in your face and after that it asks you to buy domingo, premium?",0
double check what you are paying for or get unpleasant surprise charges!,0
it's so good!,0
"so, 3 stars",0
it's not a bad language learning pp.,0
"besides, what person with a full - time job has time for more than a few lessons a day?",0
i really like the domingo method.,0
unfortunately the pp stopped working and i had to reinstate it.,0
this erased all my progress and i had to take the placement test again.,0
a wonderful learning tool.,0
one of the best and most useful pp for me.,0
the first few levels were cool.,0
i am enjoying using this pp.,0
"so, its slowing my progress.",0
"my girlfriend has hearts in hers and it's a clear cash grab, very disappointed in this pp.",0
"ok, one problem.",0
i recently completed my st checkpoint on my spanish class on domingo.,0
is: and my double gem wager.,0
"sayounara, ladies.",0
it s a system need improving however it's very enjoyable and fun to learn with.,0
encouraging and inspiring,0
the pp is clung.,0
if you're rolling through the lessons then they show up in the order they are supposed to.,0
this is a great pp!,0
"for example, under the chinese symbol for eat, put ch«.",0
"if i am missing that, i'm sorry.",0
great pp overall!,0
samson galaxy s.,0
that only seems logical.,0
so far so good.,0
great way to learn a language without going to a class.,0
the pp is very helpful.,0
however there are stitches i.e.,0
that's major frustration because its a major part of learning,0
very buggy.,0
worth getting though.,0
i hope they will change that.,0
good and exciting when needed,0
sometimes the learner needs to go back and review his/her items.,0
it really can help.,0
also when they do one syllable at a time it is off.,0
its a great pp and is very useful and helps with my pronunciation but it would have been better if you didn have to pay for other lessons xx,0
"it's ok, but some free apes are better",0
not a bad pp but they where trying to make it like netflix getting that money all the time.,0
make sure to cancel subscription otherwise till keep filling you forever.,0
its a nice pp but only lets you go so far for free.,0
so far it has been a very good pp and i can see it would help me with beginner's french if it wasn't for the fact it costs so much!,0
such a shame,0
ok pp.,0
up to know no problem but it will be hard to member,0
help me.,0
it's so so right now.,0
i'll be back later with an update,0
sure wish it would stop assuming me to rate it when i have multiple times,0
so far so good.,0
will be in a better position to rate better after using the pp for some time,0
i did not like it only because it would start me off with spanish but i have never read or learned spanish before.,0
i feel like it doesn't give you a more understanding of connect words.,0
like (es=is) & (so= i am).,0
wish i could patch on my course i paid for all those so many years ago so i don't have to start at the the lui mania beginning.,0
this program very beautiful i wish more developed for the program,0
its good but it moves at a very slow pace.,1
it's not challenging enough.,1
it keeps enforcing basic vocabulary using baby sentences while occasionally adding new words.,1
"it's also clot of multiple choice which helps you choose the right answer by eliminating the obvious wrong answers, which makes it too easy and doesn help me learn.",1
they need less multiple choice and more speaking without words on screen.,1
"others, like organ, seem to have been designed by a teenager only interested in talking about boy bands/ girl bands... seriously, skin all logical vocabulary and into sentences and go straight into ""that singer is not cool. """,1
please design organ so it makes sense.,1
"i'm disappointed that we must learn the sounds of characters before their meanings, which often inspire their shape.",1
i wish they added a voice recognition to practice saying the words/symbols/ and sentences.,1
"also the listening exercises don't work after the last update and i don't hear anything, please fix this problem.",1
"however, after an (old) update, provided comments, but received no response from developer, i am a little disappointed with their customer engagement.",1
"... ... old comment : ""i can no longer see how many words i've learnt this month, (and the previous month's either) also, where are the little graph of progress etc ""what were you thinking""?",1
"it would be more, realistic if they allowed month to month membership.",1
"it irs me that the as claim to be to help everyone learn for free, yet they don't have a pay plan for those of us who are on fixed incomes, and are striving to change that.",1
newsflash domingo... not everyone who uses this pp is so wealthy they can afford to give you a year up front...& not everyone who uses this pp is so dirt poor that free is the only answer.,1
it keeps putting me in office mode.,1
i got to level four and then it took me back to level three so i finished a part of level three and it rest me back to the beginning of level three again?,1
"i would give you 5 stars but the environment you designed for is is better that the one for andros, if you improve the andros one maybe, maybe i would give you the 5 stars and pay the plus subscription.",1
now i am taking down another star because the speaking exercises are annoying.,1
my internet connection is perfectly fine yet it's failing to connect to the internet.,1
the hearts (that you use to practice) don't continue to charge unless you open the pp again.,1
clicked the hearts to see the time... started counting down 5 hours.. please fix the refill period of the hearts.,1
i kept trying to log back in using my email but it kept saying there was an error.,1
i will give it 3 stars because i learned basis of german just in 2 days but now the sounds in the listening exercises aren't coming so i have to skin it moreover earlier when i pressed any word it used to pronounce it for me which helped a lot but it has stopped i don't know why it happened but ply help me i really like this pp .,1
"the audit in listening exercises is not working, also when selecting an answer it doesn read it, while the sound when u answer correctly can be heard.",1
so many duplicate answers while learning japanese while only one of them is good.,1
makes it impossible to go through many lessons as you are faced with 1/2 chances of looking a heart everytime you come by such questions.,1
"however, it falls short on several points: 1. the tips doesn't cover what is in the skill.",1
"furthermore, the tips aren't show at the beginning.",1
"to fix this, it is suggested to give the tips at the first level and lesson of each skill.",1
the bell button should be for reviews.,1
"2. the league leaderboard may not be synchronised, i had more up gained in that day but others are ranged higher.",1
please add the ability to use the keyboard to do the exercises.,1
"forcing me to use word banks means i don't learn anything, and subsequently, repeatedly install the pp and use the desktop version instead.",1
then i'd use all my stars trying to figure things out i'd get discouraged finally i just quit playing.,1
if this pp had some short tutoring video it would help.,1
this pp would have been awarded 5 stars had it given the learner a way to connect and communicate with other earners more efficiently.,1
please provide gratification to those of us wanting to communicate.,1
this pp is very good and i really enjoy it but i dont know why i have no audit and can hear anything.,1
"ok so this pp is really nice and i like that it reaches you stuff for free, but ever since they put that ""you only have 5 hearts"" thing it's not enjoyable anymore, i'm learning russian and it's really hard for me to make no mistakes i would rate full stars but the heart thing is ridiculous, oh and you have to wait hours to get your hearts back, but besides all of that, it's really helpful would recommend",1
what i don't like is how the pp is clearly accepting data from other apes on my phone to serve me as (e.g.,1
"additional, the pp frequently rests during a lesson and you lose all your work and have to start the lesson over.",1
i truly like this pp.. but i dont know but has happened that i can listen to the andros!,1
"i have a problem with this pp, recently i have audit problems in pp it doesn work for many lessons.",1
"also after the latest update there are new problems, solve them please",1
"for japanese, domingo needs work.",1
"sometimes i get anti i've never seen before, not spelled out.",1
"lastly, for japanese, social context is important.",1
"it reaches that ""domo"" is an acceptable way to say thanks, but it's only for informal cases, and would be considered rude if used casually",1
i hope they implement an assignment tax soon.,1
the update where you only need 5 lessons to get to the next level has seriously missed up the whole experience.,1
i wish it didn't drain my battery so fast.,1
"edit (11/7): i just learned that the grammar tips and whatnot are only available on the web version, save for the few languages the added to in the last update.",1
"my biggest issue (i'm learning spanish) is often you are asked to type what you hear, i've ran into the problem where the pp says ""un"" but it is supposed to be ""un"" and i get dined for it.",1
the only thing that bags me for a while is that i cannot access the lecture notes in the pp itself.,1
dark mode would be much appreciated swell.,1
white on white makes me blind after a while...,1
"but, the phrases used (spanish) to teach the language are weird, and sometimes just unnatural.",1
"also, don't like the leagues, it makes it more about racking up points instead of learning the language.",1
"i'm a big fan of do, but (re)introducing the health system in the pp makes me totally disappointed (and the pp unable, mio).",1
so i learned using the andros pp but today the hearts appeared in the andros version also.,1
the free version of this pp now gives you a limit of 5 mistakes.,1
"but, there is a constant bug causing the sound files to not load properly, resulting in silent lessons that punish you for not being able to hear the language.",1
"the snug, patronizing, unskippable ""here's a tip"" screens make me want to throw my phone out of the window.",1
"some courses are good, like japanese and chinese, while some others are horrible, like organ.",1
this is the best pp but for some reason after the updated the sound doesn't work.,1
it is also quite limited and overlay repetition.,1
there is little to no actual instruction on grammatical rules so you kind of have to guess and hope for the best.,1
"if i was only doing french i would give the pp 4 or 5 stars, but the organ course is lacking.",1
the early lessons can sometimes use sentences so simple that it's impossible to drive the intended meaning.,1
the second and most irritating issue is the quality of the audit.,1
it's hard to hear exactly what is being said often due to how muddy the audit is.,1
this is a learning tool not a game.,1
there shouldn't be lives!,1
"it's not even like the lives charge quickly, no, it takes 5 hours!",1
"so i highly recommend the brother, but don't use the pp.",1
but now i lost interest in it because of it's new feature that allows you to go to the next checkpoint only when you have completed all the 4 levels of each chapter in the previous checkpoint.,1
this is very annoying because sometimes i dont feel like repeating all the levels of the chapter because i feel i have learnt it enough and it was easier.,1
give flexibility to the user to move ahead!,1
disappointed that it's more like a game than lessons.,1
hard to keep going if you make mistakes and run out of life and have to wait for more energy.,1
"however after a couple of weeks the pp stopped working, not warding health or points.of¤¨",1
one new feature that is more annoying is the breaking of previously completed skill at a rate that at my current learning goal results in only 1 new lesson every 2 days.,1
"so very tired of ""no health left"" penalty that locks the pp when you get answer wrong.",1
i listen to your as as faithfully to support you but you lock me out constantly.,1
it would be 5 stars if the voice recognition worked.,1
then it uses all my hearts and i can practice until the hearts restore in a day.,1
they need to make it so you dont lose a heart if they can get the voice recognition to work properly.,1
"good for beginners, not great for if you are trying to perfect a language you already know.",1
you can no longer see the up under or next to each language which really helped me see which one i should practice first or more.,1
please please please add the up where you pick your languages.,1
"i just dont like the whole heart point thing, it really limits the whole learning process.",1
"so the more incorrect answers you give, the less you can learn.",1
"you should learn from your mistakes, not be punished for them...",1
it's ok.. i can afford the paid option so its a little annoying when my hearts /lives disappear into thin air which happens regularly,1
give come on today and only have 3 when i haven even done anything!,1
"this is a pitch that needs sorting... not everyone can pay out for games, and i dont have an issue with as.",1
great pp with poor hints and pronunciation.,1
"i love that it says learn for free, but you get about 5-10 minutes a day that's free",1
"great learning pp, but i hate that you lose an entire lesson when you're heart health runs out because of mistakes.",1
it makes any lesson you get wrong even longer because you have to repeat it and it hurts you from getting points to be in the leader board.,1
its advertised as free yet isn free because you run out of gems to buy hearts.,1
"reducing to three starts, because: - the latest update has missed with my progress!",1
"i had 5/15 done for many sections on level 4, but now they are complete; - for a few days domingo appears to drain my phone's battery like hell!",1
"it constantly appears in the list of apes that used the battery for the past n minutes, and the battery discharges two times faster than before.",1
improve the organ lessons.,1
"i started a test and then it said ""an error occurred"" and i didn't get my 5 gems back... and that's the th time now.",1
fun but itchy.,1
"lost gems when i buy more hearts (does not replenished hearts, only takes gems), not gaining hearts at the given time frame.",1
i have to close and re open pp between levels or it clashes.,1
too many push modifications.,1
no obvious way to contact customer service in free version.,1
there have been so many changes and they are not all good.,1
the pp will not work in landscape mode on a tablet.,1
"but -- even though i have the microphone permission on, the pp won't let me do the recorded spoken exercises.",1
its system of hearts discourages making mistakes when in reality everyone makes mistakes.,1
"it is a good incentive to learn but at the same time, you often run out of hearts and can't resume learning a language.",1
would have given it a five if you wouldn have added the health aspect into it i think that is a huge drawback to this pp i understand the benefits of the concept but you are already practicing as you go so why limit how much you can learn in a day by having to have health it makes no sense just makes it harder to go forward,1
"domingo plus offers progress quires, but the content is dominated by vocabulary and grammar that hasn't been introduced.",1
"also, there is not enough emphasis on spelling and speaking new words and phrases.",1
it's good for the method of teaching but it lacks in explaining masculine/feminine and why a word is pluralized or singular.,1
for example the word in the sentence is singular but the french word is plural.,1
"now this pp is riddle with painless modifications and as, gamificafion knob cracked to 11. i get you want to make money but this is still mostly volunteer work.",1
would be an amazing pp but it takes too long to restore hearts so i'm getting nowhere.,1
it says free trial but i click it and it wants me to pay for the year!,1
my biggest grip with this pp is the voice portion when learning vietnamese.,1
"the pronunciation are too quick, and you don't get a chance to hear it well enough.",1
"i think you should remove the latest updated when it comes to wait for 3 or 4 hours just to get an heart so you can practice, but anyway it is a good pp and helpful one",1
but the heart part of it is annoying.,1
"pp is good, but be aware that the paid version is a 60$ a year subscription, -not- a pay 10$ once to clock the no as version.",1
but the health thing is annoying.,1
and the as taking up to 30 seconds to finish is also annoying.,1
however i find that it relief too much on phrase learning and should not be a replacement for actual education in the language.,1
"the pp would get 6 stars if not for their new ""leagues.""",1
"for those of us actually interested in learning, competing with people that are earning thousands of points a day is counterproductive.",1
"nice pp anything free is going to be selling , unfortunately every time i get 1 wrong i am locked out for hours as i have no "" hearts "" i cannot afford to buy hearts but would like more of a chance to evolve",1
oh oh after an update the forts are now too small to read on my mobile.,1
but the pp does a poor job of adjusting if the learner (me) starts to struggle.,1
"though, it is not saying the words to me, when i tap them.",1
"when i first got it there weren't even as, this is unfortunate.",1
it really helps and i love it the pp is helping me learn spanish h.c but why the neck would you add a heart system i just want to learn different languages not make a couple mistakes and wait a day just to make the same mistakes and i keep making the same mistakes because i can practice the nodding language.,1
old good pp get rid of heart is i know its for microtransactions and you guns need your money but really 5 hearts,1
"but when i try to tap the next level, it reload, fix this, for favor i don't anna lose my 6 day streak.",1
it is very good that the languages are taught for free....the only complain is that it takes clot of time to load,1
"if you back out to the main menu and then click on a lesson, the wrong lesson comes up and you have to stroll through the lessons subfolders until you find the one you are looking for.",1
the only thing i would add is the enunciation under the word.,1
i'm learning hebrew and i wish they would show the english version of what i'm learning because i have no idea what i'm really saying.,1
"the pp so far is pretty good; however it keeps crashing, has required 2 starts and it a little buggy on some of the screens.",1
"too advanced, i don't recommend for beginners",1
great pp but not consumer friendly as far as pricking and payment goes.,1
$200 is too much up front to clock all of the units and i'm unwilling to pay monthly for something i'll never own.,1
i would be much more willing to pay to clock units as i progress.,1
there 20 units for spanish and i'd lady pay $10 to clock each unit as i progress.,1
having problem putting new amazon prime purchase key into old learning pp from trial.,1
hard to navigable at times,1
the two problems that i have are not having any explanation of what grammar i am learning and no way for me to gauge how well my pronunciation is.,1
most of the time you can get the gist of what the program is trying to teach you but outside of word memorization i feel like i would get more out of having an explanation of the lesson before taking the practices,1
when you try to pronounce a word sometimes the just doesn't hear it no matter how loud you are.,1
"can you please fix the bug were it is not testing my speech, just going to the next picture.",1
i wish i didn't need a computer to have the live sessions.,1
"i can't use the total version, when i'm not home.",1
good to start basic vietnamese with lacking in learning layout should start with alphabet learning first then go onto grammar structure instead its reversed but overall it's good program,1
"great pp, but it's just too expensive.",1
but there is no back feature in this pp.,1
"there are several very annoying bags:  - periodically it starts ""continue automatically to next screen"" even when this option is turned off;  -  sometimes it does not recognize the voice;  - long loading time;  - after started shows the random lesson in the unit to learn instead of the first to be done.",1
the pp is extremely frustration when it comes to pronunciation.,1
it says the word once and then just buzzed you if you say it wrong and wants you to try again without saying it to you again to help you get it right.,1
its a good pp but i mean it gives you a monthly pay but you actually have to pay the whole price for the term its very irritating because i want to pay monthly.... due to the fact that i dont know how long it will take me to finish the course but i can and i dont want to have to pay a 6 month subscription if in donna finish in just 4 months or have to buy a 6 month and then not finish and have to buy the three month set only not to use the whole three month set,1
much better on the computer version in my opinion.,1
many of the buttons on mobile are difficult to press without his-clinking such as the play button to hear something before selecting it.,1
"2 lessons and then you have to pay to go farther, otherwise i would give it a better rating!",1
love it so far but i wish i knew exactly what i'm saying as i'm looking at the pictures.,1
it does not start with alphabet or pronunciation.,1
i just got thrown into random conversations.,1
"sadly did not have the language i was looking to learn, but i can tell it is a very helpful and immersion program to learn a new language.",1
needs improvement in voice recognition.,1
very expensive.,1
i can log in on the web via my school webster but not the pp.,1
use too much time to download of unit.,1
pretty good wish it had does with it,1
i hate that you have to pay to get the full access,1
some languages are designed well - japanese.,2
"learning chinese, i enjoy the incremental vocabulary and systematic sentences.",2
this pp works fine without having the adds removed.,2
"the more they update, it just makes it feel like some kind of game to be plowed through.",2
it's easy to pick up and work on in short bursts.,2
domingo has come a long way and is a very fun to use pp for learning.,2
in french the lessons build slowly and helpful hints.,2
"i love the brother version of domingo, and i use it all the time.",2
once i got going wasn't hard to figure out how to gain more live.,2
"good, fun learning format.",2
"i have only been using the pp for a couple days but i'm enjoying how it repeats lessons in fun and different ways, i don't like the adds on the free version but at this point i will put up with them until i decide otherwise.",2
a picture can tell many stories.,2
i do like the fact they use pictures in their lessons.,2
definitely having fun though!,2
