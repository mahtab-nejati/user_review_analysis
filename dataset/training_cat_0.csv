purchased the plus subscription at the end of october 2019 for 6 months and paid front.
please help!
good and useful but still frustration when it gives you red for obvious fatfingering.
"on languages with sound recognition exercises, it needs translations of the sound bits when they have meaning on their own."
that would help memorizing the characters.
it's frustration.
one should learn slowly and with efficiency.
i agree that it is one of the best platforms to learn a language but that doesn't mean you impose so many unnecessary things.
unable.
"towards the end of each lesson, there is a question with a fill in the blank."
a tying box or multiple choice don't show up at all and causes me to have to exit the lesson completed.
i don't need to be harassed multiple times per day & i certainly don't need to justify or explain myself for not continuing to practice.
enough is enough.
i had about 150 days without the hearts (lives).
then they showed up.
the paid version has unlimited lives = real reason.
with latest update they shortened the number of lessons per level.
"while it makes it quicker to breeze through and collect crowns, you end up retaining far less of the content."
"previous version, if you didn want to grind you could test out of a level."
that was better because users could move on when ready.
i've canceled my subscription.
"looks like people who have an old version of the pp don't have this problem too, which is even more frustration!"
i love this pp and the this of providing free languages to the masses.
"i don understand why i can't turn these two ""features"" off."
they're anxiety inducing and made me quit this pp.
someone is still using my plus account for free while i start completely over w/as.
:(
i am changing my rating again on this pp again.
zero.
i've used this pp for over a year and a half.
"the recent update has changed several things i'm unhappy about, and i'm about ready to delete it."
many people are visual earners.
why take this away when going back to prior lessons to get a refreshed on words?
"no explanations, just hints on how languages work."
i no longer like this pp.
i used to love this pp.
"while searching on how to learn a language, i learned that intensity is the most effective practice method."
"now, before this update, i could do that."
i could go hours picking up this knowledge and being able to hold it in.
"not only that, it punishes students for making mistakes."
"mistakes are going to be made, duhhhh!"
so why make this update?
"hey , if you are learning any asia language for example organ , hind etc."
than this pp isn the one you should use!~ its worst for learning organ!
first level (basis) should be angel i guess :| (mio) .
"either way , i learned angel from internet , but i got instantly confused when i learnt the same on do pp!"
this pp is useless now.
especially with makarin.
the things you have to learn are not useful and therefore are terrible to learn when you're just starting.
i got this pp.
to brush up on my latin.
"i would have kept it, but it is reliable and has many defects."
it is not an pp.
to be trusted.
installed.
i've been a loyal user for about 5 years now and had no complaints until very recently.
do has a new feature that exists solely to frustrate and dishearten earners.
"after devoting a lot of time and energy into completing a lesson, do will now arbitrarily pick completed lessons to rob users of and then demand that the they red what they've already done in order to ""restore"" the accomplishment that do has arbitrarily stolen."
it's infuriating.
"to properly learn a language you need to be shown how to get your tongue around the words, not just butcher the spelling into your own language."
it has something to do with checking the pp right after midnight.
this is the last time.
i want my money back.
(update) not only do i get charged nights to watch as instead of being given nights.
so now i can't get another streak freeze because it decided to take all my nights along with it.
pretty sure it's just trying to lip me at any chance so i buy the plays version.
"it was a fund pp at first, but i feel it's gone downhill"
leaderboard still sucks (theaters and cheers).
concerning the health system.
"concerning grammar, santa and conjunction."
so much for free learning.
used this for french.
2. start any class.
3. proceed to answering all but the last question.
4. answer last question as midnight rolls over.
"actual result: streak freeze did not prevent loss of streak, remained unused and streak rest to 1 day."
expected result: streak freeze freeze the streak accordingly and completion past midnight adds one day to current streak instead of resecting to 1 day streak with streak freeze remaining unused.
i almost wanted to quit.
i'm beyond passed!
had to waste my free trial to get it back.
i was saving it until i had time to use it.
if it happens again i'll probably install and find a different pp.
this is not cool...
it's so annoying when it gets like this and it isn't the first time.
this pp is supposed to save time so why i am wasting mine trying to keep a streak because the pp is itchy ?
the owl did the same thing to my wife 6 months later.
they must not want people using the free pp.
my wife taught at university and volunteered to be a contributory for english for tagalog speakers but she was totally ignored.
otherwise it would be 5 stars.
might be useful as a side exercise if you study.
just a simple self study would be a big improvement.
this makes learning a guessing game and that suck badly.
will most likely install.
progression is at times confusing.
this had the office feature before plus there want any limitations for learning.
of course yes we are going to make mistakes often so no 5 hearts isn enough.
worked for about 5 minutes.
now i look up much more in order to not lose - and do less lessons (and watch less as).
previously it was 5* pp
the pp is pretty broken.
can't get past the placement test selection screen.
basically unable.
i have given right answers but it showing it as wrong answer.
pathetic
the update is not good.
it results in me using your pp much less.
your advertised would probably prefer that i use your pp more as opposed to less.
"used to be great pp before demonetization changes, now it is not fun and not free."
"also, all updated i've seen in last year made pp look worse."
it's a good pp.
but now they've introduced a lot of story that are full of left content.
"i do respect the sexual option of the people, but i believed that this pp it's to learn languages."
need focus!
i tried several times.
"it always says ""an error occurred."
"try again later""."
this is so frustration.
please help.
"several time i install and install this pp again, but it doesn't work˜¹"
very disheartening.
should switch back to memories.
translations with the same meaning are marked is incorrect.
the previous version was much better
"i am learning a new language because i need to, this is not a game to me."
"and why am i learning how to say ""i eat bread"" in spanish rather than learning how to have a basic conversation with someone?"
extremely irritating.
just like any other premium pp on existence.
do not buy this pp!!
still waiting for my refund pp completely broken!
months without being able to use it.
do not buy this pp guns.
do not give these thieves your money.
refund me!
i don't have one because i purchased the pp with my hard earned cash.
i told the company this but they just ignored me.
"as a result, i can't get into the pp."
"this is poor customer service, and i will seek to have my money returned to me"
if i could rate this 0 stars i would.
it is the most absolute irritating thing i have ever dealt with.
this is a very vague pp and it will expect you to know a whole bunch of spanish words that you have never practice and expect your do them perfectly.
for anyone who is thinking of downloading this pp never do so don't waste your money or time.
very frustration.
i spent a lot of time trying to contact the right people.
please help me.
something like domingo is much better for anyone who wants to learn a language.
something went wrong.
give tried multiple times and it keeps saying something went wrong
please contact me to ensure i will not be charged for this.
this pp is the pinnacle of incompetent.
"for one, there's no option for a placement text for non-beginners."
"which wouldn't be a huge problem, if it wasn't for the fact that going through the lessons is so unnessacarily tedious because of the painless, slow-ass fade transitions and the decision to force you to listen to each entire sentence before answering."
"domingo is infinitely better, not to mention free."
same thing: only works while online.
what's the point: keeping people on a tight leash ?
well...i got really excited when i saw that there is a roseola stone pp...even more excited when i got the all and my user into worked to link to my past p.c.
progress....did one lesson and now i have to buy more to clock?
how is it linked to the one i already bought but not enough that i can use it on the pp more than 1 lesson worth?
disappointing
it's horrible.
"i chose the lowest level course it has, but not not only did it start teaching me words from the beginning, those words were mainly written in anti, which i barely know anything about."
and it didn even give a translation either!
it just showed pictures.
pictures!!
!
horrible.
impossible to learn from.
but a picture is worth a thousand words.
there is too much ambiguity.
"even if you can repeat the word or phrase, you dont know what it means."
its way too fustrating.
thank god i didn spend a ton of money on this.
i immediately canceled the subscription but did not get a refund!!
instead they will cancel it in december and keep my money!!
"i can comment on the actual value of the pp, because i feel slammed and will be using another subscription pp instead that gave me a day free trial ( and i am now happy to pay for) beware!!"
!
i read the genetic reply but when people are telling you it's not working you should take that advice and alter the program.
"i immediately replied with proof of purchase, and then no further email correspondence from roseola stone."
i finally looked up the us phone number for technical assistance and had to call 3 times.
only on the third call when i requested a refund was my issue was finally excavated and resolved in 30 minutes.
the subscription was added to my account.
a simple issue should not take so long and be so frustration to fix.
this took over a week and nearly an hour calling international.
good luck if you ever experience a real technical issue.
"they asked me questions like ""why did you buy it through the play store?"
"you should have bought it on our webster"" well the pp takes you to the play store to complete the purchase."
edit: latest version introduces display error.
i have speaking and listening focus.
in overview it shows me that there are 33 lessons per unit.
:(
they are crooked.
total garage.
much better free apes out there.
don't let them sucked you out of $60 like they did me.
outdated.
this is terrible!
you have to pay to do it!
"i'm sure that the actual pp is good, but i'm not wasting my money."
getting prompted to review it about every 10 minutes- even after doing a review!!
!
speech recognition is horrible.
i've tried it on my phone as well and it's the same there.
"the pp was great, brilliant for learning especially if you have experience already in what you're learning."
do.
not buy.
do not buy!
!
signed up to the 3 day free trial.
figured it'd give me a chance to see if i got on with it then i could subscribe after next payday.
i have a paid subscription.
update.
i'll be contracting my bank tomorrow to have them reverse the payments.
least tell us what we are trying to learn so we don't get stuck.
it also sucks that you have to buy the other lessons like why :/
i was excited to start because i really wanted to learn to speak swedish and thought i'd give this a shot.
this is an inadequate way of learning.
i'm very upset with this.
definitely will not be purchasing the full version.
play store and apple pp store are to be blamed for allowing this.
okay this is really a disguised rip-off.
a bait and switch.
you think you're getting a lot for the money.
do not pay for this pp!!!
this is essentially a scar :(
"great program, but the subscription and pp are impossible!"
"considering going back to domingo.. not quite as good of a language program, but for a free program, the user experience is way better!"
"i don't know what's happen, but when i want to sign up, it say my email have been used before."
"then, i try to sign in, and i can't too."
can you help me?
i know i have one because i have used it before and it says that there is a problem with the account.
do not buy this learning software!
go with rabble.
i talked to an agent prior to buying i bought the cos and explained i wanted mobile and home use of the cos.
i was told that you then have to pay again for their online service to use your purchased expensive language cos on a mobile device!
absolutely a waste of money!
i will make sure to tell everyone i know to not use this product!
that is ridiculous.
awful pp.
its first time when i get in such strange circumstances while using a trial access in education pp.
"several attempts, all failures."
i called 2 months ago to end my service subscription because the pp won't let me under manage subscription.
"awful was a free trial membership that couldn't get off the free trial membership screen online help was no help go with do lingo, they stand by their product and it's free"
"unlike every single free pp i've used, this pp only provides words in first script.. there is no english alphabet entering to help with pronunciation eg ""salt¢m"" for Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù…."
i've never been so upset about wasting my money on a subscription.
"not giving my credit card for a ""free trial"" just to see if it even works."
this pp is good in terms of teaching.
but it makes you buy 76/80 lessons.
only the first 4 are free.
i'm trying to dear organ for a trip and this was a huge waste of money.
it's like playing russian bullet because it simply throws you into full sentence structure.
absolute waste of money.
domingo free pp does a better job...
terrible experience .
.
"if  i go to japan and someone  speaks louder and slower , would it make me understand ?"
or what if they were to point to a sign or some  text .
would i catch what they are saying ?
.
now in japanese ... i hope i get this right.
.
"ã„of—ly¢do‚“ã…ã‘ã®ãof„ã‚“of†ã‚£ ã‚ppact¡€éŸ³ã€‚of ç§ å‘ã‘ã«ã« ã¨ã„ã† ã†ã‚“ã€‚ é›¨ãOf™ã‚‹ to‚Ofˆï½„ï¼Žç±³ å°of€‚ it says , i think its time to stitch apes ."
everyone having a d course paid motivation code should be able to create an account and continue to learn using the pp
"i chose to learn russian, i got a word, had to say it best i could, and depending on how well i say it, i would pass."
worthless!
i have it on my computer and that this would be good too.
its not
very professional for a top name brand in language learning.
i don't understand why you have to pay money to just learn a new language on these appsðŸ˜¡
and apparently i learned 2 days worth of german on the very first day.
this is pp is not helpful and i think that goose translate does a better job of teaching languages.
"i signed in, i don't want to use it or get a bill."
i hate it all you do is say it and don't even learn.
what's the hole point.
i don't even know what i am saying.
your a noon a fortunate who ever made this pp.
don't down load it.
you won't know what your saying?
?
i got the pp and have been using it all the time.
personally thought it was great.
this doesn't help learning.
so i will never use this pp anymore.
come on!
now are 4 hearts!
"they have definitely gone back on that for a full, max profits model."
learning a new language is about making mistakes and learning from them.
i haven't progressed since this change.
this is clearly a new recent bug
i loved the pp!
but the last update is really not pleasant!
i'm very upset about this.
it's very confusing.
mistakes are a big part of learning (even do says so! )
!
"domingo was an amazing pp, would've given it 5 stars a couple months ago."
but the latest updated do not promote language learning like they used too.
it's like they took away everything that made this pp work.
would even pay for those features in the future.
right now i want to abandon it.
"makes me feel stupid, sucks my determination to get this learnt."
can't see why it's supposed to help.
"if it's just to make you pay, then i get that."
great pp!
really?
why?
no thanks .
.
.
the pp has been mostly helpful but its frustration to be stuck with nothing to do on it.
"i'm sure the ""improvement"" in user experience makes me want to buy premium."
developer need to address this problem anyone who's eye sight isn't perfect struggles.
i'm not going to pay for plus when i can't see it.
i'm very disappointed.
"i can complete the exercise, if i can hear what is being said."
"i have started over multiple times, because of this problem"
its not worth the frustration.
in just glad i have another pp to help with my studies
"', 'i don't have the cow but i have the leather' etc.)."
didn't have to do that in the past you want too much information
i've always loved this pp.
which means i can move for ward in the lessons and it keeps failing me.
please i would need your assistance to fix this.
thanks
my mon got this pp before it was updated and i got it after.
i dislike the update but otherwise this is a fairly good pp.
"other than that i really, really, really like the application."
:)
a bit disappointing
i guess i'll just have to install the pp
*&#$%!
@Â¥% is what i think about it.
please fix this.
2 stars because there are clot of errors and no developer have responded or fixed!
!
so many features are missing that it's laughable.
i had to do the rest on pp.
if i had to do it on pp then why is there an pp?
i am using the pp for japanese learning.
good idea but very poor implementation.
"nice concept, intuition execution."
has potential.
sons: -lacks depth.
a one month course or podcast can teach you far more than the whole pp.
"this means that out of the 30 minute session, perhaps just 5 minutes are actual content."
"after about 10 min,my son not interested in this pp."
i purchased the d version for my son.
when i saw there was an pp for mobile devices i thought it would be a great addition.
you'll just be guessing at everything.
this is really annoying as i am doing and saying exactly what it wants.
this is why the pp is more bad than good˜’
"decent amount of languages available, but competitors offer a more vast pool and a better complement for language learning."
not a big fan.
literal objects are easy to learn by guessing.
concepts are not.
it's a money grab and languages should be cheap and or free
now i can't do any speaking exercises at all now.
disappointed!
they are only available for is.
"love this pp, really great."
my accent and vocabulary are really improving!
why can't i create an account?
"the pp says it has problems with its system and ask to try to later, but through some time the same happens again."
i have the desktop account which i'm able to login to.
"please, can ye help me."
thank you
seems like it would be a good way to learn i've heard many good things but i would like to learn sign language and it is not an option sadly.
confusing.
you have to guess what each one is
$17 a month?
no thanks.
although it's a really good pp it makes you pay aft we're r so long but i should have expected that
the voice recognition is a of’© emboli.
that would make it more challenging and more like learning a language in the real world.
streamlined interface.
adjective features.
i'm also ambivalent that one can get perfect scores with very floppy studying.
they're more option online which is convenient if you have the time.
"i am using it for japanese and i have only found one translation errors ""excuse me, i am an apple."""
unless that's a popular saying in japan?
other then that i work on it two hours a day and repeat a lot of the lessons and i think it's great of˜Š
domingo is a great pp to learn languages but it is not complete so you don't find every language you are looking for.
otherwise it is really great and if didn't have these issues i would give a five star.
i pay and subscribe so that tells you quite a lot.
"...... please bring back those features"""
i dislike the all or nothing feeling.
get flexible please.
my internet and data both work fine.
and everytime i finish a lesson it changes what level i'm on.
i'm making no progress.
"update: as soon as i wrote the previous comment the pp changed to an is like environment, don't know how, i didn't download an update and i don't let the device do it on its own!"
"so... very strange, right?"
great pp.
i am learning german.
edit : i am having issues with my pp recently.
everything was good until a couple of days ago before i updated the pp to the latest version.
left pp alone for 13 hours thinking i would have almost 3 hearts to practice with but i only had one.
"i've used this pp before and it was pretty good, but i got a new phone and had to download the pp."
tried downloading it again and it's still not working.
i have the pp and the issue is not solved in the latest update.
my review is for the mobile version alone.
it is conceptual good and can teach the basis at the very least.
when i first started i was learning but as things got rougher i started struggling to understand why certain phrases are used and why.
when you're struggling to learn and it shows you're competing against other people you dont know and you drop 10-15 places it kills the moral of learning .
the pp just wasn't what i was hoping for.
"when i growled a way to speak to a fellow japanese student, the answer presented by domingo was ""you can, however, click on someone's name/icon to go to their profile (or ""stream"" as domingo calls it) and post a message to them there."""
this statement is false.
this makes me disappointed in learning foreign language.
so far so good with the learning.
i understand that the free version will serve me as and i'm quite happy to see them.
product search history from shopping apes).
that is super creep.
which makes it awful!
i wish u guns could fix it!
i only figure it out by elimination.
"after introducing ""refreshing"" courses, i find that most of my limited time i spend on the pp is used retreating the same categories over and over, plateauing my progress."
"not bad, but i prefer to use a computer."
mainly because i cannot see my assignment to gage how much i have left to do for my weekly german homework.
this pp was absolutely amazing when i first started it.
"i'm the type of person to need those extra lessons because without them, i won't know when i should move on and i get lost."
"it discouraged me so much, and i haven't touched the pp in weeks."
i'm seriously hoping they change it back.
i love this pp.
i'm using the pp to learn japanese and irish.
i couldn't understand the grammar rules for irish.
thankful someone in the comments posted it.
that's really disappointing.
love the pp because it's easy to use in my busy life.
"i like this pp however, i don't know if it was helpful at teaching me basis like numbers and how to conjugal a verb."
i can access them on the webster version of domingo.
it would be very nice to add them on the pp swell.
it makes it very hard to study without them.
"for a free platform, it's not bad."
i was using the pp both on is and andros an i have to say that being punished for my mistakes in the is pp made me uncomfortable all the time.
now i'm really thinking to delete the pp!
could you pus tell me what are your intentions with this health/hearts system?
"after that you either can complete practice rounds to regain ""health"" or buy them with points."
very annoying.
"also, most aspects of the language grammar are not explained."
this pp is easy to use and helps with memorization.
and you can turn off the speaking and listening features.
"this makes failure impossible to avoid when you are supposed to translate what you hear, and you can't even hear anything."
this makes you fail lessons and interrupt the otherwise enjoyable learning experience in an annoying way.
a 5 star pp without this issue.
this pp has bags that do not allow you to click on the correct response.
it has happened to me more than a dozen times and i've reported it each time.
"for months, these errors have not been fixed."
"because of this, you cannot finish a lesson, or level, and must abort the whole thing."
this happens primarily on the more complex lessons.
most of the pp is just fine.
i tried it seems many people love this pp.
maybe it's just me
"and when i've blown a lesson, i'd hope to get medial on that topic, rather than being quitted on basic vocal; after 75 days and over 75 hours i can generally get cat, dog and monkey correct, but i never really get irregular verbs."
"i may try again sometime, by which time it will be from the very beginning, but while i'd love to learn more i can't devote multi hours daily."
overall it's very hit or miss.
yeah it's money gray with it's price subscriptions yeah it's got false promises and yeah they ask for or money before u even start learning a language...but u are learning a language for free.
you will at least remember something.
please return the sound of™
me.
what vocabulary is there is not incredibly useful.
"i would buy this if i were convinced the lessons contained actual instruction, but i am not convinced they do."
"i am having trouble with letters 3. it has a hiccup and will not acknowledge ""t"" answer even though there are no other option on the watching of letter and symbol."
i can't go any further with the program.
for days it gets to that and stops.
is there a programming problem.
i used domingo for hind before and the problem did not exist.
help!
i'm learning organ and refreshing my french.
"however, organ is not so."
i have to use outside sources to learn about the words.
the lessons don't make sense and there has been zero explanation of honorifics and choosing between different translation option is impossible without outside help.
it's been very frustration.
it's pretty good for a starting point.
there are two major shortcomings though.
(war lumen has 3 meanings depending on context).
for example with german i heard (line) very clearly even when using slow talk.
it wanted miner
the pp is just horrible.
"if you loose all your lives, and you don't finish any lessons, that's it, your streak is done for, and you can't practice!"
i have been using domingo from the past 250 days.
everyone has a different capability to grasp.
!
pp works well and lots of option.
"while i appreciate this to ensure retention it seems this should either take into account lesson goals per day, be optional or like lesson goals have a control for decay rate."
this pp would be rate higher by me but this feature greatly diminishes my learning potential based on my time.
why??
"you're trying to bribe me to buy ""health points""?????"
for the last 2 days you say i have 399 health points instead of the 450 needed to get stuck because got the last question of the lesson wrong????
really????
this happened 3 times.
whatever.....
sometimes it says i am not saying something right when i know i am.
"like ""sin sal""."
"this is the rd pp i've tried and so far, by far the easiest to maneuver."
thanks
hello!
i really like the pp and use it really frequently but i only have one issue after the make.
the pp would have 5/of˜† for me otherwise
good pp.
i've enjoyed using this pp the past few weeks but i'm finding all the tying to be a real pity.
i seriously doubt i'm going to last.
if you want to spell spanish words and type all the time this would be a 5 star pp.
updated dec 21 the repetition type on my phone is getting older by the minute.
get this only to support learning another language
i think it's rude.
if you're attempting to learn a new language you're going to make mistakes and lose hearts.
if you run out of hearts and can get more the progress is lost for that lesson and can start the lesson without hearts to get better at the language.
pretty back.
please!!
"there is no additional into, only tasks!"
"so it's just words memorization, not learning... nonsense (( (the french lessons are great!)"
could i get my gems back please?
"so can you please fix that pitch so we can keep our gems if we don't do the test, and also can i get my gems back as well please!"
"otherwise, i love the pp!"
i installed hoping to solve these problems but still lost all my gems.
the reviews prove this.
are the developer even listening?
"anyhow, i have to take my tablet out of the keyboard case in order to type."
can this be fixed?
it works if i go online.
"this pp continually tells me my answer is incorrect when it matches exactly with what the ""correct"" answer is."
"when i went to the site, i saw hundreds of the same complaints."
hundreds.
frustration!
"overall i like the format, especially that it gets into verbs right away."
"if that part worked, i'd give it 5 stars."
"if they just took out the hearts or gave us more every day, this pp would have 5 stars."
i find the explanations for usage if parts of speech helpful.
how would i even know the differences if it isn't pointed out?
"if those important things are explained, i would give 5 stars"
huge downgrade over the years.
gutted as my brother learnt arabic with it before the heart system was introduced.
"this would be 5 stars but there is a consistent issue where experience points ate not being applied when unlocking levels, the double experience point feature in the shop does not work some of the time as well."
the old version was better.
it's an easy pp to use.
"after every lesson it shoves an add in your face and after that it asks you to buy domingo, premium?"
double check what you are paying for or get unpleasant surprise charges!
it's so good!
"so, 3 stars"
it's not a bad language learning pp.
"besides, what person with a full - time job has time for more than a few lessons a day?"
i really like the domingo method.
unfortunately the pp stopped working and i had to reinstate it.
this erased all my progress and i had to take the placement test again.
a wonderful learning tool.
one of the best and most useful pp for me.
the first few levels were cool.
i am enjoying using this pp.
"so, its slowing my progress."
"my girlfriend has hearts in hers and it's a clear cash grab, very disappointed in this pp."
"ok, one problem."
i recently completed my st checkpoint on my spanish class on domingo.
is: and my double gem wager.
"sayounara, ladies."
it s a system need improving however it's very enjoyable and fun to learn with.
encouraging and inspiring
the pp is clung.
if you're rolling through the lessons then they show up in the order they are supposed to.
this is a great pp!
"for example, under the chinese symbol for eat, put ch«."
"if i am missing that, i'm sorry."
great pp overall!
samson galaxy s.
that only seems logical.
so far so good.
great way to learn a language without going to a class.
the pp is very helpful.
however there are stitches i.e.
that's major frustration because its a major part of learning
very buggy.
worth getting though.
i hope they will change that.
good and exciting when needed
sometimes the learner needs to go back and review his/her items.
it really can help.
also when they do one syllable at a time it is off.
its a great pp and is very useful and helps with my pronunciation but it would have been better if you didn have to pay for other lessons xx
"it's ok, but some free apes are better"
not a bad pp but they where trying to make it like netflix getting that money all the time.
make sure to cancel subscription otherwise till keep filling you forever.
its a nice pp but only lets you go so far for free.
so far it has been a very good pp and i can see it would help me with beginner's french if it wasn't for the fact it costs so much!
such a shame
ok pp.
up to know no problem but it will be hard to member
help me.
it's so so right now.
i'll be back later with an update
sure wish it would stop assuming me to rate it when i have multiple times
so far so good.
will be in a better position to rate better after using the pp for some time
i did not like it only because it would start me off with spanish but i have never read or learned spanish before.
i feel like it doesn't give you a more understanding of connect words.
like (es=is) & (so= i am).
wish i could patch on my course i paid for all those so many years ago so i don't have to start at the the lui mania beginning.
this program very beautiful i wish more developed for the program
"﻿""the pp itself is a convenient learning tool and i enjoy having a cup of coffee while learning a new language every day!"""
"â­of¦‰domingo, in my opinion and experience, ist the number one pp for learning for example german."
"eventough, that's something we can fix with premium!"
and i'm considering it.
this pp is total worth it!
4'5/5!!
!â­ love of’–
i got this pp to learn japanese so i could eventually play japanese games without goose translate.
"the first couple lessons were focused mainly on a small set of characters and the sounds they made, with one or two simple words tossed in."
"the next two lessons also have new characters in it, however are mostly focused on words, and not the new characters."
i can't learn with those.
it is very easy and fun at first.
i have been stuck for days on a level because of this.
it can be frustration and rewarding at the same time.
wonderful to be able to access language learning at home and at a time to suit your own convenience.
"but still, a great pp."
heather
i download to learn makarin.
it's good.
i've learnt numbers and greetings.
"for example i could recognise the numbers and match them to the characters and which were what numbers, but found it hard to just count to 10 on my own."
however a lot of practicing helps
"this is really fun to use, while it is useful as well."
overall pretty good
as a virtual beginner it has given me a good start.
i find i can now read french somewhat but have some difficulty with understanding speech at normal pace.
slow speech i can deal with.
but that's fine.
domingo is an amazing pp for learning a new language!
there is nothing i dislike about the pp.
it may be a server thing.
"but besides that, this pp is definitely worth your time!"
i highly recommend it.
a pleasure to use and fun at the same time.
quite adjective once you move up the leagues.
4 stars :)
domingo is a great pp for casual and on the go people who want to learn a new language.
the pp is better with uncommon languages.
"it's a fun pp, and adjective."
worth checking out at any rate.
this pp is really great for beginners to learn new languages but that is also its limit.
"you have a 5 heart system that if you lose all your hearts, then you either buy domingo plus or you can take more practice, to earn 1 heart back."
the practice tests are unlimited giving you a truly free experience while also encouraging you to practice your language more.
"domingo is a great language learning pp, but it's not perfect."
"any assistance to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated, dance schon!"
"domingo is a very nice, efficient pp for learning languages, which has become a hobby for me now."
"something happened, though, and unfortunately i can't give my full 5 stars."
"i took a test to advance through a lesson which i already know enough about, which i had to use 5 lights for."
can something be done about this?
i love this pp!
"i'm learning latin, because as a writer, it's something that i've always wanted to do."
"domingo is terrific for folks like me, who instinctively ""get"" language and how it's structures."
that's it.
the hardest thing about domingo for me is slowing down so i don't get too frustrated - but that's completely on me.
makes it fun to learn another language i did not give 5 stars as i feel that there still room for improvement.
this is really a handy little pp to help teach you language basis.
easy to get the hang of.
quick to introduce higher level content.
paid pp there isn't a counter.
"paid pp offers office content, free pp doesn't."
this is a solid pp for getting an introduction to just about any language.
i like to practice with this pp for a couple of months before i go an international trip so that i'm not completely lost when i arrive.
i gave it 4 stars because there are bags from time to time.
"otherwise, i think this is a great and useful pp"
this pp has been really good at giving some basic lessons.
other than that i've found this pp really useful at learning some key vocal and sentences.
it's a great way to keep your mind active and learn another language.
there is room for improvement though.
"but i do love the format, ease of use, cracking of progress and my vocabulary is growing."
thank you!
"really helpful overall, with a few issues."
"i'm doing the japanese lessons, and there a couple of things other users have mentioned as not quite correct."
"as long as you do the research on your own, you can figure these issues out."
"overall, fun and useful!"
this pp is a great way to learn how the speak in a different language.
my only problem is that if you take a break off the pp then when you come back you might not remember clot of the translations.
i tell you it is worth the paid version i was frustrated with the free version i love this pp it has really helped me expand my vocabulary and understand verbs the only reason why it's not five stars is because i'm not that great at spanish yet ll and i think it would be nice to have practice conversations somehow in the pp not just random things like your cat is pretty.
this is a good pp .
for example a certificate which you could print off to remind yourself of how far you have progressed in your study.
i really like this pp!
a great pp overall!
"it's good, but lacks some needed features."
fun intuition learning experience.
therefore i personally almost always get the first try of those wrong.
how can i solve it?
a great way to learn a language!
easy to use and fun too.
it isn't fun having to put up with that nonsense.
i've been using this application and all was great since last week.
"encouraging to succeed, that is built into the pp, so helps you continue trying language.. but quite clung program."
but grateful for access.
great tool for language practice on the go.
it's perfect for learning languages.
although that would probably be more difficult to teach with how this pp is set up.
i love this pp.
it allows me to continue to practice and use the language that i learned without having a native speaker to speak with.
excellent pp to enhance learning.
and what they mean.
i mix them up to much.
i've to close the pp and open it again to fix it and sometimes it still doesn't work.
i hope you will fix this soon
stay focused and keep with it.
then i can not complete the course˜
that's actually a good solution.
domingo is fun again!
ultimately i don't think i make a lot of progress.
i'm trying to expand my limited french vocabulary and domingo is definitely refreshing my knowledge and improving my speech.
this pp seems pretty solid!
great pp.
"wife already learned german, had many conversations in german with local speakers."
i'm learning spanish now that we are stateside.
thought it would be more useful.
can't wait to be able to communicate better with my soldiers.
it discourages me from using the pp.
"before, we could even congratulate the weekly dinners."
i hope the domingo team take all these into consideration and effect.
this pp is so amazing!
"it helps me a lot in learning french, english, and organ."
can you tell me what should i do or please fix this?
thank you.
nice program.
learning japanese.
training based on three weeks of use.
pretty good pp.
i just download it and have all ready learned a lot.
great selection of languages.
very easy to learn and the pp slowly increases difficulty.
please improve this function.
thanks of˜Š
very useful for learning french.
i have to say that i had passed the beginning levels in a class and that is why it was easy for me.
i don't know how to report the problem!
thanks for the good days
a bit too much forceful and overlay motivation.
but it might be only because i am older and know what i want.
i do appreciate the work and time that went into producing the rumania course.
i t is imperative that these at least be reviewed by a native english speaker!
"so far, so good."
"i have no idea if it's teaching me latin american spanish or european spanish, but being a beginner, it might not matter right now."
"(are you listening, pp developer?)"
that needs to be fixed.
great pp i feel like i'm learning more here than in spanish class.
"i like the pp, i like the languages it promotes and the learning program and everything."
"so, that's the only part i don't like."
great pp and fun to use.
"all the lessons are beneficial though, especially for a free pp & i can certainly recommend it."
i like it clot but if i had not previously doubled in the language i would be totally lost.
like i said if i had not doubled in the language in my younger years i would have thrown my phone across the room and quit.
it should be available to all.
hopefully domingo will change this.
excellent and getting better.
a bit harder for beginners with no knowledge.
"would like to see more done, such a new fun and situation activities."
the new reading one is excellent!
"idioms, flirting phrases and 3 outfits is it so far."
great for not letting my a level knowledge get rusty after years :).
great and free.
it's a lot of fun and i would recommend it to anyone who is totally new to a language.
i download domingo to learn arabic.
"because of this, i've stopped using the pp and moved on to a study guaranteed to reach only ma."
"for other languages, this pp is a no brazier."
i find that too be very strange when there are so many lesser spoken languages
"if i was rating only the learning experience, 5 stars."
the lessons are fun and effective.
"i'm learning so much, and enjoying the process."
the pp itself is 4 stars.
"the approach to learning is fun and easy, though."
"very, very quick work to get it online."
congratulations to the epic volunteers of™‚
"suggestions from users are, however, mostly accepted."
really great for free version!
i have had a great experience using this for the last week.
refreshing my spanish because i've lost connection to my mother tongue.
wondering if it'sin the works as i'ma hands on learner.
i also have the keyboard download on my phone to use as an option.
hope to see this included if it's not.
:)
a very good way to learn the basis of a language.
the pp is great!....
of˜Š
great pp for learning a new language.
i can only compare to the roseola stone pp which is obviously a lot more expensive in comparison.
if this was included i would definitely buy the premium.
a great pp to get your feet wet in learning a new language.
"sometimes, however, it is not always accurate."
"well the final two remaining were ""press"" which means ""you're welcome "" in english, but the only remaining option to select was ""thank you""."
this could be very confusing to many people!
that would help.
"great pp, very helpful."
"my wife and i are learning french together, and we are having so much fun!"
there is one issue i can think of.
"i am currently in the ruby league, and for the achievement i need to be in the gold league."
"sure, you can take the long way through the language, but it's time consuming and annoying."
doesn't completely replace traditional instruction but does a good job.
this pp was great.
"so, would domingo solve this problem?"
it's a wonderful application.
i am an english speaker who had been studying japanese for 2 years prior to using this pp.
"the pp is very easy to use, but i have encountered some problems."
i also speak german so i practice on this pp.
hopefully this will become better in the future.
"so far, very easy to use and in learning quickly."
"but i am learning, so there's that."
it has many different languages to choose from.
this pp is amazing!
i love everything about!
"i'm currently trying to speak french and organ, and so far i'm doing good in french!"
i'd like to study any time without having to wait.
"so far, good job!"
it requires your effort to learn properly.
"but it's a good pp, functional, and with more effort i feel i could learn well !"
great pp.
"because some people don't want to write to someone, or something like that."
"but, domingo is great in all other ways."
"however, it is staying 4 of´ until it is added."
and i really wanted to give this pp 5 of´.
pretty good pp.
very useful.
four stars but overall the pp is great.
so far i've really enjoyed learning with domingo.
however i am learning the fundamentals of sentence and word construction.
i don't recommend only using domingo though.
"overall a good pp, it's just a bit hard to get used to."
hopefully i can learn better the more i use it though.
this is a really helpful pp.
i've learned so much already since i started using it.
but it can be very frustration in the way that some of the features work.
i love it.
i can't believe how much i am learning.
plus it is free.
i'm i upgrade that one day.
"so new earners with scratch their heads in confusion as to why ""boy"" is spelled as ""black"" but in other phrases and exercises as ""bhallaic""."
this may also apply to languages with declensions.
"for context, i was learning german through english."
really easy to use.
"i really love it, and it's easy to control yourself go keep doing it and it won't takes long everyday."
"oh whatever, it's really a good pp."
download it!!!
)
"learning arabic, german and french on do is fun."
"there may be a few little flakes, but these can be discussed in the forum."
"for becoming a client speaker, you should immense yourself in a language in different ways though."
this is a great pp for languages.
"i'm in th grade, and i'm trying to learn organ."
"other than that, i love this pp and i really recommend it."
this is an awesome application.
try for reading this comment and for making this pp and dating it â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
i appreciate having an pp that actually helps me learn spanish.
"if so, then the slow pace is on me."
domingo enables me to extensively practise polish.
both in reading and in writing.
"it is a good tool to practise speaking as well, however that is completely up to you, not required by the pp nor checked by the pp."
for that purpose i bought a book.
this is pp is unique.
"there is one problem, though."
i lately have gotten too much homework to complete in one night.
so i set domingo aside... and didn't have enough gems to buy streak freeze for 4 days.
"not only the moscow that didn't deserve this, but my streak, gone."
however i have loved every moment of using this pp
love this!
so convenient to use!
instead of spending mindedness hours on social media doing nothing you can learn something!
easy to follow and learn from...i didn't give it 5 stars only as it isn't perfect but it does appear as if they welcome the feedback to improve the software.
i enjoy learning the languages on do lingo.
good and simple.
this pp offers a way to learn english every day.
"its good actually, i'm learning a lot."
"but still a good pp, probably just me, but please do some minor improvement for people like me that can easily get bored."
hoping for a fun learning experienceeee
"so far, very interesting and fun way to refresh my basic level of spanish."
already recommended to some friends.
"after 3 years of studying japanese in school, i couldn't tell you any anti."
"now with domingo, i feel like a pro!"
much more confident speaking to my family in japan.
this is a decent pp for beginning to learn spanish.
"really educational, fun and easy to use."
it has been very helpful in getting basic phrases down.
i like using it when i want to relax and to my surprise i have managed to memories some expressions and words although my sporadic use of it.
"i think is a nice pp to use in one's free time to learn without stress and effort, but ease and comfort."
very good.
fun.
otherwise everything is good.
might just be my phone?
but it only happens with domingo.
i find it easy to use.
it has built my confidence and desire to stick with the effort to learn spanish.
love the pp.
this prevents me from moving on to the next question..please fix.
i'm using motor go-plus
good language learning pp that can be used for free without too many inconvenience.
it is a good pp for learning new ranges.
"domingo straits you off with basic levels, there is different subjects."
pretty good overall but has a few issues.
it's nice to use but i don't really like to type a lot.
it's finicky.
but overall i like the pp.
most of the times it's easy to use.
"been great learning it so far, easy to use while traveling or just have an extra moment."
it might later as i'm still new to this.
"great overall, glad to be learning!"
!
"other than that, it's great!"
i don't know how to explain it but i did learn quite a bit but for some reason i can't quite comprehend i could say or get the whole lesson class and leveling doesn't quite seem right or feel right if that makes any sense at all?
this is a great way to develop language skill.
sometimes i confused in many words so i can't share my problem with them .
"i love this pp, so far give learnt clot."
i think it would help in the learning process.
"it is a great pp, i'm learning spanish and i think it is very effective."
i really love this pp.
they are not as clear as i would like them.
i have learned though how to see the characters in hind.
really learning clot.
thanks!
it is a very helpful pp.
i am learning french and it is so much easier and fun to learn.
i recommend it.
misleading it says learn english.
fun and easy to use for now.
sure it will be getting harder.
i work on five sessions a day and am progressing well in french.
i hope duoliongo can solve this problem sooner.
this pp is perfect to learn languages.
if there is martha included then i am sorry for the comment.
of˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜„of˜„
"the pp generally works well, my phone case makes it hard to complete the speaking sections."
so insane!
makes learning foreign languages easier than other methods for free.
"pretty good pp for learning languages, especially for a free pp."
"domingo, please fix this."
"feels like a game, but you're learning a new language."
super easy.
i love this pp!
it has been a great way for me to learn garlic!
"still, it's a great pp!"
i recommend it all the time.
i'm glad i have this to both review for my spanish courses and even learn irish garlic from my heritage.
thank you developer!
"""some girls are cleaner than others""."
many fun and similar phrases to follow!
that would be useful.
great application for learning and improving language levels.
very easy to use and learn from.
except when you asked in the comments for others opinion.
overall the pp is excellent.
a nice pp.
"but, overall, enjoyable."
very educational and very fun it lets you learn a lot of different languages!
domingo so far has been very helpful in my learning experience.
"i personally need a lot more practice with learning new things, and thanks to this pp, i can do that without burdening anyone else."
purely amazing!
it is very helpful and even refreshed your newly acquired knowledge of the language.
this is the perfect pp for learning a language.
"very nice pp, with nice exercises."
haven't spent to much time on it but so far it seems that it can provide a nice introduction to languages.
i've tried their names and email yet it keeps saying no results found.
still this is a great way to learn a language that you like.
i'm having a great time learning a new language.
i really enjoy using this pp and the challenges it presents when learning a language.
my boyfriend who is german was caught off guard when i told him good morning in german.
keep plugging along and hope to improve.
i think this pp is helping me to wrap my brain around spanish.
i find it fun and just enough challenge to want to come back.
i am enjoying the learning experience
"i'm really liking the way it allows me to check that, i'm getting the understanding of what i'm saying and, the pronunciation of each word so that i am not sounding like a nut âœŒ"
great pp.
"a good, free option to practice another language."
i really enjoy this pp.
thanks!
very good.
other than that its amazing .of˜ŠðŸ˜Š
"overall, i love it."
please fix this.
otherwise the pp is great.
don't always have time to get them.
personally i think that they are useless of˜¤
bow it's pretty helpful.
very easy to learn if you have the time and eagerness.
above average to excellent.
to have a free pp that drills one in a language is quite excellent.
"there are a few bags (greek), but overall an pp i heartily recommend."
"if you are trying to learn a language, domingo is free, try it."
i have taken spanish for at least 4 or more years in my life but haven't been consistent.
i love the culture and language.
plus its free!
great and easy way to pick up a new language.
the lessons are progressive and fun.
you can also check on translations by clinking on the words to check.
enjoyable and educational.
has some faults but only slight and altogether a brilliant pp
good pp.
assisting me in learning a tough language in a very easy and playful way.
just love it.
really helpful and pleasant to use.
it is wonderful!
i recommend this pp.
so far good.
simple to use.
user friendly.
all positive.
i don't need them to ensure engagement
"a good teaching pp for sure, and it is not a play to learn scar...i am excited and really do believe that if i apply myself daily with this tool, i can actually become client!"
i like the style of learning.
my reading is still better than my speaking.
my hearing and understanding is improving.
"i've been instructed to ""use an apple product"" which i dont like or use."
"i'm feeling a little s** on, here... i'll request a refund before spending $800 on a new phone, just so i can use their product!"
will update if they ever correct this...
"it's fixed, but that was weird."
are.
for a 12 year old this is pretty fun it gives you many ways to learn and it pretty easy to i am trying to learn japanese
"there is a free version with limited use and adds, it will bug you to buy the premium thing but you dont have to."
"it will give you new words without a definition, but your allowed to look at the translation."
really great over all
so far so good.
the pp is also easy to use.
i love this program.
the exercises are interesting and helpful.
it's like i am playing a game but learning a language!
if this is enabled i rate all stars.
this is a really good pp!
i haunt memories clot yet but it is probably because it is my first day.
its great and the apes seems to be working well.
i am trying the trial and i have decided that i want to get it for my family and myself.
very nice pattern to learn any new language.
i can say it's best.
free lesson is great but u have to pay for other lessons.
but its good though.
genius!
i can feel my brain making associations.
strangest thing but beautiful to recognise.
no english even needed!
"so far, so good."
"just started, but this seems the best pp i have found so far to learn italian."
it seems like a good pp so far.
i just wish learning these different languages didn have to cost anything...i mean that's what everyone lacks is communication skill regardless of region.
but it's not my call ll
learning has never been easier.
so far this pp is very helpful with learning a new language.
it's not easy learning japanese but so far i'm having fun doing it.
not a really great experience if you don't pay .
my knowledge of hebrew vocabulary is the only reason i have any idea what i'm saying or hearing.
nice pp and very user friendly.
i would say this language software is a great supplement to learning a new language.
easy patterns and simple instructions.
all you need is persistence and the willing to learn.
i like the pp.
it helps me with my homework and other languages i always wanted to dear
it's really good (^^)!
good pp and walks you through easily and logical
interactive and information .
very straightforward and practical
pretty good.
the 30 min lesson took less than 30 minutes.
please help
good job with having you repeat words so you retain it with images.
it could be fun if only i had the attention span to keep up with it
a great pp for learning a new language intuitively.
simply asking you to try again.
that said it is a brilliant pp and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn a new language.
i used it and went to a french conversational class.
"early days so no conversational stuff yet, but a really good foundation."
"so far, so good."
"even with those issues, roseola stone works well for me, even with its 'throw em in the water and hope they swim' strategy."
it actually works and helps me learn the verbs and grammar of the target language without explanation.
"i must say, thanks, roseola stone!"
it's pretty good!!
"the mobile version of roseola stone is great, but has some flaws."
"mild annoyance, but overall worth your time and money."
user friendly and i am learning.
"especially in the beginning, you don't want to mess up the basis."
"even though it wouldn't be the first pp i would use, it is still really great practice!"
i like roseola stone's approach.
"the zero translation and repetition until it sticks seems to work best for me even if it can feel a little tedious at the time, it's still fun to use."
good way to learn on the go.
i'd like to know exactly what i'm saying you know ?
other than that i really like it.
it's a very useful and well put together pp and program.
in only on lesson 2. i am familiar with japanese.
"its seems good at introducing vocal and grammar, as well as anti."
i enjoy spending time on it.
great pp.
pretty good so far.
great pp to learn from
find spend more time with this language pp than others.
pat
that is aggravating.
otherwise the program seems to function well for other lesson types.
great!
there are exercises focused on this to which are very useful.
i love how easy it is to use
this could have been bad.
it's still an easy awesome way to learn.
"i like it, i'm learning- slowly."
so far so good.
even without doing the initial into to explain it were able to figure what they were doing in the pictures.
so far so good.
good pp for simple learning french quickly.
immersion works better than vocabulary for me personally
i'm trying to learn a language for a trip coming up.
yes it really is good.
but thought it was free.
just unit 1 is available.
but that's fine.
thanks
easy to use.
easy memorization.
"after having my eyes set on roseola stone for several years i've come to discover that there are better products for less, such as domingo or memories."
good and clear pronunciation.
i like it.
am sure my pronunciation is improving as i move ahead learning
but i'm learning and that's a big plus thanks
quite enjoyable tool indeed.
it is a fun learning experience.
thank you roseola stone.
"so far, so good."
i'll check back in once i'm past chapter 1... :)
really good at helping you retain information
working fine so far
"i am just at the beginning , i like it."
it is easy to understand and learn
i've only completed a few lessons but am already picking it up.
i like it so far.
user friendly pp!
works well to teach language.
very good and easy
it's a process for sure but a great tool for learning
very nice and helpful
learning curve made easy
"just getting started so too early to give 5 stars, but so far this is great!"
i think it's very good.
this pp make you learn the language.
"great so far, but really a refreshed."
interested in how it will progress.
"it's great for the deal they are offering, brings them at or below the cost of the other paying services"
what am i saying?
it tells me with pictures and act- but what am i saying exactly?
very helpful in grasping a foreign language
easiest way to learn s new language should use this in schools rather then a teacher
simple to use and convenient
it's easy to use and a fun way to learn
a great addition to other programs
easy to learn and use
they give you the perfect platform to start to learn is up to you to be consist that so don't blame the program blame yourself for not being consistent on doing the work
so far easy to start and learn st lesson!
"learn, fun & easy tool(:"
good pp to refresh with as well as learn
otherwise i feel i am learning
this is my first time learning another language on an pp and i am very thankful for your pp you very much for helping me trying to learn new english new languages to learn and talk any languages with my friends
working on spanish using both roseola and domingo.
"so far i feel they work similarly, but i personally enjoy roseola more"
educational and engaging.
great and fun
it's good for your fleecy and help you spell and be a good reader.
i to like this pp can help a lot of people in the world ask me my parents my family everybody in the world can you this pp.
i find it very useful and convenient
just starting week 2 (day 9).
fun is not the right word.
but effective might be.
we'll see.
fun and easy!
i tried learning portuguese as kid by using roseola stone.
i was easily distracted and i didn't learn the language.
now that i am older i am able to appreciate the pp by how it reaches someone how to learn a language.
truth be told.
"trust me, i am already seeing great results with my makarin class."
learning to speak spanish by thinking in spanish.. now.. the pp.is really good..
and the monkey lips the switch.
its great to learn a new language
this program is the best at learning a new language
very nice and well done!
i think i am catching on.
will see how it goes.
very satisfied so far with unit 1 completion
fun learning and needs working here and there but great
perfect pp for learning new languages....although its not with languages that you need to advance in..... i recommend it to everyone i know ) bow its one of the best free apes i know...even when or lives are out (they are 5) you can get more lives by practicing which is even better !
known as the elite language learning program for a reason 
i know how to order food in german however this program helps me learn the details with the german language.
have to guess the vocabulary once in a while but perhaps it was deliberate to keep users attention.
"if you give it serious time (not 5 minutes a day like they advertise, but more like an hour or two daily), this learning method actually works well to get you started with a language."
"amazing learning tool for those who want to set a foundation for learning a language, me personally chose russian and i feel like i am learning a good amount, you just need to dedicate time and effort, i also recommend tiny cards and then follow the language you're learning to help practice and perfect the language of your choice."
hopefully i will have russian killed in eventually.
just need to put in the work.
"overall, great free pp and i love domingo!!"
!
a wonderful and revolutionary pp.
wonderful to use before to study up for trip abroad.
"where's the pp that makes learning history, path, or other subjects fun?!"
thank you for your service and helping those who commit to continuous learning and growth.
an excellent language pp.
fun to use.
"lessons depend on the category chosen & can be phrases in your home language & the language you are learning, write what you have heard, speak the phrase or word, enter missing words, vocabulary."
see which languages others are learning.
"complete as little or more daily or less frequently, easy to pick up again."
"but for a free pp, that genuinely reaches you the language and how to spell and pronounce things correctly."
it is great.
there really are no shortcuts and you have to stick with it.
if you want to learn a language you can.
this pp is great and makes it easy to get into your routine.
just beware of the owl if you leave your modifications on.
he will remind you.
i have been using the pp for a week and so far is good.
i am learning spanish and german and slowly starting italian.
"with many option, it's easy to learn a new language at your own pace."
this pp is very fun and educational.
it makes learning a new language easy and fun!
i would give you 100 stars if i could.
i really appreciate this pp.
"well, it is not a bad application... i mean, it is too similar to a game but if you pay attention and follow the advice the pp itself gives (read each lesson out loud and write the new vocabulary you learn after practicing), then you will probably get the basic knowledge such as sounds and simple vocabulary."
"so, it is recommended to beginners but you can't stop here."
i would highly recommend this as a method of learning a second language.
i have learnt more grammar in a very short period than i have with other language learning software.
love domingo and my portuguese is getting so much better!
"other than that, this pp is absolutely great!"
the two languages are so similar and it would be much easier to learn being italian my first language!)
very nice pp.
there are a lot of things that might be useful if you are learning new language.
"it is easy, funny and useful."
highly recommended this pp when you are learning either at home or outside.
this surely is the best free language learning pp available.
it makes learning real easy and fun.
plus it keeps you motivate and its just amazing.
you can set the bar low but when you start you almost dont want to quit.
so in my opinion its definitely worth a try!
"domingo is a great pp for learning, absolute 5 stars, its great, i love it, the lessons are very intriguing and i love, just love the cut little animation on the lessons, when i'm doing my japanese lessons, i always loved the lessons little pictures, but those little animation are perfect!"
yes.
"it's really good and allows a varied method of teaching , i love the competition with up and story mode."
so helpful for learning a language.
best pp for this i've found.
a very enjoyable pp.
"a wonderful learning platform.......step by step lessons.....enough of practice to make you remember everything that you have learnt.....it reaches you reading, writing, speaking, listening, all of them.....and the best is all of this is completely free......must use pp"
this pp is fantastic!
"you learn to read, speak, and write the words!"
"if you run low on health, you can practice to gain hearts!"
this pp is amazing and i recommend it to anyone wanting to learn a new language(s)!
two thumbs waaaaay way up!
of‘of»of‘of»
this pp is truly amazing.
you can learn a whole new language just by practicing everyday.
this pp is very helpful and i feel that i can become client in the language i am learning using this pp and this pp alone.
i absolutely love it!
it would help with trying to remember words without having to be in lessons.
"other than that, i absolutely love the pp."
it has helped me so much!
i can get by in french and am using domingo to get up to date.
"between the pp and the webster, you've got yourself a perfectly useful way to learn languages any time and just about anywhere."
and free?!
yes!!!
no catches.
you can bang out a few good lessons while on the toilet... or waiting for the bus... or in any short moment that you get throughout the day.
the key is to stick with it and let it's game-style structure show you the way.
i was impressed in how the pp manages to integrate so many methods and functions for becoming comfortable with a foreign language.
maybe in the future?
"thank you to the developer for a great, free tool!"
"the pp lets you get into a new language rather random, but in a great speed."
well done!
"great pp in grain mode, even better when you pay :)"
amazing.
"i'm using the pp to learn japanese from english currently, and although it's definitely suited for teaching spanish, french, and german, it's still the best way to learn japanese that i've found that actually gives you the whole language for free as well as reaches you both how to speak the language and how to read it."
most japanese learning apes i've used only do one or the other.
i highly recommend this pp.
it's simple a simple enough pp.
"i'm not far into the pp yet, but it seems good so far!"
some things can be frustration but that's more due to the lessons than the pp itself.
"if you enjoy domingo, this pp is for you"
this pp helps me so much!
i've made so much progress over the last 2 years and i love everything about it!
thank so much for creating domingo!!!
!
!
easy and fun for all ages.
my girls all have the pp and we are learning as a family.
"we are learning a new language for fun, and fun is what we are getting out of this learning pp."
thanks
free and really works!
i started taking spanish in the rd grade and all through school and struggled greatly barely passing or worse and could never retain anything i learned.
i dont know how this pp works but suddenly i am remembering words and am able to use them and have real conversations in spanish.
i'm learning a lot from this pp.
like when i translate something or pick the correct translated word.
be careful of types!
domingo is helpful in learning a new language.
it is not the only tool you should use but it is a great tool.
one the best apes for language learning i have came across.
currently learning spanish and maintained a 6 month streak so far.
"you will appreciate the efficiency, fun methods and great flexible features that it provides."
very highly recommended
honestly amazing!
"this pp only take 5 minutes for each lesson, (depending on how fast you complete the lesson) its easy to use and it's for free!"
and that's a great price.
:)
brilliant way to learn spanish.
it drills it into your unconscious while also explaining the grammar.
"very helpful, and they've definitely made improvements over the years."
"love the pp, really thankful that it's free!"
great pp!
lessons move at a steady pace without being overwhelming.
i just love this pp.
does not work all the time.
so easy to learn.
"doing some spanish, portuguese and a the italian.of˜"
please fix it
great so far!
i feel like this is one of the best self study apes.
this has helped me learn some languages in an attention grafting way
extremely simple and practical.
"i find myself doing a little practice every day effortlessly, even with multiple languages added."
very useful for maintaining and developing competence in my second languages.
"domingo is a ""lucky"" way to learn a language: it requires you to largely work out the rules of the target language yourself, but that is exactly what babies and tollers do."
it is just one tool among the many which you need to use to learn a new language.
it has flaws but don't treat the course seriously.
serious studies are elsewhere.
"great, utterly and simply great."
love damn near everything about it and then you switch over to a desktop version and it gets even better.
what are you waiting for download it now and get started!!!
!
love it.
in learning so much.
i might not be able to speak bluntly but i can read and understand what others say.
and i can speak a little of it.
try it.
it really is.
this is quickly becoming one of my favorite activities.
it's surprisingly adept at building preserved memories of the subject matter.
i really love this pp and it really helps me with my language skill.
i really recommend this pp if you want to learn a language easily and enjoyable!
"love this pp, not complicated & easy to understand and use for beginners."
in doing french.
really enjoying learning spanish with domingo.
recommended
"well, i'm hooked!"
download this pp to learn how to speak a bit of german for when i go to berlin soon and it's fantastic!
"only con - so many languages and so little time :p. they are also always improving the pp, taking in feedback."
sign of good developer and project management.
glad i gave it a shot.
working on an 18 day streak so far!
"great language pp, especially as it's free."
"i overthink things personally and this pp definitely just helps me move along, easing all questions i may have."
the lessons are understandable and fun.
5 stars all the way!of˜„
"its amazing, i only got it for 5 minutes so far and already know quite a lot of words."
i have tried a few language apes and so far this one is the best head and shoulders above the others.
in on a 2 week streak and dont see myself stopping.
i like that they respect a user like that
it is really good!
i am beginning to enjoy the pp.
i find that little difficult of˜• to do it just be listening!
!
the most amazing pp on play store.
delivered much more than what i expected.
and that's for free.
i look forward to my 15 min everyday!
i'm also an learning developer and i'm very impressed with the innovative and fun learning features!
thank you domingo!
i wish there were more companies out there like you!
i'm grateful!
its a great pp!
it helps you understand the words you are struggling on!
"i'm learning japanese, i'd recommend this to my friends!"
incredible .fun.
me enfants domingo .
very good pp when learning basic word and phrases.you could learn and try or you could just be a liar and right a bad review.for me it helped a lot with my french test and english plus turkish.i would give it 10 stars but 5 should jumpstart it.
"download it know if u want to speak like a pro.learn with do the owl and speak like a legend or be there and read boring books about languages which are 200pg long.dealing's motor should be ''learn today, speak tomorrow.''"
download it for extra help.
this pp is amazing!
i'd recommend it to anyone!
it's an amazing way to learning a language with free and fun.
love it!
as someone who studied languages all through school and never felt like i made any progress i have been delighted with how much progress i have made with domingo.
i would definitely recommend!
this way you can associate the word with the written word.
just like reading.
"it's like the perfect learning structure, it's awesome, i've learned and processes more words in just a few lessons as a beginner than i ever thought i would!"
"it's been 50 min, first impressions so far the pp is amazing."
super helpful for learning a language.
and it is free.
score.
i love it!
then it is a little harder.
working great!
the best language learning pp.
"a great way to sharpen, learn and maintain language skill"
i'm trying to learn spanish and domingo makes it super easy.
i took 4 years of spanish in highschool so the bits i remember have helped me too but i feel like i'm learning actually important words and phrases through this pp.
this pp is marvel and has helped my learning in german a lot.
it has some odd quires occasionally but over for it is fabulous as a free pp.
love this pp.
great supplement for reviewing things i've learned in class.
would definitely recommend it.
i love it because it's a fun and easy way to learn a language.
that's why it's a 5 star rating.
my boys really love this game.
simple but really good.
they are really excited to play it every day.
great way to introduce them to a different language
i love learning languages on this pp it is very useful.
please fix this issue.

i can give you five thumbs up because i dont have enough fingers.
j.
but still love this.of‘keep toward!
brilliant!
great methods of teaching .
steady competition along with reaching makes learning fun.
"fairly new to this, but i'm enjoying my experience so far."
"i'm not a quick learner, so maybe it's me and not the pp."
even then most of the time it doesn't work.
i really like how much information i am retaining.
"i can't stress how much i high recommend this to everybody, i wanted to give the pp 6 stars!!"
!
"honestly a great way to learn, considering it's an pp."
this pp is amazing !!!
loved it !!!
"if there would be option, i would give it 10 stars."
i have learnt italian language from this pp.
and i recommend to install this pp of˜of¤—
i love this!
"makes it so easy to learn,and you can revise things over again!"
it's so flexible!
great!!
!
makes learning easy to understand.
i paid for rabble for a year and hardly used it.
it always felt like a chose and it didn't seem worth the cost (especially since i've had to stop working because of health issues).
fastforward to finding domingo: now this is an pp i can get into!
the format feels like a real game and not a lesson.
i really have a chance to improve now!
thanks do!
of˜Š
"nice pp, progress at your own pace."
i like the different sections i.e.
"travel, food, etc"
i'm definitely befitting and learning spanish quickly.
in learning french to better communicate with my wonderful love and so far this pp has been helping me better than any class i've ever been in.
i highly recommend this for anyone wanting to learn additional languages.
amazing language learning pp.
i love the pp style and hope they keep it like that.
again a brilliant pp and the teaching system is great.
the pp has really helped me with learning new languages.
"the league system also helps, as it encourages you to do more lessons."
"you can get a new skin for do with them, and occasionally you can buy extra lessons with them, but other than that, they don't feel very important or useful."
"i feel like i should spend them, but there's nothing to spend them on."
so far this pp is the best resource i have had for learning languages.
i love this pp.
i'm currently studying japanese.
"i used separate apes to learn katakana on my own, but it'd be nice if i didn't have to use multiple apes."
"anyhow, this pp is great."
thanks domingo!
great way to learn or improve your language skill...for free!
it's a close friend of mine for about five years now.
but recently i have a unbelievable problem with it.
i am trying to fix this problem because it's not so easy to forget this friend so soon.
i hope it will be fixed in the next update.
(please!)
"it's really helpful and easy to use, my english improved a lot after that i started using this pp, i really recommend"
great pp.
this pp is ideal to learn a new language.
even if you are not a native speaker you can easily speak that language bluntly within a span of a few months.
great pp.
"as are never fun, but they've got to make money somehow from us freeholders."
"learn to write, speak, and hear from a multitude of languages."
best language pp i've ever used with great incentive.
reaches as well as a a face to face class.
i love this pp so far!
i'm trying to learn japanese and for the basis it's really making it easy to study.
i like it very much.
5 stars is not enough.
it's a great pp and i have learnt a lot of french from this pp.
"overall, this is a wonderful pp and i have been using it for a long time."
so easy and fun.
very good pp.
this is absolutely amazing.
"i wanted to learn japanese, just to add some fun into my life, and it's working perfectly!"
thank you for it being free!
"this is probably a common complaint, but i usually hit the stop as with super do on accident."
thank you!
i love the pp.
an absolutely phenomena educational application.
"while many sites and courses build their content on technical levels, with everything being taught as machine-like and algorithmic, domingo is a breath of fresh air that truly attempts to imbibe fleecy in its users."
"it's the difference between translating ""je suis content(e)"" to ""i am happy"" and understanding ""je suis content(e)"" as ""je suis content""."
"to any one searching for an aid to learning language, with ample practice, do is the way."
the best way to learn a new language that i've ever tried!
"i am not good at learning languages, but i actually find myself remembering the lessons from domingo whereas i never could remember anything using other methods."
overall love it though!
the best language learning application i have ever used.
it's free and the material is fantastically done to help you learn fast and remember.
it has a huge list of languages.
there is one ad at the end of each lesson.
so they dont bug you every second.
definitely worth more than 5 stars.
"a amazing pp for language learning,easy to use and free!there are some as, obviously,but you can buy a ""paid version"" to remove those as;despite that, it's a fantastic pp,i would recommend it for anyone who is interested in learn a language."
i love domingo!
i especially like two aspects of learning with domingo.
"this is best pp for learning languages, it is easy and so fun to learn, i love it"
i love this pp.
it's amazing and we can learn any language for free.
it awesome i would definitely share this to everyone
i'm learning a lot of vocabulary and verb conjugations.
it's fun and easy.
"i'm really enjoying my ""do"" time!"
"i've been using this pp for years, starting with the domingo webster version."
"i haven't always stuck with my lessons, but when i have i've made noticeable progress in my chosen language."
"even when i stopped for over a year, i hadn't forgotten what i learned."
"domingo uses the same method as the very expensive roseola stone computer software (immersion), and they do it for free."
absolutely 5 stars.
i have never got such an experience from a language learning application before.
i have been using it for something like over a week and overall i still am amazed at how it makes me want to learn new things each day sometimes multiple times a day.
"an easy and productive way to learn, practice and experience languages."
i really like the fact that domingo in general has improved.
"(keeping streaks, setting your daily challenge) overall, i find it a good tool to help learn a language, not entirely sure whether it can teach the language completely but at the very least, it is a very good stepping stool."
amazing pp that helps learn languages for free.
"i can't believe this pp, this is free(like literally), very very easy to go with and this is some high quality stuff.."
the fattest and easiest way to learn a new language!
"five days into the week, i have 150 or so up."
i'm in with.
second and third sit at about 350 up.
even placing high enough to advance to the fourth bracket is pretty involved.
"i expected the character to be wearing it all the time through the pp, not just when it peeped in during lessons."
otherwise i feel it was a waste of gems to purchase them.
p.s.
please find a way to turn down the volume on it.
"i have 70000+up in spanish, and 4000+ in french, yet i hated this pp more that i liked it."
"just my fondness for languages, and it being free (i'm frugal) kept bringing me back."
loved it!
i think i can endure the as now.
good work team!
much more effective than using a physical language book.
"really nice pp, very advanced learning system."
i love this pp for a few reasons.
love it!
this webster helped me keep an a in my language classes end after i finish my glasses i was able to get even better at the same witches and even learn more.
i would definitely recommend this to any students and people who just simply want to learn another language.
this pp is amazing.
"it helps cream the words in my mind, and even gives pro tips!"
"for example: ""to so juan."""
"the 'to' is not needed, since 'so' already means 'i am'."
"i'm just assuming that you might say 'to so' to be more formal, maybe?"
that's what i don't know.
"otherwise, 5 stars!"
the way domingo reaches is very good and shows you many sentence examples that will help you make your own in your language of choice.
"although there are times that it feels grind, but that's how you actually learn the language and be able to speak and write it."
"i think the office feature is worth purchasing, too."
if you want to practice languages anywhere efficiently i highly recommend this one!
it's surprisingly simple to use with its neat design and layout unlike many apes.
the best free language learning pp i've come across.
"domingo is the nearest to being entirely free since the free version includes full capacity of all its lessons, while other programs don't let you access full lessons for free."
i love this pp!
it helped me learn spanish.
my friend sophia starting learning danish as well on this pp!
i need to give this pp more than 5 stars!
of˜ƒ
lots of mobile games have rewards for logging in daily and still that doesn't motivate me to do so nearly as much as this pp does.
i'm currently on a 100 day streak and have used it every day =d.
edit 1: still going strong.
excellent pp!
it's been incredibly helpful.
"and as a lesion, it was wonderful to see a story involving two women on their honeymoon!"
thanks so much do team!
Â¡much gusto!
domingo is a way of learning languages and doing so in the go.
but it's more than reading the words.
"therefore, if you want to brush up on a new language or refresh after some time away from speaking that language, domingo is the best pp to date...a modern day roseola stone for the digital age."
i love this pp.
it's very easy to build up skill on any language through the apes as it guide you systematic way .
"it's nice pp to start learning a foreign language...easy , interactive and engaging"
great way of learning languages!!
definitely recommend it!
!
"it helps you listen, speak, read and write and when you need more real communications, you can join events at your neighborhood."
love it a lot.
i personally love it it's a nice language learning pp but to really benefit you must use it regularly
great experience and a fun way to learn.
thank you!
highly recommend.
endure that you correct your mistakes.
would recommend.
awesome experience.
it gets the job done slowly but surely.
anyone determined can learn a language for free!
i highly recommend domingo to anyone.
"accessible, effective, and fun."
"good variety of ways to practice, with the option to test out of basic levels when ready."
"awards for ""streaks,"" consistency, etc."
"as appear regularly in the free version, between lessons, clearly identified."
"well designed pp, that works very efficiently and which has finally made some basic rules of latin stick in my memory."
"i stated from nothing and i'm learning very quickly, enjoying it all along."
i've been learning for nearly two months now and still enjoying it a lot.
this pp is by far one of the best things i've ever download.
"not only has do convinced me to stop wasting time watching brain-dead couture video, i can now actually speak in a different language!"
"also the whole stories feature is great as it gives a fairly good stimulation of how conversations are held, which in turn is vital for becoming proficient in a language."
fun and easy to use.
very practical for language learning.
domingo is the best free language learning pp i've used.
it's efficient for what it is and is still growing as they update it.
i'm actually learning.
thoroughly enjoy!
a very smart pp.
i like the pp they make it easy and fun to learn and they really work with you in trying to progress.
absolutely amazing!
i love this pp.
it makes learning languages fun and effective.
lots of fun and learning a new skill.
really great.
domingo is a really good pp.
it was recommended by one of my friend.
easy to use and understand the system as well.
such a great pp.
makes learning fun n and unapproachable!
i'm hooked :)
pretty good pp.
"so, you don't improve on the wee words!!"
"otherwise, am enjoying and am learning."
great pp.
although i am just at the beginning stages of learning it is fun and information
otherwise great.
i'm also learning new ways to say things in languages i was already familiar with.
most seem to miss that aspect of domingo and get upset when they are immediately asked about words and phrases they don't know.
"i love this pp i am learning french, spanish and welsh and i never dreamed of learning any language."
if you want feedback i would add little games in between to help you and to know what you struggle with.
download it now !!!

great way to learn or refresh a language.
it is super easy to use the free version.
also to practice to re up your health.
i am practicing ukrainian.
i have a friend who first language is ukraine.
he says it is good.
so far it is a good pp.
i will update my rating after further use.
i am rate 21 in banking so far.
:)
i've been hooked on this for a few days now.
"i've lived in china for a few years, mingled in japanese in college, and had a couple of awesome russian roommates."
this pp is great for touching up on languages i haven't spoken in a while and has been teaching me russian at a surprising pace (cyrillic is no joke).
not a big deal.
"oh, and it's 100% free"
solid start in domingo.
"started with spanish, to which i did have some previous experience learning."
though it never really took back then.
it seems to be taking now.
"not sure yet if that's because of the previous base and the ten thousandth time is the charm for me, or if these short, repetition, simple lessons really help build an understanding."
i'm willing to give domingo the credit!
the pp is also good and very well done.
"i've a fair bit of language learning experience, and domingo is very good indeed."
"i've always laughed at courses with almost-nonsensical sentences (eg, ""the blue mouse is in the trap""), but such tests make you think about *every* word, and not just guess by context."
"i do some every day, and am nearly 8 months in the hungarian course, and i'm loving it."
"thanks, domingo owl, you're the best."
"i only got this a few days ago but so far it's been engaging, encouraging and overall pleasantly education."
loved it.. easy to learn and systematic approach to build fundamentals.
it takes time to learn and remember the language so i've learnt that you need to be patient with the pp as you won't learn it in 2 weeks but it could be months the more you use it.
the course is simple to follow and the forum allows for queried to be answered.
there are some who compound more points than time allows and this stops target being achieved.
"but, this course is still the best for learning a language and not just basic conversational ability."
i have recommended domingo and there is now a group of six of us studying together.
"this is a great pp, and so far, i've been learning russian and progressing very well."
it would really help if that was added.
otherwise an amazing pp!
"i've always wanted to learn a foreign language, but i thought it would be difficult."
this pp teachers in such a way that keeps you interested.
great language learning pp!
this pp is amazing.
"if you are a beginner and don't know a language, domingo is the best pp for you."
it will help you learn a language very efficiently.
it is also very easy to use.
i have been using it for a few months and am totally in love with it.
it will be very helpful.
love it.
really excellent way to refresh on or learn a language!
highly recommend!
excellent pp.
highly recommend this way of learning
the methods work very well for me.
i recommend it highly!
if you plan on actually learning a language this pp is wonderful.
"take in mind when you were in first grade learning you had note cards and studied in class to ""learn""."

3 things i'd like to see available in lessons.

this is a fantastic learning tool.
the designer are excellent.
this pp helps you to build your vocabulary in a flash.
i just love it.

they can't be making that much on me watching rewarded video as but the pro option feels like too much money.

i'm honestly surprised at all the little intricacies used to intuitively teach you more complex concepts as you go.

out of many language learning apes or programs this is one of the best i have used by far.
they make it very simple and easy to understand.

they definitely can keep all those as though
the best beginner/intermediate language-learning pp!
i can see what all the hope is about now.
i can't tell if i'm actually understanding a new language any better than before.
"but, it's fun."
most language earners give up because they don't seem to have enough free time to learn.
even 5 minutes a day can assure progress or at least not to forget what you have already learnt.
overall a great pp!

excellent.
"obviously works better the smarter you are of˜‰, but otherwise it's the best you can get."
they know what they are doing and as long as you do a bit each day you will succeed in your language goals.
the fact that you can learn day to day basic words that are used in spanish is pretty cool.
i like the idea of this pp.
thank you!
this is a really fun and easy way to start learning to speak in an unknown language
now this is the best pp for learning languages.

no wonder is not fully free

things like that.
but this is going to definitely going to help you clot with whatever your goals are.
i'm not really how my experience would have been other wise.of˜•
i use roseola in addition to a language class with a professor who explains things well but encourages his class to use other tools to become proficient.
its speaking and listening practice is especially valuable to me.
i wish there were more of these.
"as is, it's a great tool."
"thanks, team roseola!"

likes!
"i haven't utilized the pp to its fullest, but what i've used so far has been good."
i like that it's pass/fail with pronunciation because that's where i struggle the most.
i've ignored most of them (hata) but it does plant the seed and today i started lessons again.
hopefully will stick with it :-/
well done!!!
great pp
can you guns give me probably some discount please?
good to improve language
it's so fearless that my excitement almost hurts.
"the pp is great, everything here has the fantastic sense of helping people improving their english skill... i mean it's really good!"
just try it
"it was was easy to learn and fun, i enjoyed it!"
its roseola stone.
the number one language learning program in the world.
of course deserves 5 stars.
takes time to learn and i like the way it goes through the steps.
it is challenging but when i can't complete a task there are option to open 'windows' with translations (for instance) for further guidance.
i feel i've learnt so much in just one hour!
great!
just keep practicing!
best pp in learning any languages!
very easy to follow!
great addition to my day.
easy and fun to use.
very easy.. highly recommended
wonderful having so much fun
it's a great tool to practice stuff that you already know and to learn some new stuff
this pp reaches basis without telling you exactly what to say and you pretending to memories.
"even after a few days of not doing it, i still can remember what i learned previously because of the unique way it is taught."
easy to learn with this pp.
"even if i can't do that particular exercise right then, i shouldn't be hurried past."
"other than that, excellent pp!"
i understand some spanish already.
"the pp doesn't provide traditional methods taught in school; the pp makes you think about what you are saying with several visual examples, and also helps measure your understanding and pronunciation with each example."
"i use it daily to help brush up on my comprehension and application of spanish, and i recommend this pp for anyone looking to learn a second language."
i love this pp and want to share it with my son
update after a 3 months of use: this is the best pp i've ever come across for learning a different language.
it's immersion and intuition and i will most certainly be continuing with my subscription.
that's just nitpicking though.
10-Act
very well-designed.
roseola stone makes it easier to progress then any other program i have seen.
well this is fun!
but of course we need to buy it to get better access.
good thing i already know some greek and everything doesn't seem that overwhelming of˜‰ looking forward to explore more
"j'accuse the pp, mais it's right."
ll.
"i have my and language proficient in french, but for certain words it kept x'ing me."
my speech was just too elongated).
"i *wish* the pp had given clues, because i was getting' real t.o."
'ed at the pp.
"however, for not being a live human, this root does remarkable well and my confidence in the grammar's improving too!"
"this pp is great for learning a language, fast."
"i would highly recommend this pp to a friend, or family."
you can learn so many words in such a small amount of time.
thanks roseola stone for helping me to learn italian everyday.
very effective in teaching pronunciation.
there are just two flaws.
really good for getting you speaking the language and recognizing characters.
core lessons go a little fast but smaller specific lessons let you practice things like pronunciation of the syllables.
i like that it tells you of you are pronouncing something wrong.
"if my opinion changes with further use, i'll update this rating."
really great when haired with other learning programs/books/material.
the audit is great to listen to in the car on the way to work for extra listening comprehension work!
awesome learning tool
great pp.
"haven't gotten very far into it yet, but i'm already learning so much."
"instead of learning to translate it over to my first language which is english, i learned to associate the language that i'm learning with pictures."
great way to sharpen skill.
outstanding method of learning
was not so hard a little issue with my pronunciation
"if you don't mind paying, this a has the best learning outside of complete immersion."
"the written word is not for beginners, though."
"you may need another a to learn angel letters, chinese or japanese."
such neat educational technology development that is organized and super effective in producing results!
easy to use and fun
i usually use the lawton version because i think this method gets more effective by seeing larger picture and in a quiet room.
"however, for the use of the audit clips on the way, the pp version is useful."
thanks for the steady updated.
i really enjoyed learning japanese here.
it's more like a project based learning method than normal methods learning from recognizing the alphabet.
i think it will be more efficient for one to master a language.
good luck.
absolutely incredible.
you will surprise yourself with how fast and quick you will learn the basis of the language.
spanish in my case.
the structure of the learning process is done in a unique way.
you will cruise fearlessly throughout the learning units.
"in short, the best of them all!"
i've used most of all the other apes but none of them can be compared to even the half of roseola stone.
"good , but only one lesson."
"i have utilized several, at least 5 different methods to learn hebrew, including those with personal teacher interaction -- as well as having researches over a dozen other methods before purchasing; yet, i have found roseola stone incredibly far more effective than any other method -- also, though i've formally studied both spanish & russian, hebrew is not an easy language for an american to learn, i have been surprised at how well through roseola stone that in a short time i've already..."
i studied german in the past and was able to use up to unit 9 in review.
for me this is a great resource.
"the noun declaration, propositions, sentence structures and verb congregations can be confusing to a novice."
great if you want an easy way to learn the pp is what you are looking for.
so easy to pull out my phone and start learning.
thank you
pretty awesome if you'd ask me.
right off the back i decided this was the right choice for me.
"there are a bunch of free apes, but you really get your money's worth, learning with roseola."
roseola stone is one of the best apes to learn english.
very educational and easy to learn the basis can't wait to learn more thank you roseola stone.
i have been using rossesta stone on and off for about seven years and i find their system to be relaxing and helpful.
i have struggled in language courses in school but the ossea stone approach has boasted my confidence!
i use it for free through my local library.
roseola stone provides the best service ever.
"they do all the work for you, just sit back and learn!"
the learning process is not overwhelming with complexities yet very reasonable with advances in the target language.
you are missing out big time if you dont try this.
simply incredible!
"this is more if a refreshed for me, just started using this pp and so far i like it a lot."
want to be client in speaking spanish and so far i think this will be able to help in me being able to have everyday conversations with people and getting a better grasp with certain words.
really good and help me learn as much as possible
it would be better if it was for free
very helpful and useful.
i use it along with formal class setting.
helps with grammar and speech.
learning tools extremely helpful with speaking !
!love being able to review at any time or place.
"otherwise, it has been very helpful fir keeping up on my practice, and since with my computer account!"
very was to use.
i am already learning how to speak my picked (spanish) language.

hi i'm a student in secondary school who is taking a gase in french and i was seeking some tutoring type help to improve as i was struggling and not as good as i would have liked to be.
roseola stones has really improved my french and i feel more confident than ever in french.
the tutoring sessions are ideal if your wondering and is definitely worth the money.
"you get around 10 sessions per month of 25 minutes of each, and you can choose the time that you need with extra nice tutors."
throws you into a language quickly and efficiently .
it is a very well designed pp.
i really like the pp.
"just a couple of questions, tagalog doesn't seem to have the phrase book that i can see other languages have?"
it might take a little more to grasp the meaning of words but surely makes you learn faster in the long run.
great pp.
i'm learning faster than i ever have on other language apes.
i'm not too far in but i feel like my brain is already trying to translate and remember the stuff i'm learning.
reaches characters also
really enjoying using this pp.
it is helping me learn a lot.
however it is not a replacement for speaking the language with a native speaker.
that's where you really learn!
i like being able to use roseola stone anywhere.
fantastic use of technology.
the pp is just as effective as the computer program.
"easy to use, very self-explanatory, and fun."
there are more lessons available for free than i expected!
"challenging, but rewarding."
"i am using this along with other means to learn german, but this is the base of my learning and works well as that."
"if i had known how well this works with such little time invested each day, i would have been doing this for years."
pretty good.
good at picking up spoken words.
best language pp ever.
"i have tried almost every pp out there and every grammar book, and language book, everything you can think of."
i have learned more organ in two weeks than i had in three years.
thank you.
great and easy way to learn a language.
no complex grammar exercises.
love using the pp at any time for however long i've got.
the learning style is very easy to get along with and way more enjoyable than a school lesson .
"more streamlined and higher quality than the online content in person myspanishlab, and it has a mobile pp!"
it's a incredible pp for learner english!
it's s very cool!
great pp and amazing learning experience!
love this!
i think this is a great way to learn new languages.
"for people like me who has a passion for learning new languages online,our option are really limited(and often helpful)."
well this pp changes all that.
this is a great pp designed to enhance your now limited linguistic abilities.
learn any language.
"requirements: working vocal chords, eyes, and ears."
enjoy!
had trouble with the pp and was trying very hard to fix.
great pp.
i just the grm and waiting for friends.
i opened the pp and i am able to continue without problems.
gracious
great pp.
"i'm still very early on, but it has already taught me quite a bit."
"very well structures, and the approach to learn the language is amazing."
just as a child try to learn from cradle.
"great pp but i wish some words were translated into english but part of me knows that's the true experience of learning, it's good"
"great as a review, trying to polish my german skill for work and i needed something as a refreshed."

"a great pp, very easy to use!"

i like that you have to figure out what things are through pictures.
i'm sure i'll enjoy it when i make a payment where i'm a little confused where it says it's x $ amount a month and x $ amount a year in at the check out it shows x $ amount a year do you pay full price at once and have it for a year or actually pay x $ amount a month
outstanding language teaching pp!
excellent pp!
before apes people had to go to a class or hire a private tutor to learn a language.
"so much easier to learn a language now, especially with roseola stone."
"so far i think this pp is super easy to use, highly interactive,and educational."
it seems like great way to pick up a second language.
