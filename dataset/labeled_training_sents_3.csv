its good but it moves at a very slow pace.,1,
it's not challenging enough.,1,
it keeps reinforcing basic vocabulary using baby sentences while occasionaly adding new words.,1,
"it's also alot of multiple choice which helps you choose the right answer by ellimimating the obvious wrong answers, which makes it too easy and doesnt help me learn.",1,
they need less multiple choice and more speaking without words on screen.,1,
that would make it more challenging and more like learning a language in the real world.,0,
some languages are designed well - japanese.,2,
"others, like korean, seem to have been designed by a teenager only interested in talking about boy bands/ girl bands... seriously, skip all logical vocabulary and into sentences and go straight into ""that singer is not cool. """,1,
please redesign korean so it makes sense.,1,
streamlined interface.,0,
addictive features.,0,
"learning chinese, i enjoy the incremental vocabulary and systematic sentences.",2,
"i'm disappointed that we must learn the sounds of characters before their meanings, which often inspire their shape.",1,
i'm also ambivalent that one can get perfect scores with very sloppy studying.,0,
this app works fine without having the adds removed.,2,
they're more options online which is convenient if you have the time.,0,
"i am using it for japanese and i have only found one translation errors ""excuse me, i am an apple.""",0,
unless that's a popular saying in japan?,0,
i wish they added a voice recognition to practice saying the words/symbols/ and sentences.,1,
other then that i work on it two hours a day and repeat a lot of the lessons and i think it's great ðŸ˜Š,0,
duolingo is a great app to learn languages but it is not complete so you don't find every language you are looking for.,0,
"also the listening exercises don't work after the last update and i don't hear anything, please fix this problem.",1,
otherwise it is really great and if didn't have these issues i would give a five star.,0,
i pay and subscribe so that tells you quite a lot.,0,
"however, after an (old) update, provided comments, but received no response from developers, i am a little disappointed with their customer engagement.",1,
"... ... old comment : ""i can no longer see how many words i've learnt this month, (and the previous month's either) also, where are the little graphs of progress etc ""what were you thinking""?",1,
"...... please bring back those features""",0,
"it would be more, realistic if they allowed month to month memberships.",1,
i dislike the all or nothing feeling.,0,
"it irks me that the ads claim to be to help everyone learn for free, yet they don't have a pay plan for those of us who are on fixed incomes, and are striving to change that.",1,
newsflash duolingo... not everyone who uses this app is so wealthy they can afford to give you a year up front...& not everyone who uses this app is so dirt poor that free is the only answer.,1,
get flexible please.,0,
it keeps putting me in offline mode.,1,
my internet and data both work fine.,0,
and everytime i finish a lesson it changes what level i'm on.,0,
i got to level four and then it took me back to level three so i finished a part of level three and it reset me back to the beginning of level three again?,1,
i'm making no progress.,0,
"i would give you 5 stars but the environment you designed for ios is better that the one for android, if you improve the android one maybe, maybe i would give you the 5 stars and pay the plus subscription.",1,
"update: as soon as i wrote the previous comment the app changed to an ios like environment, don't know how, i didn't download an update and i don't let the device do it on its own!",0,
"so... very strange, right?",0,
now i am taking down another star because the speaking exercises are annoying.,1,
great app.,0,
i am learning german.,0,
edit : i am having issues with my app recently.,0,
my internet connection is perfectly fine yet it's failing to connect to the internet.,1,
everything was good until a couple of days ago before i updated the app to the latest version.,0,
the hearts (that you use to practice) don't continue to recharge unless you open the app again.,1,
left app alone for 13 hours thinking i would have almost 3 hearts to practice with but i only had one.,0,
clicked the hearts to see the timer... started counting down 5 hours.. please fix the refill period of the hearts.,1,
"i've used this app before and it was pretty good, but i got a new phone and had to redownload the app.",0,
i kept trying to log back in using my email but it kept saying there was an error.,1,
tried downloading it again and it's still not working.,0,
i will give it 3 stars because i learned basics of german just in 2 days but now the sounds in the listening exercises aren't coming so i have to skip it moreover earlier when i pressed any word it used to pronounce it for me which helped a lot but it has stopped i don't know why it happened but plz help me i really like this app .,1,
"the audio in listening excercises is not working, also when selecting an answsr it doesnt read it, while the sound when u answer correctly can be heared.",1,
i have the app and the issue is not solved in the latest update.,0,
so many duplicate answers while learning japanese while only one of them is good.,1,
makes it impossible to go through many lessons as you are faced with 1/2 chances of loosing a heart everytime you come by such questions.,1,
my review is for the mobile version alone.,0,
it is conceptually good and can teach the basics at the very least.,0,
"however, it falls short on several points: 1. the tips doesn't cover what is in the skill.",1,
"furthermore, the tips aren't show at the beginning.",1,
"to fix this, it is suggested to give the tips at the first level and lesson of each skill.",1,
the bell button should be for reviews.,1,
"2. the league leaderboard may not be synchronised, i had more xp gained in that day but others are ranked higher.",1,
please add the ability to use the keyboard to do the exercises.,1,
"forcing me to use word banks means i don't learn anything, and subsequently, repeatedly uninstall the app and use the desktop version instead.",1,
when i first started i was learning but as things got tougher i started struggling to understand why certain phrases are used and why.,0,
then i'd use all my stars trying to figure things out i'd get discouraged finally i just quit playing.,1,
if this app had some short tutorial videos it would help.,1,
when you're struggling to learn and it shows you're competing against other people you dont know and you drop 10-15 places it kills the moral of learning .,0,
the app just wasn't what i was hoping for.,0,
this app would have been awarded 5 stars had it given the learner a way to connect and communicate with other learners more efficiently.,1,
"when i googled a way to speak to a fellow japanese student, the answer presented by duolingo was ""you can, however, click on someone's name/icon to go to their profile (or ""stream"" as duolingo calls it) and post a message to them there.""",0,
this statement is false.,0,
please provide gratification to those of us wanting to communicate.,1,
this app is very good and i realy enjoy it but i dont know why i have no audio and cant hear anything.,1,
this makes me disappointed in learning foreing languege.,0,
"ok so this app is really nice and i like that it teaches you stuff for free, but ever since they put that ""you only have 5 hearts"" thing it's not enjoyable anymore, i'm learning russian and it's really hard for me to make no mistakes i would rate full stars but the heart thing is ridiculous, oh and you have to wait hours to get your hearts back, but besides all of that, it's really helpful would recommend",1,
so far so good with the learning.,0,
i understand that the free version will serve me ads and i'm quite happy to see them.,0,
what i don't like is how the app is clearly accessing data from other apps on my phone to serve me ads (e.g.,1,
product search history from shopping apps).,0,
that is super creepy.,0,
"additionally, the app frequently resets during a lesson and you lose all your work and have to start the lesson over.",1,
i truly like this app.. but i dont know wut has happened that i cant listen to the audios!,1,
which makes it aweful!,0,
i wish u guys could fix it!,0,
"i have a problem with this app, recently i have audio problems in app it doesnt work for many lessons.",1,
"also after the latest update there are new problems, solve them please",1,
"for japanese, duolingo needs work.",1,
"sometimes i get kanji i've never seen before, not spelled out.",1,
i only figure it out by elimination.,0,
"after introducing ""refreshing"" courses, i find that most of my limited time i spend on the app is used retreading the same categories over and over, plateauing my progress.",0,
"lastly, for japanese, social context is important.",1,
"it teaches that ""domo"" is an acceptable way to say thanks, but it's only for informal cases, and would be considered rude if used casually",1,
"not bad, but i prefer to use a computer.",0,
mainly because i cannot see my assignments to gage how much i have left to do for my weekly german homework.,0,
i hope they implement an assignment tab soon.,1,
this app was absolutely amazing when i first started it.,0,
the update where you only need 5 lessons to get to the next level has seriously messed up the whole experience.,1,
"i'm the type of person to need those extra lessons because without them, i won't know when i should move on and i get lost.",0,
"it discouraged me so much, and i haven't touched the app in weeks.",0,
i'm seriously hoping they change it back.,0,
"the more they update, it just makes it feel like some kind of game to be plowed through.",2,
i love this app.,0,
it's easy to pick up and work on in short bursts.,2,
i wish it didn't drain my battery so fast.,1,
"edit (11/7): i just learned that the grammar tips and whatnot are only available on the web version, save for the few languages the added to in the last update.",1,
i'm using the app to learn japanese and irish.,0,
i couldn't understand the grammar rules for irish.,0,
thankfully someone in the comments posted it.,0,
that's really disappointing.,0,
love the app because it's easy to use in my busy life.,0,
"i like this app however, i don't know if it was helpful at teaching me basics like numbers and how to conjugate a verb.",0,
"my biggest issue (i'm learning spanish) is often you are asked to type what you hear, i've ran into the problem where the app says ""un"" but it is supposed to be ""una"" and i get dinged for it.",1,
the only thing that bugs me for a while is that i cannot access the lecture notes in the app itsself.,1,
i can access them on the website version of duolingo.,0,
it would be very nice to add them on the app aswell.,0,
it makes it very hard to study without them.,0,
dark mode would be much appreciated aswell.,1,
white on white makes me blind after a while...,1,
"for a free platform, it's not bad.",0,
"but, the phrases used (spanish) to teach the language are weird, and sometimes just unnatural.",1,
"also, don't like the leagues, it makes it more about racking up points instead of learning the language.",1,
"i'm a big fan of duo, but (re)introducing the health system in the app makes me totally disappointed (and the app unusable, imo).",1,
i was using the app both on ios and android an i have to say that being punished for my mistakes in the ios app made me uncomfortable all the time.,0,
so i learned using the android app but today the hearts appeared in the android version also.,1,
now i'm really thinking to delete the app!,0,
could you pls tell me what are your intensions with this health/hearts system?,0,
the free version of this app now gives you a limit of 5 mistakes.,1,
"after that you either can complete practice rounds to regain ""health"" or buy them with points.",0,
very annoying.,0,
"also, most aspects of the language grammar are not explained.",0,
this app is easy to use and helps with memorization.,0,
and you can turn off the speaking and listening features.,0,
duolingo has come a long way and is a very fun to use app for learning.,2,
"but, there is a constant bug causing the sound files to not load properly, resulting in silent lessons that punish you for not being able to hear the language.",1,
"this makes failure impossible to avoid when you are supposed to translate what you hear, and you can't even hear anything.",0,
this makes you fail lessons and interrupt the otherwise enjoyable learning experience in an annoying way.,0,
a 5 star app without this issue.,0,
this app has bugs that do not allow you to click on the correct response.,0,
it has happened to me more than a dozen times and i've reported it each time.,0,
"for months, these errors have not been fixed.",0,
"because of this, you cannot finish a lesson, or level, and must abort the whole thing.",0,
this happens primarily on the more complex lessons.,0,
most of the app is just fine.,0,
"the smug, patronising, unskippable ""here's a tip"" screens make me want to throw my phone out of the window.",1,
i tried it seems many people love this app.,0,
maybe it's just me,0,
"and when i've blown a lesson, i'd hope to get remedial on that topic, rather than being quizzed on basic vocab; after 75 days and over 75 hours i can generally get cat, dog and monkey correct, but i never really get irregular verbs.",0,
"i may try again sometime, by which time it will be from the very beginning, but while i'd love to learn more i can't devote multi hours daily.",0,
"some courses are good, like japanese and chinese, while some others are horrible, like korean.",1,
overall it's very hit or miss.,0,
yeah it's money grabby with it's pricy subscriptions yeah it's got false promises and yeah they ask for ur money before u even start learning a language...but u are learning a language for free.,0,
you will at least remember something.,0,
this is the best app but for some reason after the updates the sound doesn't work.,1,
please return the sound ðŸ™,0,
meh.,0,
what vocabulary is there is not incredibly useful.,0,
it is also quite limited and overly repetitive.,1,
there is little to no actual instruction on grammatical rules so you kind of have to guess and hope for the best.,1,
"i would buy this if i were convinced the lessons contained actual instruction, but i am not convinced they do.",0,
"i am having trouble with letters 3. it has a hiccup and will not acknowledge ""t"" answer even though there are no other options on the matching of letter and symbol.",0,
i can't go any further with the program.,0,
for days it gets to that and stops.,0,
is there a programming problem.,0,
i used domingo for hindi before and the problem did not exist.,0,
help!,0,
i'm learning korean and refreshing my french.,0,
"if i was only doing french i would give the app 4 or 5 stars, but the korean course is lacking.",1,
in french the lessons build slowly and helpful hints.,2,
"however, korean is not so.",0,
i have to use outside sources to learn about the words.,0,
the lessons don't make sense and there has been zero explanation of honorifics and choosing between different translation options is impossible without outside help.,0,
it's been very frustrating.,0,
it's pretty good for a starting point.,0,
there are two major shortcomings though.,0,
the early lessons can sometimes use sentences so simple that it's impossible to drive the intended meaning.,1,
(wir laufen has 3 meanings depending on context).,0,
the second and most irritating issue is the quality of the audio.,1,
it's hard to hear exactly what is being said often due to how muddy the audio is.,1,
for example with german i heard (eine) very clearly even when using slow talk.,0,
it wanted einer,0,
"i love the browser version of duolingo, and i use it all the time.",2,
the app is just horrible.,0,
this is a learning tool not a game.,1,
there shouldn't be lives!,1,
"it's not even like the lives recharge quickly, no, it takes 5 hours!",1,
"if you loose all your lives, and you don't finish any lessons, that's it, your streak is done for, and you can't practice!",0,
"so i highly recommend the browser, but don't use the app.",1,
i have been using duolingo from the past 250 days.,0,
but now i lost interest in it because of it's new feature that allows you to go to the next checkpoint only when you have completed all the 4 levels of each chapter in the previous checkpoint.,1,
this is very annoying because sometimes i dont feel like repeating all the levels of the chapter because i feel i have learnt it enough and it was easier.,1,
everyone has a different capability to grasp.,0,
give flexibility to the user to move ahead!,1,
!,0,
disappointed that it's more like a game than lessons.,1,
hard to keep going if you make mistakes and run out of life and have to wait for more energy.,1,
once i got going wasn't hard to figure out how to gain more live.,2,
"however after a couple of weeks the app stopped working, not awarding health or points.ðŸ¤¨",1,
app works well and lots of options.,0,
one new feature that is more annoying is the breaking of previously completed skills at a rate that at my current learning goal results in only 1 new lesson every 2 days.,1,
"while i appreciate this to ensure retention it seems this should either take into account lesson goals per day, be optional or like lesson goals have a control for decay rate.",0,
this app would be rated higher by me but this feature greatly diminishes my learning potential based on my time.,0,
"so very tired of ""no health left"" penalty that locks the app when you get answer wrong.",1,
i listen to your ads ads faithfully to support you but you lock me out constantly.,1,
why??,0,
"you're trying to bribe me to buy ""health points""?????",0,
for the last 2 days you say i have 399 health points instead of the 450 needed to get unstuck because got the last question of the lesson wrong????,0,
really????,0,
this happened 3 times.,0,
whatever.....,0,
"good, fun learning format.",2,
it would be 5 stars if the voice recognition worked.,1,
sometimes it says i am not saying something right when i know i am.,0,
"like ""sin sal"".",0,
then it uses all my hearts and i cant practice until the hearts restore in a day.,1,
they need to make it so you dont lose a heart if they cant get the voice recognition to work properly.,1,
"good for beginners, not great for if you are trying to perfect a language you already know.",1,
"i have only been using the app fÃ¼r a couple days but i'm enjoying how it repeats lessons in fun and different ways, i don't like the adds on the free version but at this point i will put up with them until i decide otherwise.",2,
"this is the 3rd app i've tried and so far, by far the easiest to manoeuver.",0,
thanks,0,
hello!,0,
i really like the app and use it really frequently but i only have one issue after the remake.,0,
you can no longer see the xp under or next to each language which really helped me see which one i should practice first or more.,1,
please please please add the xp where you pick your languages.,1,
the app would have 5/5â˜† for me otherwise,0,
good app.,0,
"i just dont like the whole heart point thing, it really limits the whole learning process.",1,
"so the more incorrect answers you give, the less you can learn.",1,
"you should learn from your mistakes, not be punished for them...",1,
i've enjoyed using this app the past few weeks but i'm finding all the typing to be a real pita.,0,
i seriously doubt i'm going to last.,0,
if you want to spell spanish words and type all the time this would be a 5 star app.,0,
updated dec 21 the repetitive type on my phone is getting older by the minute.,0,
it's ok.. i cant afford the paid option so its a little annoying when my hearts /lives disappear into thin air which happens regularly,1, - especially when i've just used all of my gems to buy new ones or done practice sessions to earn them back.
ive come on today and only have 3 when i havent even done anything!,1,
"this is a glitch that needs sorting... not everyone can pay out for games, and i dont have an issue with ads.",1,
great app with poor hints and pronunciations.,1,
get this only to support learning another language,0,
"i love that it says learn for free, but you get about 5-10 minutes a day that's free",1,
"great learning app, but i hate that you lose an entire lesson when you're heart health runs out because of mistakes.",1,
it makes any lesson you get wrong even longer because you have to repeat it and it hurts you from getting points to be in the leader board.,1,
i think it's rude.,0,
its advertised as free yet isnt free because you run out of gems to buy hearts.,1,
if you're attempting to learn a new language you're going to make mistakes and lose hearts.,0,
if you run out of hearts and cant get more the progress is lost for that lesson and cant restart the lesson without hearts to get better at the language.,0,
pretty wack.,0,
"reducing to three starts, because: - the latest update has messed with my progress!",1,
"i had 5/15 done for many sections on level 4, but now they are complete; - for a few days duolingo appears to drain my phone's battery like hell!",1,
"it constantly appears in the list of apps that used the battery for the past n minutes, and the battery discharges two times faster than before.",1,
please!!,0,
improve the korean lessons.,1,
"there is no additional info, only tasks!",0,
"so it's just words memorization, not learning... nonsense (( (the french lessons are great!)",0,
could i get my gems back please?,0,
"i started a test and then it said ""an error occurred"" and i didn't get my 5 gems back... and that's the 5th time now.",1,
"so can you please fix that glitch so we can keep our gems if we don't do the test, and also can i get my gems back as well please!",0,
"otherwise, i love the app!",0,
fun but glitchy.,1,
"lost gems when i buy more hearts (does not replenish hearts, only takes gems), not gaining hearts at the given time frame.",1,
i have to close and re open app between levels or it crashes.,1,
too many push notifications.,1,
no obvious way to contact customer service in free version.,1,
i reinstalled hoping to solve these problems but still lost all my gems.,0,
there have been so many changes and they are not all good.,1,
the reviews prove this.,0,
are the developers even listening?,0,
"anywho, i have to take my tablet out of the keyboard case in order to type.",0,
the app will not work in landscape mode on a tablet.,1,
can this be fixed?,0,
it works if i go online.,0,
"this app continually tells me my answer is incorrect when it matches exactly with what the ""correct"" answer is.",0,
"when i went to the site, i saw hundreds of the same complaints.",0,
hundreds.,0,
frustrating!,0,
"overall i like the format, especially that it gets into verbs right away.",0,
"but -- even though i have the microphone permission on, the app won't let me do the recorded spoken exercises.",1,
"if that part worked, i'd give it 5 stars.",0,
its system of hearts discourages making mistakes when in reality everyone makes mistakes.,1,
"it is a good incentive to learn but at the same time, you often run out of hearts and can't resume learning a language.",1,
"if they just took out the hearts or gave us more every day, this app would have 5 stars.",0,
would have given it a five if you wouldnt have added the health aspect into it i think that is a huge drawback to this app i understand the benefits of the concept but you are already practicing as you go so why limit how much you can learn in a day by having to have health it makes no sense just makes it harder to go forward,1,
i find the explanations for usages if parts of speech helpful.,0,
"duolingo plus offers progress quizzes, but the content is dominated by vocabulary and grammar that hasn't been introduced.",1,
"also, there is not enough emphasis on spelling and speaking new words and phrases.",1,
it's good for the method of teaching but it lacks in explaining masculine/feminine and why a word is pluralized or singular.,1,
for example the word in the sentence is singular but the french word is plural.,1,
how would i even know the differences if it isn't pointed out?,0,
"if those important things are explained, i would give 5 stars",0,
huge downgrade over the years.,0,
"now this app is riddled with pointless notifications and ads, gamificafion knob cranked to 11. i get you want to make money but this is still mostly volunteer work.",1,
would be an amazing app but it takes too long to restore hearts so i'm getting nowhere.,1,
it says free trial but i click it and it wants me to pay for the year!,1,
gutted as my brother learnt arabic with it before the heart system was introduced.,0,
my biggest gripe with this app is the voice portion when learning vietnamese.,1,
"the pronounciations are too quick, and you don't get a chance to hear it well enough.",1,
"this would be 5 stars but there is a consistent issue where experience points ate not being applied when unlocking levels, the double experience point feature in the shop does not work some of the time as well.",0,
the old version was better.,0,
"i think you should remove the latest updates when it comes to wait for 3 or 4 hours just to get an heart so you can practice, but anyway it is a good app and helpful one",1,
it's an easy app to use.,0,
but the heart part of it is annoying.,1,
"after every lesson it shoves an add in your face and after that it asks you to buy duolingo, premium?",0,
"app is good, but be aware that the paid version is a 60$ a year subscription, -not- a pay 10$ once to unlock the no ads version.",1,
double check what you are paying for or get unpleasant surprise charges!,0,
it's so good!,0,
but the health thing is annoying.,1,
and the ads taking up to 30 seconds to finish is also annoying.,1,
"so, 3 stars",0,
it's not a bad language learning app.,0,
however i find that it relies too much on phrase learning and should not be a replacement for actual education in the language.,1,
"the app would get 6 stars if not for their new ""leagues.""",1,
"for those of us actually interested in learning, competing with people that are earning thousands of points a day is counterproductive.",1,
"besides, what person with a full - time job has time for more than a few lessons a day?",0,
"nice app anything free is going to be selling , unfortunately every time i get 1 wrong i am locked out for hours as i have no "" hearts "" i cannot afford to buy hearts but would like more of a chance to evolve",1,
i really like the duolingo method.,0,
unfortunately the app stopped working and i had to reinstall it.,0,
this erased all my progress and i had to take the placement test again.,0,
a wonderful learning tool.,0,
one of the best and most useful app for me.,0,
oh oh after an update the fonts are now too small to read on my mobile.,1,
the first few levels were cool.,0,
but the app does a poor job of adjusting if the learner (me) starts to struggle.,1,
i am enjoying using this app.,0,
"though, it is not saying the words to me, when i tap them.",1,
"so, its slowing my progress.",0,
"my girlfriend has hearts in hers and it's a clear cash grab, very disappointed in this app.",0,
"when i first got it there weren't even ads, this is unfortunate.",1,
it really helps and i love it the app is helping me learn spanis h.c but why the heck would you add a heart system i just want to learn different languages not make a couple mistakes and wait a day just to make the same mistakes and i keep making the same mistakes because i cant practice the goddang language.,1,
tldr good app get rid of heart ps i know its for microtransactions and you guys need your money but really 5 hearts,1,
"ok, one problem.",0,
i recently completed my 1st checkpoint on my spanish class on duolingo.,0,
"but when i try to tap the next level, it reloads, fix this, por favor i don't wanna lose my 6 day streak.",1,
ps: and my double gem wager.,0,
"sayounara, adios.",0,
it s a system need improving however it's very enjoyable and fun to learn with.,0,
encouraging and inspiring,0,
it is very good that the languages are taught for free....the only complain is that it takes alot of time to load,1,
the app is clunky.,0,
if you're rolling through the lessons then they show up in the order they are supposed to.,0,
"if you back out to the main menu and then click on a lesson, the wrong lesson comes up and you have to scroll through the lessons subfolders until you find the one you are looking for.",1,
this is a great app!,0,
the only thing i would add is the prunciation under the word.,1,
"for example, under the chinese symbol for eat, put chÄ«.",0,
"if i am missing that, i'm sorry.",0,
great app overall!,0,
i'm learning hebrew and i wish they would show the english version of what i'm learning because i have no idea what i'm really saying.,1,
a picture can tell many stories.,2,
i do like the fact they use pictures in their lessons.,2,
samsung galaxy s10.,0,
"the app so far is pretty good; however it keeps crashing, has required 2 restarts and it a little buggy on some of the screens.",1,
"too advanced, i don't recommend for beginners",1,
great app but not consumer friendly as far as pricing and payment goes.,1,
$200 is too much up front to unlock all of the units and i'm unwilling to pay monthly for something i'll never own.,1,
i would be much more willing to pay to unlock units as i progress.,1,
theres 20 units for spanish and i'd glady pay $10 to unlock each unit as i progress.,1,
that only seems logical.,0,
having problem putting new amazon prime purchase key into old learning app from trial.,1,
so far so good.,0,
hard to navigate at times,1,
great way to learn a language without going to a class.,0,
the two problems that i have are not having any explanation of what grammar i am learning and no way for me to gauge how well my pronunciation is.,1,
most of the time you can get the gist of what the program is trying to teach you but outside of word memorization i feel like i would get more out of having an explanation of the lesson before taking the practices,1,
the app is very helpful.,0,
however there are glitches i.e.,0,
when you try to pronounce a word sometimes the just doesn't hear it no matter how loud you are.,1,
that's major frustrating because its a major part of learning,0,
very buggy.,0,
worth getting though.,0,
"can you please fix the bug were it is not testing my speech, just going to the next picture.",1,
i wish i didn't need a computer to have the live sessions.,1,
"i can't use the totale version, when i'm not home.",1,
i hope they will change that.,0,
good and exciting when needed,0,
good to start basic vietnamese with lacking in learning layout should start with alphabet learning first then go onto grammar structure instead its reversed but overall it's good program,1,
"great app, but it's just too expensive.",1,
sometimes the learner needs to go back and review his/her items.,0,
but there is no back feature in this app.,1,
it really can help.,0,
"there are several very annoying bugs:  - periodically it starts ""continue automatically to next screen"" even when this option is turned off;  -  sometimes it does not recognize the voice;  - long loading time;  - after startup shows the random lesson in the unit to learn instead of the first to be done.",1,
the app is extremely frustrating when it comes to pronunciation.,1,
it says the word once and then just buzzes you if you say it wrong and wants you to try again without saying it to you again to help you get it right.,1,
also when they do one syllable at a time it is off.,0,
its a great app and is very usefull and helps with my pronunciations but it would have been better if you didnt have to pay for other lessons xx,0,
"it's ok, but some free apps are better",0,
its a good app but i mean it gives you a monthly pay but you actually have to pay the whole price for the term its verry irritating because i want to pay monthly.... due to the fact that i dont know how long it will take me to finish the course but i cant and i dont want to have to pay a 6 month subscription if im gonna finish in just 4 months or have to buy a 6 month and then not finish and have to buy the three month set only not to use the whole three month set,1,
much better on the computer version in my opinion.,1,
many of the buttons on mobile are difficult to press without mis-clicking such as the play button to hear something before selecting it.,1,
not a bad app but they where trying to make it like netflix getting that money all the time.,0,
make sure to cancel subscription otherwise itll keep billing you forever.,0,
its a nice app but only lets you go so far for free.,0,
"2 lessons and then you have to pay to go farther, otherwise i would give it a better rating!",1,
love it so far but i wish i knew exactly what i'm saying as i'm looking at the pictures.,1,
definitely having fun though!,2,
it does not start with alphabets or pronunciations.,1,
i just got thrown into random conversations.,1,
"sadly did not have the language i was looking to learn, but i can tell it is a very helpful and immersive program to learn a new language.",1,
so far it has been a very good app and i can see it would help me with beginner's french if it wasn't for the fact it costs so much!,0,
such a shame,0,
ok app.,0,
needs improvement in voice recognition.,1,
very expensive.,1,
up to know no problem but it will be hard to rember,0,
i can log in on the web via my school website but not the app.,1,
help me.,0,
use too much time to download of unit.,1,
it's so so right now.,0,
i'll be back later with an update,0,
sure wish it would stop assuming me to rate it when i have multiple times,0,
so far so good.,0,
will be in a better position to rate better after using the app for some time,0,
i did not like it only because it would start me off with spanish but i have never read or learned spanish before.,0,
pretty good wish it had vidoes with it,1,
i feel like it doesn't give you a more understanding of connect words.,0,
like (es=is) & (soy= i am).,0,
wish i could patch on my course i paid for all those so many years ago so i don't have to start at the the lui mangia beginning.,0,
this program very beautiful i wish more developed for the program,0,
i hate that you have to pay to get the full access,1,
