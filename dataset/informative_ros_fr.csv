rosettastone,1,125,"constantly states ""check your internet connection"" despite being connected g or wife."
rosettastone,1,125,won't download lessons in advance either.
rosettastone,1,125,paid for a 2 year subscription but can't even use it.
rosettastone,1,125,kept smiling support without response until they replied to tell me my goose fixed 2 isn't supported and to buy another phone!
rosettastone,1,125,do not give these thieves your money.
rosettastone,1,125,refund me!
rosettastone,1,0,they don't tell you the prices until after you make an account and give them your email address.
rosettastone,1,0,$94.99 for 12 months.
rosettastone,1,17,i have asked for support so many times and they tell me the same thing that never works!
rosettastone,1,17,"i was gifted a 2 or subscription, it worked for a few months on my telephone, then waiting for the pp to approve my voice it just stalked!"
rosettastone,1,198,"but i have a huge complaint about this software: when you pay to add a second language, it doesn't work!"
rosettastone,1,198,"i just gave goose play 200 dollars for a ""lifetime subscription"" and the pp says i can't access the material, or even attempt to purchase it again, because ""error: material was purchased with a different account."""
rosettastone,1,198,"neither goose nor is wants to refund me the money, so i wasted 200 dollars for inaccessible content."
rosettastone,1,198,please fix this error.
rosettastone,1,214,i only subscribed because i reasonably assumed that office support means that i can download lessons and use them on my commune to work.
rosettastone,1,214,"it doesn't, the application will only open, and the lessons will only load while you are connected to the internet."
rosettastone,1,214,"even if you've download a full unit or reloaded a lesson, moving to the next section will fail once you lose your signal."
rosettastone,1,1,"it is not possible, to use them on two different phone in the same time."
rosettastone,1,1,so i tried the motivation with another account.
rosettastone,1,1,the whole page seems not to work.
rosettastone,1,1,"after clinking on motivation, it is shows processing... and nothing happens fix it, or give me my money back the help chat does also not work, it directs you to email support.... seems to be a really low quality service!!!"
rosettastone,1,1,i wish i would have bought domingo or babel better :-(
rosettastone,1,60,"the pp is good, but unfortunately today the program started to pitch."
rosettastone,1,60,it's no longer hearing my answers on the speaking exercises.
rosettastone,1,60,the voice recognition is crashing.
rosettastone,1,60,"also when you tap to move to the next lesson or unit, it brought you back to the last lesson or to the next one."
rosettastone,1,1,i wanted a subscription after loving the domo.
rosettastone,1,11,"nothing but frustration, lack of help or translation, really poor audit/mid system, spend your money on a person, not this waste of time."
rosettastone,1,11,no sense of achievement due to constant pp errors forcing you to retro that which you failed 100% the first time.
rosettastone,1,2,"since the update, the pp asks for a curl login code."
rosettastone,1,2,i told the company this but they just ignored me.
rosettastone,1,231,that cost me Â£3.80.
rosettastone,1,231,"save your money try domingo, no customer service but no charges."
rosettastone,1,4,it is more expensive than it is worth i would rather have just got babel but sadly now i don't have a choice.
rosettastone,1,7,i'll chance it with couture in order to become client in the language that i am pursuing.
rosettastone,1,3,they also do not teach you the english translations... example: image shows two boys doing an activity.
rosettastone,1,3,all of which are only in japanese.
rosettastone,1,1,"it sometimes works fine, but more often it stumbled."
rosettastone,1,1,not interested in continuing if it's just going to act up.
rosettastone,1,1,"after they charged me again for another $50,i still can't use it again."
rosettastone,1,2,"after the update, i am no longer able to log in and i have changed my password to gain access and am still unable to log in."
rosettastone,1,10,"all paid content, you can't get any genuine learning without paying."
rosettastone,1,10,really disappointing that it was misleading in the avert which never seemed to mention the paywall.
rosettastone,1,6,"this pp isn't engaging enough, i found it boring and slow and it didn't teach me anything."
rosettastone,1,5,pp keeps telling me sign-in failed.
rosettastone,1,5,something went wrong.
rosettastone,1,5,"when i attempted to contact support, chat doesn work either."
rosettastone,1,1,it doesn't even teach you the alphabet.
rosettastone,1,1,they just give you pictures and sentences written in arabic.
rosettastone,1,1,"no idea which word is the noon, profound, adjective or verb/adler!"
rosettastone,1,2,why in your right mind would you try to go your own way with criterion on password?
rosettastone,1,1,i can't even log in.
rosettastone,1,1,give tried multiple times and it keeps saying something went wrong
rosettastone,1,1,the costume relation never answer my email for asking restore all purchase.
rosettastone,1,0,"i've asked for a refund several times, and the answer is to ask for goose play, but goose is pushing each other to contact lotion."
rosettastone,1,0,i will not use the director.
rosettastone,1,2,"application tried to remove money from my account without my knowledge, she wanted to pay 3 months of english even though i didn't even log in to create a profile on that application, so i do not recommend this application, beware of fraud"
rosettastone,1,1,pp is not opening i tried it on my phone as well as on my friend's phone but its not opening.
rosettastone,1,2,"check the price, don't purchase lessons via pp."
rosettastone,1,2,"look online first, it appears the sale prices don't translate to in pp prices."
rosettastone,1,1,"can't see the pictures, navigation not intuition."
rosettastone,1,24,"basically just an advertisement, and i don't have 50+ dollars to pay for the full version."
rosettastone,1,24,"go ahead and buy this if you have the money, it's a great pp, but if you thought it was free you are sadly mistaken."
rosettastone,1,0,same thing: only works while online.
rosettastone,1,10,"can only access one lesson, the rest you have to purchase."
rosettastone,1,10,"so after using it for one day, you cannot go on even with small or partial lessons."
rosettastone,1,8,progress....did one lesson and now i have to buy more to clock?
rosettastone,1,8,how is it linked to the one i already bought but not enough that i can use it on the pp more than 1 lesson worth?
rosettastone,1,21,"i chose the lowest level course it has, but not not only did it start teaching me words from the beginning, those words were mainly written in anti, which i barely know anything about."
rosettastone,1,21,and it didn even give a translation either!
rosettastone,1,21,how the hell am i supposed to figure out what the words that i can read with just pictures?
rosettastone,1,0,terrible.
rosettastone,1,0,my first lesson in japanese and it just rattled off entire sentences and asked me to pick the watching picture.
rosettastone,1,2,not working at all.
rosettastone,1,2,teach support hasn't responded either.
rosettastone,1,7,they make you repeat and guess phrases but with no context of what it means or what your saying.
rosettastone,1,28,the application says that the auto renewal is exercised by default.
rosettastone,1,28,unfortunately i tried to find this option but it doesn't exist!!
rosettastone,1,28,by the way i was paying through papal and i was charged anyway.
rosettastone,1,28,i don't know if the us friends face the same issue but here in e it's a mess.
rosettastone,1,1,i bought the subscription without realizing i was working through the free section in unit 1. so i was paying for something that was free.
rosettastone,1,208,their teach support has no idea why or how to fix the bug.
rosettastone,1,208,do not waste your money or time with this mobile andros pp.
rosettastone,1,16,the program has the student repeat a russian word or phrase and gives only a picture for the description.
rosettastone,1,16,"even if you can repeat the word or phrase, you dont know what it means."
rosettastone,1,0,my free trial days are going to finish..
rosettastone,1,1,yes it shows you how to say and speak it but it doesn't actually put the english in their to know what you're actually learning?
rosettastone,1,111,"when going over the pronunciation exercises, the pp does not hear me."
rosettastone,1,111,"when i say it louder, it says that the audit too loud."
rosettastone,1,111,"i paid for a lifetime membership yesterday, bit in really not pleased."
rosettastone,1,111,i want a refund........ i was able to troubleshoot the error.
rosettastone,1,111,"in willing to change my rating, i just have one question; since i have a lifetime membership, am i able to change the language i want to learn after i finish the whole lesson plan?"
rosettastone,1,39,i am a native chinese speaker and in september 2018 i bought the makarin version for my middle school aged daughter.
rosettastone,1,39,there was no explanation of grammar or rules at all.
rosettastone,1,6,you can't get a refund after 24 hours even though it's a 3 day trial.
rosettastone,1,6,"very first round is a picture of a boy and girl, both signaling hello and look to be both traveling with russian words on top and no english definition of what you're even saying."
rosettastone,1,6,i need to know the alphabet and letter pronunciation before anything.
rosettastone,1,271,"i often for the free trial, and they immediately charged my card $49."
rosettastone,1,271,i immediately canceled the subscription but did not get a refund!!
rosettastone,1,271,instead they will cancel it in december and keep my money!!
rosettastone,1,0,i get not using english but so far is has taught me nothing but random words with no real in-depth learning of the grammar.
rosettastone,1,0,i read the genetic reply but when people are telling you it's not working you should take that advice and alter the program.
rosettastone,1,4,"i'd hoped i could stream the languages i've paid for but no, i'd need to pay all over again."
rosettastone,1,30,"paid full price to have full access to the language learning lessons, but the subscription was not added to my account and i received error messages when trying to use the software."
rosettastone,1,30,i sent six email to the customer support and only received one reply asking for proof of purchase.
rosettastone,1,30,the customer support is terrible.
rosettastone,1,2,"does not support that in any capacity, neither learning or as interface language, so yeah, bought for that step daughter.... and she can't use it because its all in english, which she is trying to learn, and you can't change the interface language in the pp, you have to go to the webster to change it... get it together r.s."
rosettastone,1,2,must service was nice when i was concealing.
rosettastone,1,1,i recently purchased the life time subscription and it quits saying that my email is already in use.
rosettastone,1,1,can i get a refund?
rosettastone,1,4,"it says ""your payment is pending and you will clock this in a few minutes."""
rosettastone,1,4,not only have i paid for nothing but i also no longer have an option to update.
rosettastone,1,30,i tried speaking into it but it never registers my audit.
rosettastone,1,30,at that point i just disabled it so i can get through the first course but it defeats the purpose.
rosettastone,1,0,i can be sitting in complete silence and it still doesn always pick up my voice.
rosettastone,1,3,does not pick up my microphone.
rosettastone,1,3,i know it's not my phone because i'm using speech to text to write this review
rosettastone,1,1,the pp doesn't hear anything it freeze constantly and i spent over 200$.
rosettastone,1,1,this was ridiculous i subscribed from their email listing like 3 times and still got email.
rosettastone,1,1,i tried to delete my account but i can find the option on the pp and i can find it through their webster.
rosettastone,1,14,"not a great way to learn, i can pronounce the words, but i have known idea what i'm saying, as all you get is a picture."
rosettastone,1,14,"it's very repetition, so you'll learn how to say the words, problem is, you wont know what you are saying."
rosettastone,1,8,edit: latest version introduces display error.
rosettastone,1,8,in overview it shows me that there are 33 lessons per unit.
rosettastone,1,8,(but i'm the unit bottom it says 32 out of 32) please add dark mode.
rosettastone,1,4,so here i am paying for a non-existing device with hardly any valid reaction from customer service.
rosettastone,1,35,now they charged me again without giving me access to the material.
rosettastone,1,35,i believe there is a big bug in their transaction system.
rosettastone,1,2,i was enjoying this pp but have been charged Â£49 this month instead of Â£4.90!
rosettastone,1,2,have sent 2 email with no response to either.
rosettastone,1,2,"i've been waiting for a refund of my money for almost 2 days, the pp wasn't what i expected, including by the fact that they retired all the money in my bank account for the annual subscription."
rosettastone,1,23,with regards to the pp the voice recognition does not work.
rosettastone,1,23,you can make up any sounds and it says correct .
rosettastone,1,1,doesn't work in china and support was responsive.
rosettastone,1,6,you have to sound things out but it doesn't even pick up my voice.
rosettastone,1,6,when i'm doing it isn't noisy in my house so it should be able to pick up on my voice.
rosettastone,1,3,great pp but way too expensive.
rosettastone,1,3,i would definitely use it but the subscription is over prices and life time option sounds like a joke.
rosettastone,1,1,"unbearable buggy, slow pp"
rosettastone,1,3,can't get them to repeat phrase and won't recognize my voice!!
rosettastone,1,0,"it's pretty expensive for me, make it free, put some adds, i'll never complain about it."
rosettastone,1,1,save your $$ and use a different system.
rosettastone,1,0,pp keeps stating that my name or password are incorrect after resecting my password twice.
rosettastone,1,0,way too expensive... and misleading 10Â£ per month you can't do that.
rosettastone,1,0,with those prices you wont go far....
rosettastone,1,0,pp wont open.
rosettastone,1,0,can learn italian if the pp doesn open.
rosettastone,1,0,don't working with palmar login
rosettastone,1,0,"when doing activities in certain units the activity has nothing in common with the unit, i can believe how much of a scar this is"
rosettastone,1,0,the phone version of your product seems to only offer five of the languages in only interested in learning japanese.
rosettastone,1,0,i learn one and then when i am about to start the next one i forget what the last one was and so i would go to the last one again and again and again.
rosettastone,1,0,"oh, unless you want to pay money."
rosettastone,1,0,but the pp won't let me log in?
rosettastone,1,0,so i can only practice when i'm at home on my computer when i have time
rosettastone,1,2,the pp contains pop up asking you to give it a rating.
rosettastone,1,2,any pp with a pop up asking for a rating receive s a one star from me.
rosettastone,1,0,no active writing is possible when learning turkish... but that is the most important task!
rosettastone,1,1,"very slow support, no other option the waiting for email available."
rosettastone,1,1,chat does not work.
rosettastone,1,1,"compared to other programs, it's not for total beginners in my opinion."
rosettastone,1,1,and wrong!
rosettastone,1,0,and this is the beginners level?!
rosettastone,1,0,so how is the cracked can i choose the correct image to a word that i haven't the clue to it's meaning?
rosettastone,1,0,"the course was not a beginner course, in my opinion, as i requested."
rosettastone,1,0,"the words and short phrases were beyond beginner level, in my opinion."
rosettastone,1,0,and i guess my andros microphone was not suited to the pronunciation protocol of the roseola stone course.
rosettastone,1,0,"this pp is terrible for beginners learning organ , as a beginner you can not read very fast and the pp consistently asks you to repeat large phrases quickly."
rosettastone,1,0,"i would suggest at the very least an option to work at a slower pace, however i am ensure how that will affect your immersion qualities."
rosettastone,1,0,"turns out i still can't even login or create an account because it complains about my internet connection, when my signal is perfect."
rosettastone,1,1,one star for not being honest about purchases!!
rosettastone,1,0,"i liked this pp, its really useful for learning languages and i would love to rate it for 5 stars but all the time i need to sign in and it takes a long time for it cut all the time i'm getting ratification ""something went wrong""."
rosettastone,1,0,pp installed but takes too long to load.
rosettastone,1,0,the pp is currently trying to teach me chinese by only speaking and and showing translations in chinese.
rosettastone,1,0,not sure how i'm supposed to learn anything when i don't know what i'm saying?
rosettastone,1,0,"sure, i can repeat it perfectly after hearing it, but i have no idea what i'm saying in the first place."
rosettastone,1,0,the program will give you pictures and they will describe the picture using the language you want to learn.
rosettastone,1,0,but they dont show a text or relay in your language what they are describing.
rosettastone,1,0,that in it self is what pushed me away from the entire pp.
rosettastone,1,1,you can not access the account page to cancel the automatic subscription renewal.
rosettastone,1,1,passed consumer was the only one i could find and had multiple users complaining about the same issue i'm having.
rosettastone,1,0,it's ridiculous actually.
rosettastone,1,8,"the application looks good but it clashes constantly, and when the pp is office it's really buggy."
rosettastone,1,8,"i have a service for 3 month that i can not use, decently not the best purchase."
rosettastone,1,0,tried the free trial.
rosettastone,1,0,voice recognition is horrible...slow in processing and rarely indicated correct.
rosettastone,1,0,don't waste time downloading just to never get or space back.
rosettastone,1,0,says there's a problem with the system.
rosettastone,1,0,"the pp is great for learning, and i really anna learn more but when i press on purchase all lessons, the page for paying doesn't appear."
rosettastone,1,3,the andros pp is trash by comparison and not worth the scene subscription cost.
rosettastone,1,3,i tried to use it during my morning commune and find that i rarely get a response from the pp when doing pronunciation.
rosettastone,1,3,you have to scream to get a response.
rosettastone,1,3,"don't waste your money here, wait for a slickdeals sale and buy the pp version for a one-time fee."
rosettastone,1,0,they will not remind you that your auto renewal is coming up and you certainly don't get an email when you're charged!
rosettastone,1,0,"plus, doesn't even help with bowels!"
rosettastone,1,0,"i cancel my subscription and said ""no refund are issued."""
rosettastone,1,0,"meaning, they are still going to charge me after i canceled!!!"
rosettastone,1,5,it just kept shipping the lesson and moving on to the next and sometimes just solving the problem itself and moving on.
rosettastone,1,5,really frustration and i would have preferred all the tasks to have been speech recognition but only a few were and the rest were watching a picture to a word.
rosettastone,1,5,if the trial itself wont work properly then how can i have confidence in the real thing.
rosettastone,1,1,the pp renew automatically.
rosettastone,1,0,this is be very counter intuition as you often need to and or third guess.
rosettastone,1,0,customer service is not extent.
rosettastone,1,0,never had a response to my email.
rosettastone,1,0,i also can't cancel subscription
rosettastone,1,5,"but it updated 2 weeks ago and has since not worked, coming up with an error message whenever i click on a module."
rosettastone,1,5,i have contracted the support team twice with regards to it and they are yet to respond with anything more than an email giving me a case number.
rosettastone,1,5,professional and currently just bleeding my bank account for nothing.
rosettastone,1,0,"however, the experience takes a very deep nosedive when interrupted by a pop up after every lesson asking if i'm enjoying the pp."
rosettastone,1,0,it continues to pop up even after i have submitted feedback and i can assure you that the continuous pop up will not make my experience better.
rosettastone,1,0,not my choice.
rosettastone,1,0,"-already chose the proficient level (maintain the language), but still shows me basic things."
rosettastone,1,0,"- come on guns, let your customers taste your product before telling them to pay for it, i can do anything, can learn anything, all you ask is ""payment plan""."
rosettastone,1,1,"constant push modifications asking for money that you can't turn off, landscape view only."
rosettastone,1,0,"they wanted me to disabled the microphone, i needed hear that i was pronouncing the words right, it was to be a free trial and they wanted a credit card."
rosettastone,1,4,i tried the filipino language and was very disappointed.
rosettastone,1,4,i could not get a pass on the pronunciation exercises.
rosettastone,1,4,i have a good phone with a functional microphone and native filipino speakers have told me that i have good pronunciation for the few filipino phrases i know.
rosettastone,1,4,i also question the 100% immersion approach for learning a second language.
rosettastone,1,4,"based on personal experience, i think a little translation mixed in is helpful."
rosettastone,1,7,never spoke japanese but the very first lesson is not explaining anything.
rosettastone,1,7,plus the word match game was presented right away before i was ever taught anything about the spelling or the game.
rosettastone,1,5,"i have a subscription with roseola stone and i'm very displeased with the content, its not telling me the meaning of the words and i feel like it chooses when it wants to hear, sometimes it hears me completely fine and a second later i'm speaking quite loud into it and it can't hear me."
rosettastone,1,0,i got the organ language and i didn't like how it didn't start with the basic letter and pronunciation.
rosettastone,1,6,speech recognition is dead.
rosettastone,1,6,"been promised by teach support for last 5 months that they are ""aware of the issue and working diligently""."
rosettastone,1,0,not buy.
rosettastone,1,0,"they say 30-day guaranteed refund, so i decide to buy the unlimited use japanese version on march and, but i quickly decide (the following day) to cancel it and get it refused, but, i can't!"
rosettastone,1,0,"because i bought it through goose play, i can't get a refund (i tried all the steps they provide, and nothing, goose keeps automatically denying my request)."
rosettastone,1,0,"if you hesitate with your purchase on goose play, you'll get sir*wed over."
rosettastone,1,1,figured it'd give me a chance to see if i got on with it then i could subscribe after next payday.
rosettastone,1,1,"2 hours after signing up, 29.99 gets pulled out of my bank even though i canceled as i was aware of auto renew after 3 days."
rosettastone,1,1,my play store pp is not letting me request a refund (option isn't there?).
rosettastone,1,0,so him trial with more then him of crashing had the best free experience and when i did use it it wouldn register my voice constantly say wrong then move on great trash pp rate do not download
rosettastone,1,0,when something is not free but advertised that way it can get frustration as listed as free
rosettastone,1,144,customer services told me the Â£300 complete courses i bought previously aren't enough and i'm expected to pay the in-pp subscriptions despite the courses being the same content in different wrapping.
rosettastone,1,6,signed me out and won't let me sign back in.
rosettastone,1,6,"i'm now concealing my subscription after not being able to resolve the issue through customer support, but it's not giving me the option for a return if my funds."
rosettastone,1,26,my common sense got me through the first 2 sides but beyond that i had no clue.
rosettastone,1,26,i want to mo what i'm saying and what's being said not guess.
rosettastone,1,35,"while i get the way you are trying to teach, you still need to add a translation or something to tell the user what they are learning, in the domo for japanese there's 1 question that has no rhyme or reason for why its structures the way it is, you literally have to guess, all 4 pictures it showed had nothing i could see to do with each other, and the fill in the blank it gave had no explanation why it went where it did."
rosettastone,1,0,the pp is ok but i had to guess the correct answer because it isn't explained what the actual meaning of it is.
rosettastone,1,0,it also sucks that you have to buy the other lessons like why :/
rosettastone,1,1,"also, it kept saying it couldn't hear me even when i was speaking directly into the microphone."
rosettastone,1,3,i decided to renew it for a year and it still has me locked out of the subscription lessons even thought the transaction is in my bank account and on my goose play store subscriptions list.
rosettastone,1,0,"on 11/4, i left the following 2-star review: ""maybe it's me, or maybe it's my phone, but the pp refuses to believe that i pronounce anything correctly."""
rosettastone,1,0,please send us a feedback email via in-pp settings to follow up with you.
rosettastone,1,0,"open roseola stone, tap the menu (3 horizontal lines), settings, feedback."""
rosettastone,1,0,"for the record, immediately prior to posting my review on 11/4, i did send a detailed feedback email via the in-pp settings."
rosettastone,1,0,i have yet to receive a response from that feedback.
rosettastone,1,0,i have now lowered the rating to 1-star to reflect the poor customer service.
rosettastone,1,0,it would be wonderful if the company would actually allow a real trial sans the payment into.
rosettastone,1,0,not nice!
rosettastone,1,43,"but the pp has me saying things but it does not tell me exactly what i was saying, just pictures that i have to guess."
rosettastone,1,43,definitely will not be purchasing the full version.
rosettastone,1,23,"the pp will ask if you are a beginner, intermediate or advanced, but you cannot open any intermediate lesson without buying them, so the only way to try the pp is to start with the very basis, 'hello and goodby'."
rosettastone,1,23,not buying without trying.
rosettastone,1,6,"only the application is free, but content is paid."
rosettastone,1,6,this should be clear in the description.
rosettastone,1,3,i have access thou my local library but it only lets me do lesson 1 without a charge and the pricking is too steep for me.
rosettastone,1,3,seems helpful but without paid access its painless
rosettastone,1,7,but you find out unlimited is limited real quick.
rosettastone,1,4,the pp takes entirely too long to tell you if you pronounce the word or phrase correctly.
rosettastone,1,4,the pp is good if you only want to know the word but if you want to learn how to say the word use the desktop version.
rosettastone,1,0,"i couldn't use the pp because it kept telling me it couldn't connect to the network because my phone wasn't connected, but it very clearly was indeed connected."
rosettastone,1,0,maybe i'll try again one day.
rosettastone,1,13,"the pp heard and accepted me say 'die fraud' even though i have not said a word (there's no background noise where i am either - even if there had been ,i highly doubt it would sound like properly pronounced german words )."
rosettastone,1,13,"additional ,i could not go back to actually say the word myself ."
rosettastone,1,0,since then i've gotten multiple spasm email a day from them.
rosettastone,1,0,i have subscribed three times and have you even tried to block their email address but they seem to keep getting through.
rosettastone,1,0,just leave me alone.
rosettastone,1,34,i want to give it 5 stars honestly it helped me learn spanish... but it also kept charging me $25 a month without my knowledge!
rosettastone,1,34,"what is even worse is they charge you before they say they will, my subscription was apparently supposed to renew on the with but i was charged a day early on the with and they refuse to refund anything."
rosettastone,1,0,"not free, but does not state it up front, forces you to make an account giving away personal information before it fists the cost into you."
rosettastone,1,0,make the cost front and clear.
rosettastone,1,12,the surname on the pp is not my email email.
rosettastone,1,12,why is it not my email account that i pay the subscription on?
rosettastone,1,12,i've remained but no reply as yet
rosettastone,1,0,didn't run on my andros device.
rosettastone,1,0,what if i would have played in advance?
rosettastone,1,15,"learning first isn't possible with this pp, due to the speech recognition."
rosettastone,1,15,"i've tried multiple microphone, as well as the built in mid on my phone."
rosettastone,1,0,"great program, but the subscription and pp are impossible!"
rosettastone,1,4,there is is no way of slowing down to hear the correct pronunciation.
rosettastone,1,1,funds were pulled from my account for a subscription that i did not authorize.
rosettastone,1,2,i sent feedback via email and instead of an answer to this crazy asking for more money i get some other add about buying more languages from them.. there are better methods that are not after your money.. use at your wallet own risk
rosettastone,1,148,the money was withdrawn from my account twice without any ratification and then they send me an email saying i will only be able to use my subscription for three more days.
rosettastone,1,148,i delete pp and i don't want to be charged anymore.
rosettastone,1,0,no 1-month subscriptions.
rosettastone,1,0,lifetime price is way too expensive.
rosettastone,1,0,speech recognition takes over 60 seconds to process what i've said.
rosettastone,1,0,on the easiest setting it marks what i say wrong even with simple words that i know that i'm pronouncing correctly.
rosettastone,1,2,i have never written a review on goose play before i think.
rosettastone,1,2,stop reaching me and tell me how to activate my account.
rosettastone,1,0,i dont like it because i put my e-mail and it said someone already put this e-mail try again
rosettastone,1,1,"i don't know what's happen, but when i want to sign up, it say my email have been used before."
rosettastone,1,1,"then, i try to sign in, and i can't too."
rosettastone,1,1,"but i never use this pp before, how can it say that my email have already used."
rosettastone,1,1,can you help me?
rosettastone,1,7,"i have paid the 6 month subscription, and it will not work in the pp."
rosettastone,1,7,"i reached out to customer support, to no avail."
rosettastone,1,7,"sadly, 1 star for poor functionality and customer service."
rosettastone,1,2,i've been trying to buy all lessons with the one time payment of $199.99 in the pp on andros goose playstore.
rosettastone,1,2,it decline my payment option consistently.
rosettastone,1,2,my payment option works just fine with other purchases in other apes.
rosettastone,1,0,it appears that way at first but you cannot select first lesson without choosing a payment plan.
rosettastone,1,0,when i do a week in my plan i will get through some and the rest goes away and i lose everything first in learning second my screen went black three it takes me out and starts it again:( dont get the pp i wish i could give it -5 stars
rosettastone,1,1,"latest update takes my login and spine the wheel without stopping, or asks me to login again."
rosettastone,1,6,i have tried the speech recognition on over three devices and it never recognized my voice.
rosettastone,1,0,"i would like to know what i'm saying means in english, not a stupid stock photo!"
rosettastone,1,0,and it doesn't even hear my voice in the practices!!
rosettastone,1,0,it will not let me log in or make a free account i have tried everything and still won't work.
rosettastone,1,0,i know i have one because i have used it before and it says that there is a problem with the account.
rosettastone,1,0,expecting people to pay what can be free.
rosettastone,1,11,i had a 3 day trial on dec th and they charged me on the th which overgrown my account.
rosettastone,1,11,in highly disappointed because i have an email and everything stating i will be charged on the with.
rosettastone,1,0,doesn't teach basic words just gives right in with 3 word phrases and pictures.
rosettastone,1,0,"needs to start out with the basic words such as, the, and, or etc"
rosettastone,1,0,wont let me cancel my subscription.
rosettastone,1,0,dont get it!!!
rosettastone,1,0,add on they remained me back saying your subscription has been canceled and charged me again the next month.
rosettastone,1,4,the cos will not work at all on a chromebook as well.
rosettastone,1,0,does not recognize my voice.
rosettastone,1,0,"i have tried adjusting settings, to no avail."
rosettastone,1,2,was working great for one day but now errors when loading lessons.
rosettastone,1,2,connected on phone and lesson worked perfectly.
rosettastone,1,2,please fix andros version.
rosettastone,1,0,it gives you pictures and you have to guess what they are saying what the picture is before you even learn the words.
rosettastone,1,0,makes you create accounts before you can even tell how much they charge.
rosettastone,1,0,i tried someone's copy - cards method works better anyway.
rosettastone,1,0,it's all advertisements and keep asking for payment/money for nearly every click.
rosettastone,1,0,"you ask for all my information, then tell me there is a 3 day trial but i have to agree to pay the full year first."
rosettastone,1,0,"you should give at least a week free trial, and then i can think about buying it."
rosettastone,1,2,i went to subscribe to the six month option 11.99 a month for six months and it took the entire payment of 69.99 i think that is false advertising and i won't be doing anymore business with this pp
rosettastone,1,1,"you can do the first few lessons for free, but after that you have to pay for a subscription, which is super expensive."
rosettastone,1,0,the speaking exercises are a nightmare.
rosettastone,1,0,i don't think it's a problem with my microphone.
rosettastone,1,0,"i can't help but be really confused it's making me say long sentences out loud on the first day with barely any practice, and it's driving me insane how many times i have to try."
rosettastone,1,3,"i can't start core lesson in chinese language for some reason it gives me an error message, kindly see to it because i just subscribed for 3 months."
rosettastone,1,0,money hungry.
rosettastone,1,0,the company wont give you the mobile languages even though i purchased the desktop versions.
rosettastone,1,0,i am annoyed that it doesn't tell the price.
rosettastone,1,0,i am not signing up for a trial that auto renew in 2 days without knowing the price.
rosettastone,1,2,after 3 days it will automatically charge you $95 without asking.
rosettastone,1,25,"just terrible, i was only expecting a monthly payment of 7.99 a month instead of paying the full annual amount of 94.99 up front, nothing was specified and i lost money because of it"
rosettastone,1,4,when i tried a trial period which was suggested in this pp it took money from my goose account.
rosettastone,1,4,its first time when i get in such strange circumstances while using a trial access in education pp.
rosettastone,1,2,i signed in and the next thing i knew i was on a 3 day trial then paying 50 odd quid.
rosettastone,1,2,i didn't click anything and there's no option to cancel.
rosettastone,1,0,unless you buy the premium you only get 30 mind of content save your money download domingo
rosettastone,1,0,"because after trial it said that i would be charge, but i search where to cancel this pp but not found also my account section dont have as i read in goose to go to the my account section in order to cancel using the account and ask to paid."
rosettastone,1,0,"it doesn't really state what the word means in english, like it's telling me all these different drinks but i don't know if it's naming a specific one."
rosettastone,1,4,"it's only useful if the speech recognition elements aren't used, at all."
rosettastone,1,160,"when you cancel your subscription apparently they keep charging you ""in house,"" so if you e or join again they claim the you own money!"
rosettastone,1,160,"when you verify that you canceled, they tell you that you have to ""cancel directly with them,"" if you cancel via goose subscriptions, it isn't good enough!"
rosettastone,1,6,doesn't work smoothly and it just want you to subscribe.
rosettastone,1,4,never could get the voice phases to work properly.
rosettastone,1,1,30 seconds in (japanese) & it's already on level 100 difficulty.
rosettastone,1,16,i signed up for the free trial advertised in the description and was instantly charged.
rosettastone,1,0,i dont use it anymore and they are still charging me.
rosettastone,1,36,your payment process is frustration.you deduce money from account but do not upgrade plan.
rosettastone,1,36,also you don't reply to complaints.
rosettastone,1,0,the pp was not to bad but when i try to cancel my subscription goose play freeze.
rosettastone,1,2,from course one you are asked to repeat long sentences.
rosettastone,1,2,"if you can't read first, you have to do this purely by audit (listening+repeating) which for many earners isn't possible."
rosettastone,1,20,"hard to get into on filling, contact into etc."
rosettastone,1,20,not happy with the wall around the company.
rosettastone,1,20,can not delete card into etc.
rosettastone,1,0,i like it at first but then it stopped working so i delete it but it has been over a month and i get 3 or more email a day
rosettastone,1,1,you can't give it a try without paying.
rosettastone,1,5,"in the beginning it was unable, but after a while it stop sanctioning"
rosettastone,1,0,the microphone part doesn't work at all
rosettastone,1,0,but it makes you buy 76/80 lessons.
rosettastone,1,0,there were no basis to the alphabet.
rosettastone,1,0,when it gives you words you dont know what it means and there are so many adds
rosettastone,1,0,created an account but was never able to sign in.
rosettastone,1,0,kept saying invalid but upon creating a new account it said already had an account
rosettastone,1,0,could not see text in lower second line of pictures.
rosettastone,1,2,wasn't registering my voice correctly so i got a friend who was born in italy and speaks client italian to speak for me and it kept saying the pronunciation was wrong.
rosettastone,1,0,can't restore purchase for my account
rosettastone,1,1,i speak client spanish but the pp doesn seem to pick up my voice or thinks in pronouncing it wrong.
rosettastone,1,1,plus there been times where ill purposely pronounce words wrong and it'll take it as the answer.
rosettastone,1,6,it's a terrible pp it's very difficult trying understand what the words are actually referring to when it doesn't tell you in your native language i can even figure out if i'm using it correctly
rosettastone,1,21,no month to month subscription ties you into a minimum of an year.
rosettastone,1,4,the pp does not show the translations in english like it says it does and there is no support
rosettastone,1,0,only 3 day trial and goose account gets killed after that.
rosettastone,1,0,false advertisement.
rosettastone,1,4,you can't just say a word over and over and have it written in japanese .
rosettastone,1,0,everyone having a d course paid motivation code should be able to create an account and continue to learn using the pp
rosettastone,1,1,it was advertised as a free trial but then i was charged the full fee.
rosettastone,1,0,but it doesn't say what the word means or anything
rosettastone,1,8,if this meant get fixed i wont be able to talk to my grand.
rosettastone,1,8,she speaks a different language do i can understand a word she us saying.
rosettastone,1,0,"constantly loses network, unclean what to do even in the first lesson, stupid exercises"
rosettastone,1,0,zero quality and too expensive
rosettastone,1,0,dont try only if you anna waist your money.
rosettastone,1,1,i have started the trial period and before it got over i lost k from my bank account and i registered the pp.
rosettastone,1,1,still i have not got back the money.
rosettastone,1,1,also your pp was not working properly on my phone.
rosettastone,1,1,please contact me.
rosettastone,1,7,you can't use an motivation code on mobile anywhere i can find and even when you buy a lifetime of a language be careful what device you pick.
rosettastone,1,0,they say you get a free trial for 3 days and then charge you nearly $100 the next day!
rosettastone,1,0,its good for learning but unless u want to get 4 email a day or paying for a membership i recommend not getting it
rosettastone,1,0,very expensive and does not explain the translation
rosettastone,1,0,i'm trying to pay on the phone but it's not possible... please fix it !
rosettastone,1,0,"you get one free 30 minute lesson, then have to pay for the rest."
rosettastone,1,101,i have not been able to do one lesson because this program only gives you pictures and then words in first.
rosettastone,1,0,pp doesn't work anymore on chromebook.
rosettastone,1,2,opened this pp to take a look and it asked for an account login or creation with no way to skin or not use one before letting me even try any of the lessons.
rosettastone,1,0,the pp does't take my email dress for the account - no option to assure the dress.
rosettastone,1,0,it would tell me to say something and i would but it never told me what i was saying!!!
rosettastone,1,0,pay to learn and endless email that keep coming in even after i asked politely to stop.
rosettastone,1,0,you get a free trial period but you have to make a subscription to it.
rosettastone,1,13,i paid a full membership and 11 days they still wont give me my paid access.
rosettastone,1,8,they want me to buy lessons to clock the rest.
rosettastone,1,0,very expensive when it says free an check that.
rosettastone,1,0,"it is terrible, it charged me for a subscription i did not make"
rosettastone,1,0,in a little kid and this is not good.
rosettastone,1,0,most of it is to put the sentence in the correct place it doesn't let you say anything just a little bit
rosettastone,1,22,"don't download this pp, this pp really does not teach, for example i know spanish basic, but in lesson one, i cannot understand one sentence, what do you want to learn, ""he runs"" with a picture man run?"
rosettastone,1,22,"we need translation, we need know what's mean in our language."
rosettastone,1,22,"this pp can just learn present simple with subject and verb, and things with pictures, also i want delete my account, how can i delete my account?"
rosettastone,1,0,verbal is off on the phone.
rosettastone,1,0,its not
rosettastone,1,0,it would be nice if they told you that you have to give them a credit card number in the description.
rosettastone,1,0,go.ahead and give me the usual response you give everyone else that gave you 1 star.
rosettastone,1,0,ok i'd learn how to pronounce things.. but how do i know what are you talking.i mean how can i understand it when you won't provide the translation!
rosettastone,1,0,sorry but not as i expected.
rosettastone,1,0,uninstalling
rosettastone,1,0,"installed by a rip off ""prize"" web page."
rosettastone,1,4,"if you find anything wrong with it, it must be something you're doing wrong."
rosettastone,1,0,uninstalling.
rosettastone,1,0,it wont let me create a account it kept saying i want connected when i was i pressed that i was from the united states but it wont let me go
rosettastone,1,0,"only ""customer service"", which is closed, can change orders."
rosettastone,1,0,very professional for a top name brand in language learning.
rosettastone,1,0,their customer service is terrible
rosettastone,1,0,requires a separate account outside goose play.
rosettastone,1,64,moved on without me saying the right thing.
rosettastone,1,0,totally ridiculous that its not telling you what words you are saying.
rosettastone,1,0,thanks but i think i'll direct my hard-earned money on something that going to actually teach me on many levels.
rosettastone,1,0,"boat""; as wont sd install, so ""asia la ."""
rosettastone,1,0,it just gives me pictures and dose not even in english than in spanish
rosettastone,1,0,i cannot rest my password it doesn give an option .
rosettastone,1,0,"it did not have the language i needed, when i tried to contact the company it would not send the request"
rosettastone,1,0,i selected to learn english and it gave me the instructions in english??
rosettastone,1,0,it did not show me what i was saying in english but only filipino.
rosettastone,1,1,doesn have any explanation to the language.
rosettastone,1,0,i had a hard time signing in
rosettastone,1,5,it doesn't teach me in a way that helps me.
rosettastone,1,0,deceptive charged me for full amount instead of monthly
rosettastone,1,0,canceled first month and never received a refund
rosettastone,1,1,"free trial when u sign up,wasted data downloading thanks"
rosettastone,1,0,why do i need to register when it already has my goose account into?
rosettastone,1,0,can't even sign up ð
rosettastone,1,0,i had a count now its not letting me in
rosettastone,1,0,it wouldn't load when i made a account.
rosettastone,1,1,on goose it says it free than you pay after making your account
rosettastone,1,0,wont let me cancel my subscription
rosettastone,1,0,terrible couldn't get to start an account
rosettastone,1,5,this pp sucks please dont get it you have to pay 60$ every month
rosettastone,1,0,thought it was free...i installed...will my card be killed
rosettastone,1,1,it wouldn let me cancel and it kept charging me
rosettastone,1,0,"terrible , didn't teach me anything just went strait ahead to the hard stuff even though it was on basic."
rosettastone,1,0,no also... stop asking me to rate your application
rosettastone,1,0,"i signed in, i don't want to use it or get a bill."
rosettastone,1,0,i can't find a way to remove the account.
rosettastone,1,0,how to delete the account?
rosettastone,1,0,reaches you the language you anna learn with pick dose not give you word description the of exactly what your learning about
rosettastone,1,0,this game wouldn't tell me the means of the word so i couldn't find the answer
rosettastone,1,0,i hate this i delete the pp and rossetta stone keep sending me email i absolutely hate it
rosettastone,1,0,there is no response to any mail .
rosettastone,1,0,i don't understand you have sent me an email saying what i should do to get a refund.
rosettastone,1,0,now when i have already remained you the issue there is again no response to that.
rosettastone,1,0,not an office ppð
rosettastone,1,0,"i delete it yesterday and today it want let me put my email in i'm furious dumb pp, ugly, stupid ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ðð ð"
rosettastone,1,0,can't cancel same day and get refund.
rosettastone,1,0,the whole thing should be free!
rosettastone,1,0,i hate it all you do is say it and don't even learn.
rosettastone,1,0,don't down load it.
rosettastone,1,4,doesn't recognise correct speech.
rosettastone,2,32,it signs you out after you exit so you have to mentally sign in everytime you open the pp.
rosettastone,2,32,"the pp will not load and will say its network connection problems, despite my nearly perfect internet connection."
rosettastone,2,19,buggy interface on my andros device makes replying sounds frustration because the pp thinks you are selecting an answer.
rosettastone,2,19,"also the mid is unable to differentiate even simple absent noise, making the spoken exercises impossible in anything other than a silent padded room."
rosettastone,2,0,has the biggest struggle recognizing what i'm saying.
rosettastone,2,0,i have to repeat myself 12 times for it to register what i say.
rosettastone,2,1,"voice recognition says in too loud no matter how quietly i speak after the last few updated, making me frustrated to go through each lesson."
rosettastone,2,0,it is great but it would be better if you will make half of materials in the pp free
rosettastone,2,0,only thing is my time frame to learn it is at work and during nap time so learning with sleeping kiss makes it a little hard when needing to be quit but can't wait to get free time after work when at home life is less busy i like it
rosettastone,2,31,"also, the speech recognition needs work."
rosettastone,2,31,"i've had several instances where i said the correct answer perfectly, and all the words lit up as correct, but then it gives me a red ""x"" and i have to say it again."
rosettastone,2,2,"some of the exercises use icons too small to see on a mobile device, and it can't be transferred to an external storage device."
rosettastone,2,2,i can't use it office because it takes too much storage space.
rosettastone,2,8,i've used headphones and the mid on the phone and it does not recognize my voice consistently.
rosettastone,2,8,i see this is a regular theme with this pp as many others have said the same.
rosettastone,2,1,"the pp is cool and has taught me a good amount, but it doesn't explain why i use certain words in certain sentences."
rosettastone,2,1,this is frustration cause in on week 5 and still can't form my own sentences because i don't know what words to use or why i would use those words.
rosettastone,2,8,love the pp but terrible customer service!!!!
rosettastone,2,8,overcharged me.
rosettastone,2,8,i live in atlantic canada.
rosettastone,2,8,i told them that's where i live.
rosettastone,2,8,and then i'm effectively not helped and transferred in circles.
rosettastone,2,8,i'll go with a competitor instead.
rosettastone,2,13,the microphone performance is extremely louse.
rosettastone,2,13,"nor can you select or even see what input device is being used, if for example a bluetooth device is connected."
rosettastone,2,94,it tries to offer the same functionality like the desktop but fails.
rosettastone,2,94,"the problems that i encountered are: 1.the pictures are too small, 2.is lacking functionality of the desktop version, 3.twitching between japanese alphabet is a pain, 4.the pp sometimes forgets the credentials, 5.it requires constant internet connection even if you choose to download the lesson."
rosettastone,2,35,when i repeat something exactly it tells me i said it incorrectly.
rosettastone,2,35,then i humble some jibberish and it tells me i said it correctly.
rosettastone,2,35,most of the time in not 100% sure what i am learning to say because in just repeating words.
rosettastone,2,35,wish i could get a refund.
rosettastone,2,35,"if you learn from just repeating then buy it, if not, save your money."
rosettastone,2,6,i need to see the translation in order to know exactly what i'm saying.
rosettastone,2,6,this program does not allow you to customize settings to minimize the individuals learning style.
rosettastone,2,1,"i had no idea what the words were and could not pass, for me it was a bad pp."
rosettastone,2,8,"i want a refund, but goose pay is not registering it!!"
rosettastone,2,2,but making me pay full price right up front before i even get a chance to try it i'm over that!
rosettastone,2,1,"it's telling me how to pronounce words but doesn't tell you what the words mean, instead it has a small picture which can be interpreted in many different ways."
rosettastone,2,0,"when i clicked a button, e.g."
rosettastone,2,0,lesson 2 core lesson the pp would instead bring me to lesson 1 listening and reading.
rosettastone,2,2,no option other than monthly subscription.
rosettastone,2,2,even simple sounds either dont get picked up or are impossible to pass
rosettastone,2,0,the pp forced me to leave this review by asking me every time i complete an activity.
rosettastone,2,0,you dont actually learn the phrases it just makes you guess pictures and match them to the phrase.
rosettastone,2,0,it's for learning languages but the way they do it has no back up at least in the free min lessons they show me a woman eating but don't say woman or female or anything just that and would not recommend really
rosettastone,2,1,sons: -lacks depth.
rosettastone,2,1,a one month course or podcast can teach you far more than the whole pp.
rosettastone,2,2,the voice recognition system is horrible
rosettastone,2,0,because most the items for pay not free
rosettastone,2,0,poor user experience and poor i. feels like it's made in flash!
rosettastone,2,0,"very poor layout, poor learning tools."
rosettastone,2,0,sometimes i can't understand what those characters mean and it's very hard to use by the sound inman to translate them into english in goose translator.
rosettastone,2,0,"there is no written translations, only pictures, which can be confusing."
rosettastone,2,0,there was no explanations for grammar etc.
rosettastone,2,0,"it's very impersonal, even the modifications are vague and impersonal."
rosettastone,2,0,need a big phone screen to see the small pictures clearly and sharp eyes.
rosettastone,2,0,no grammar explanations.
rosettastone,2,0,"based on early lessons, i gave up."
rosettastone,2,1,"not good for kiss,it is very hard to recognize kiss voice."
rosettastone,2,1,"i am try using this pp with my 6 years son learn english,stuck at ""a girl is drinking"",i am try lot of times,include loud and whisper,adjust option to male or femaleï¼adjust sensitivity.all not work.still not recognize."
rosettastone,2,0,voice recognition on the pp basically doesn work.
rosettastone,2,0,it works fine on the desktop version the.
rosettastone,2,0,give also tried to contact customer service and there no one on hand and no one gets back to you.
rosettastone,2,0,too expensive.
rosettastone,2,0,"but, you have to buy the pp."
rosettastone,2,0,mio it should be included in the (not cheap) price of the d program.
rosettastone,2,0,isnthis free to create an account and learn any language?or are there hidden fees?
rosettastone,2,7,"i read some reviews and seemed it was worth the money because it came with free lessons, but that's not the case you have to pay."
rosettastone,2,7,"if you have a price and an offer have one, not several it means you don't value your product."
rosettastone,2,7,grammar lessons are unclear you have to figure it out as there is no definition or english translation.
rosettastone,2,0,2019 year by the way.
rosettastone,2,0,add login with ff/goose account!
rosettastone,2,0,"i follow the directions (in download pp, don't launch, but activate through the library)."
rosettastone,2,0,"i do a rest through my email, sign in and in in the middle of hind which i hasn't choose."
rosettastone,2,0,"roseola tells me it's a domo copy, delete."
rosettastone,2,0,for me trying to learn organ it says the word and has you guess the picture or will have you repeat the word or phrase and will not give a meaning.
rosettastone,2,0,also when you sign up they don't tell you about the automatic renewal so that is an expensive surprise.
rosettastone,2,6,i also went out of my way to try in various environment to make sure there was no background noise for the speaker to confuse what i saying.
rosettastone,2,0,"i know it's a wonderful product, but it should have been forthcoming instead of wasting my time luring me in, when i knew up front i couldn't pay anything."
rosettastone,2,8,"i have an additional set of concerns w the pp (now that i have gotten my subscription issues resolved) - the images at the top, when selecting what picture belongs with the words, are incredibly small and hard to decipher at times."
rosettastone,2,8,"secondly, even the beginner version is a bit too fast, when i hit pause to be able to absorb what being said, it doesn pause the screen."
rosettastone,2,8,it brings me back to the menu of chapters in the lesson.
rosettastone,2,41,but the pp isn't very good the pictures are just too small for a smartphone.
rosettastone,2,41,and that's with my glasses.
rosettastone,2,41,the pp freeze a lot and i can't select anything.
rosettastone,2,2,"if the media volume is down i can raise it easily in pp, i have to either fiddle with the sound option or load a game and increase it there."
rosettastone,2,2,"also when ever i load the pp it is never on my next lesson, its always like 5 ahead or 5 behind for some reason."
rosettastone,2,2,"there are also times when it just doesn pick up my phone mid until i start the pp, even though it was working the lesson before."
rosettastone,2,1,if you want to learn a language this pp is good to instal but when you are learning the language it asks you to say a certain phrase but it always says that the audit is too loud.
rosettastone,2,6,"everytime i use the pp on andros it requires me to go through the whole sign in process of putting in my email, password, and work code."
rosettastone,2,6,it has really limited my usage as i would have to log in multiple times a day just to continue a lesson.
rosettastone,2,2,"but while learning makarin, it would pair the wrong pictures to the phrase and trip me up."
rosettastone,2,2,"like saying ""those people are cooking"" while showing a picture of people walking as the correct paring."
rosettastone,2,2,i wish i was allowed a free trial instead.
rosettastone,2,101,this is a terrible option if you are trying to learn japanese.
rosettastone,2,101,i have consistent problems with the voice recognition.
rosettastone,2,101,my setting are correct and i have tried uninstalling and reinstating yet the issues persist.
rosettastone,2,0,"ok, so i'm trying japanese, and it's just showing me a picture, and giving me a sentence, and you match them."
rosettastone,2,0,"it's almost 100% guess work, it still hasn't gone over the japanese letters or compared the japanese with english."
rosettastone,2,8,i was pretty happy at first but then became extremely disappointed.
rosettastone,2,8,"there are no english subtitles, so you have no idea what the english translation is effectively making all your learning go down the drain."
rosettastone,2,8,"they throw random words at you, without a translation!"
rosettastone,2,8,don't bother installing it.
rosettastone,2,0,however the lessons are long and boring.
rosettastone,2,0,"also, it will automatically charge you for another subscription even if you don't use it."
rosettastone,2,0,update after smiling the company i was given a refund.
rosettastone,2,10,pp clashes with almost every update or when you refuse to review.
rosettastone,2,9,the pp doesn't tell you what the phrase is it only shows you the picture as well it won't say the phrase with picture it just says it separately making your brain see a pattern instead of just learning the phrase.
rosettastone,2,9,i have only learned boy and girl but i dont even know of that's what it is because it could just be man and woman this all because i never was shown the phrases definition and was left to guess.
rosettastone,2,35,it pick up every little sound other than voices.
rosettastone,2,35,i've said the words 30 times in the time it is trying to check me in and it registers that i couldn't properly make the word.
rosettastone,2,2,"that's what i thought when i finished lesson 1. that thought quickly changed when i went to do lesson 2, the pp would not let me begin the lesson without a charge!"
rosettastone,2,0,pp requires microphone lessons.
rosettastone,2,3,it reaches some words then goes into sentences with the words but at some point leaves out a word to teach in the sentence so have to guess what it is saying than learn
rosettastone,2,9,"the pp still shows reading and grammar questions even i picked ""listening and speaking"" only for my child."
rosettastone,2,9,moreover it does not show whether it uses the internal or external mid in andros making it hard to debut audit issues.
rosettastone,2,1,i like the language methodology but the pp is utterly useless on a mobile device due to the poor layout and user interface.
rosettastone,2,1,when i called their teach support they recommended i use it on a computer.
rosettastone,2,5,support.
rosettastone,2,5,i explained the issue in many mails.
rosettastone,2,5,"but then just got ignored and received no further response, even after following up from my side."
rosettastone,2,2,"voice recognition needs work, i have a fixed 3 and it can't understand me half the time with the earbuds in."
rosettastone,2,2,"it doesn't say my pronunciation is off, just doesn't hear one part, then fine on the next part."
rosettastone,2,6,"i bought the actual roseola, but wanted something mobile."
rosettastone,2,6,i was disappointed to find that i could not tie my very expensive normal version to the mobile.
rosettastone,2,6,this seems very wrong to me.
rosettastone,2,6,"great language leaving option but way to much money, honestly i prefer domingo purely because it's free and you can complete all courses without paying, with roseola, you can do two or three lessons and then you have to pay Â£100 a year."
rosettastone,2,16,but today i couldn't open it anymore.
rosettastone,2,16,"i tried several times, even installed and installed, but still couldn't work any more."
rosettastone,2,16,i just topped up one year membership.l
rosettastone,2,2,"it didn't have the option to select that or law languages, and when i was routed to the main webster, the webster was nonresponsive."
rosettastone,2,3,the practices seem good and like they would be effective but the pp can never hear me.
rosettastone,2,0,"but when doing the basic like ""la filled bit,"" it would not accept my voice... not what i expected."
rosettastone,2,0,"i started core i unit i and despite having it set on adult male, it doesn't recognize my voice."
rosettastone,2,0,"today, i attempted to re-do core 1 because i didn't do too well on the first try, it now shoots me an error please try again message for all lessons."
rosettastone,2,0,i have installed and re-installed... i have sent an e-mail to support.
rosettastone,2,0,can you please help me to resolve this!
rosettastone,2,0,i am on andros
rosettastone,2,1,requires me to log in every time i bring the pp to the foreground.
rosettastone,2,1,doesn't even let me store login credentials in andros's key-chain.
rosettastone,2,11,it's not picking up my voice.
rosettastone,2,11,"i have remained, treated but i don't get a response."
rosettastone,2,2,it's gets confusing with no actual translations and just pictures.
rosettastone,2,2,leaves you guessing a lot and not actually learning it properly.
rosettastone,2,1,"annoying asks you to review it all the time, even after you already have (especially irritating since i paid for this)."
rosettastone,2,1,i guess i'll just keep giving different rating.
rosettastone,2,3,"tried the free 30 min discovery, and after an pp switch, the play sound button didn't work anymore on multiple slide/course."
rosettastone,2,3,when pressing i got a 'not enough memory' but my one plus 3 had like 5 go free of ram..
rosettastone,2,0,"has a hard time hearing everything i say, with or without headphones, i have to yell for it to recognize me."
rosettastone,2,3,every third pronunciation it doesn't record audit and never works.
rosettastone,2,2,except for the fact that you can only get one lesson then have to pay 200$ for the rest of it.
rosettastone,2,1,"canceled my subscription on goose play, but then got charged again through their webster, with no way to contact them to get my $80 back."
rosettastone,2,2,the andros pp does not have translations.
rosettastone,2,0,it lacks the english translation and actual explanation of how the grammar works.
rosettastone,2,0,i say just disabled microphone.
rosettastone,2,1,i was saying the words exactly the same and each time it recorded something different.
rosettastone,2,5,why can't i create an account?
rosettastone,2,5,"the pp says it has problems with its system and ask to try to later, but through some time the same happens again."
rosettastone,2,2,"this pp is so begged, i click on the subscribe option but nothing load, the loading dots appear and then disappear."
rosettastone,2,0,i wasn't able to login in to my account on the mobile pp.
rosettastone,2,0,i have the desktop account which i'm able to login to.
rosettastone,2,0,"please, can ye help me."
rosettastone,2,2,i love the pp but the breaking rate this pp pop up is driving me nuts.
rosettastone,2,0,due it explains nothing!
rosettastone,2,0,"in other languages that would be ok i bet it reaches the latin languages very well, but makarin is a total language."
rosettastone,2,0,you cannot speak it correctly if you don't use the right tone.
rosettastone,2,0,after i forgot something it wouldn't let me do it again even though i used the rest button.
rosettastone,2,15,although it was great there are apes out there such as do lingo that give the option to pay to clock all lessons but if u choose not to you can clock them for free by processing which is a satisfying reward scheme.
rosettastone,2,0,i hate the fact that it just gives in and just assumes that we know the language already in the first lesson.
rosettastone,2,0,nothing free here trial period 3 days and automatically bills you from goose play.. sick
rosettastone,2,2,just pictures and the program saying words.
rosettastone,2,2,the program left me confused as to what some of the pictures were trying to pair up with the words or phrases through out the syllabus.
rosettastone,2,2,in the end i was using goose translate to clarify what i was trying to learn.
rosettastone,2,2,on the plus side i have learnt a lot of words but unfortunately did'it reach my goal to speak it conversational.
rosettastone,2,0,can't get past lesson 1 without crashing.
rosettastone,2,3,i have a terribly hard time speaking sentences in first based on hearing.
rosettastone,2,3,i need a reference to read from as i forget the phrase i am supposed to repeat.
rosettastone,2,3,"the reference is written in first, but i have no idea how to read it, and honestly would prefer learning the speaking part."
rosettastone,2,0,"it's ok, they teach you the words but they don't say what they mean ink if it's just me but it doesn't really tell me what the words mean but just show pictures which could sometimes be hard to understand what it could mean."
rosettastone,2,2,but why do you have to pay for more lessons.
rosettastone,2,0,i don't understand why it scores you on how accurate the accent is when you speak.
rosettastone,2,7,"tried the ""dont see a language you like, let us know"" button."
rosettastone,2,7,it won't even let me submit it.
rosettastone,2,0,i didn't notice that it cost automatically after period and i never want to study organ because i am from more.
rosettastone,2,0,i can't even log in for some reason
rosettastone,2,0,i bet its amazing but i can't afford it because i don't have the money for it (it's $94.99 a month)
rosettastone,2,0,"terrible teach support, crazy prices"
rosettastone,2,0,"just jumped straight into it, i didn't see an alphabet or anything."
rosettastone,2,0,the voice recognition is a ð© emboli.
rosettastone,2,0,reduce ask size and update german
rosettastone,2,0,i hate the fact that we have to make an account for this pp.
rosettastone,2,0,how do you close the pp?
rosettastone,3,8,it works fine if you do a lesson without stopping then don't play around with anything.
rosettastone,3,8,in doing this it seems to mess up progress in other sections or something.
rosettastone,3,8,biggest one is i will accidentally hit the back button during say a core lesson and it will make me start over.
rosettastone,3,1,sometimes the translation work other times it doesn't.
rosettastone,3,1,the pronouncing is way too fast and does not break up the speaking portion at all you where you can grasp the words.
rosettastone,3,1,i paid for the subscription and you don't even get all of the lessons.
rosettastone,3,1,"doesn't support headphone mid or us / bluetooth heads mid, appears to only be using the built mid on my phone, some words are heard perfectly but others it pick up nothing at all and suggests i disabled speech recognition."
rosettastone,3,1,maybe a manual mid boost slide in the settings plus support for us / bluetooth headsets would help this?
rosettastone,3,21,if you're rolling through the lessons then they show up in the order they are supposed to.
rosettastone,3,21,"if you back out to the main menu and then click on a lesson, the wrong lesson comes up and you have to stroll through the lessons subfolders until you find the one you are looking for."
rosettastone,3,7,the latest update took away the pronunciation of each answer.
rosettastone,3,7,"now when you click an answer, it just moves on to the next one causing you to guess pronunciation in your head."
rosettastone,3,7,"in the past, after you chose an answer, a man or woman would repeat that answer aloud (which was a helpful immersion technique)"
rosettastone,3,0,"when the package works, it is great, but customer service is appalling."
rosettastone,3,0,"for example, i paid Â£300 for a full package with download, but my lawton was destroyed by canals."
rosettastone,3,5,it heads straight into whole phrases that don't tell you what each word means so the person basically has to guess with the pictures.
rosettastone,3,0,"i have not attempted to use the microphone, and i have only tried the first lesson of both portuguese and spanish."
rosettastone,3,3,used to be able to tap on a word or phrase and translate to english.
rosettastone,3,3,kind of silly.
rosettastone,3,0,the only thing i would add is the enunciation under the word.
rosettastone,3,1,i do like the fact they use pictures in their lessons.
rosettastone,3,0,"the pictures and text are too small for a phone pp.... other that that, i love it."
rosettastone,3,0,but why isn't it possible to do writing lessons via mobile phone?
rosettastone,3,2,functionality does not always work?
rosettastone,3,2,"click on lesson 3, pp goes to lesson 2 and does not always allow to go back to the middle of the lesson if there was an interruption"
rosettastone,3,1,good lessons but the focus on past and present tense etc seems more important in the pp than it should be for learning the basis.
rosettastone,3,0,can even start learning.
rosettastone,3,0,"when i start a lesson (dutch), i just get a blank screen which is responsive."
rosettastone,3,9,$200 is too much up front to clock all of the units and i'm unwilling to pay monthly for something i'll never own.
rosettastone,3,9,there 20 units for spanish and i'd lady pay $10 to clock each unit as i progress.
rosettastone,3,0,having problem putting new amazon prime purchase key into old learning pp from trial.
rosettastone,3,7,"i can see the potential with the pronunciation help and everything, but i didn't get far with it because i am too advanced to be experiencing a trial on absolute beginner level."
rosettastone,3,7,i can't build any kind of interest or reliance on the pp while testing it if i can't pick the level.
rosettastone,3,3,"on a positive side, the 1 language i have access to does have really good lessons."
rosettastone,3,0,hard to navigable at times
rosettastone,3,3,still having issues with the voice recognition but i just disabled it.
rosettastone,3,13,"the format is good, though the images are sometimes not as big/clear as i would like."
rosettastone,3,13,"the grammar instruction could be better, i would like more information presented when an incorrect selection is made so i know clearly what i did wrong."
rosettastone,3,13,"the pp does not always hear me, that's my main frustration."
rosettastone,3,14,the two problems that i have are not having any explanation of what grammar i am learning and no way for me to gauge how well my pronunciation is.
rosettastone,3,1,i purchased both russian and spanish several years back but the mobile pp will not allow access unless i purchase the mobile course.
rosettastone,3,0,"great pp overall but the one thing that's irritating is that whenever it's speaking test, i said the words correctly several times but they say it's incorrect."
rosettastone,3,5,the first lesson should be explaining the sounds and the alphabet and a general idea of how that language works.
rosettastone,3,0,great but bug in latest release - selecting a particular lesson doesn't take me to the lesson it takes me to the next latest available one.
rosettastone,3,0,sometimes the program stalls or has blank boxes(happened in learning colors among others).
rosettastone,3,2,great pp but quite expensive.
rosettastone,3,2,maybe an ad supported version would be nice.
rosettastone,3,2,the pronunciation would be nice to have all words spoken in a male voice when u select or a male
rosettastone,3,1,i like it but goes too fast and hard to hear correctly.
rosettastone,3,1,also should give feature to review instead of moving forward to next lesson
rosettastone,3,0,the only issue for me is that you can learn more than one language at once
rosettastone,3,3,i'm more advance in the language i'm learning and i hated how dueling had me start at th very basic.
rosettastone,3,3,i gave it 3 star due to the fact that i just download the pp.
rosettastone,3,2,"enjoying using the pp, but it's not registering my progress."
rosettastone,3,2,i finish a lesson on 100% but it doesn't tick it off as completed.
rosettastone,3,2,"also, on core 1; it says i've completed 30 out of 31, but i can't find the last lesson?"
rosettastone,3,7,however there are stitches i.e.
rosettastone,3,7,when you try to pronounce a word sometimes the just doesn't hear it no matter how loud you are.
rosettastone,3,2,"learning with pick is nice but lost 2 stars because the pronunciation level should consider who is interpreting, everyone has an accent, could be a bit more forgiving there."
rosettastone,3,2,"also, not free to go beyond level 1..."
rosettastone,3,0,"it seems like the voice recognition is a bit buggy, or my accent is that bad"
rosettastone,3,0,there were certain stages were i would have to guess the phrase before i was taught the words.
rosettastone,3,4,star is because this pp used almost rude photo in the learning contents which was very disturbing.
rosettastone,3,4,and pronunciation system is not good for arabic.
rosettastone,3,2,i tried restoring it but it said i had nothing to restore.
rosettastone,3,1,"it helped me learn new words but, all of the writing was in hiragana, katakana, and anti."
rosettastone,3,1,i only can read hiragana and katakana.
rosettastone,3,1,please put it in roman too.
rosettastone,3,1,i'm just lucky enough to have learned hiragana and katakana.
rosettastone,3,1,very buggy.
rosettastone,3,1,"can you please fix the bug were it is not testing my speech, just going to the next picture."
rosettastone,3,0,i wish i didn't need a computer to have the live sessions.
rosettastone,3,0,"i can't use the total version, when i'm not home."
rosettastone,3,0,"i'm in basis, would be nice if they actually told you what the words were you were saying instead of just pictures trying to figure out what they mean"
rosettastone,3,1,text and pictures are a little hard to see on the mobile pp however.
rosettastone,3,1,wish there was a way to play at night to go to sleep without having to respond or tap
rosettastone,3,1,you don't often know what the words are that you are learning i wish they told you the meaning you're supposed to interpret it by the pictures which aren't always clear.
rosettastone,3,0,a bit basic and slow unless you purchase the full package.
rosettastone,3,0,good so far...some issues with microphone not being accurate
rosettastone,3,0,good to start basic vietnamese with lacking in learning layout should start with alphabet learning first then go onto grammar structure instead its reversed but overall it's good program
rosettastone,3,0,great though bit too expensive for what you get
rosettastone,3,0,voice recognition varies from spot on to stone deaf :/
rosettastone,3,0,"great pp, but it's just too expensive."
rosettastone,3,0,"the only problem i have is i dont know what in saying, it doesn't explain what in saying in english."
rosettastone,3,0,i would suggest that there should be an english translation after the spanish sentences.
rosettastone,3,0,"this product is excellent with pictures, but they should give you an alphabet to help you understand a little more if you are trying to emerge your self in learning the language."
rosettastone,3,0,i feel as though your just throwing photo at me.
rosettastone,3,0,"also, i feel like this program would be good with you currently studying the language in school."
rosettastone,3,0,and develop the explanation of the grammar.
rosettastone,3,0,when you respond please tell me why you did this.
rosettastone,3,0,"there is no english translation, and its so annoying when they just throw in a new word you've never seen before and all you have is the picture to explain it."
rosettastone,3,0,"most of the time, the picture honestly doesn't help explain the sentence, and its on you to guess what it means and make sense out of it with the words you do recognize."
rosettastone,3,0,i wish it was more beginner friendly.
rosettastone,3,0,the pp trial does not teach phrases needed for travel not in the first two units.
rosettastone,3,0,it shows images that are too small to see but expects you to choose which one matches the foreign word or phrase you are learning.
rosettastone,3,0,it shows an image so you relate the image to the phrase.
rosettastone,3,6,the lessons can get very repetition and dry.
rosettastone,3,6,-allow settings to slow listening exercises down or speed them up (or settings to switch to faster-speaking voices) to adjust to one's competence -weak lesson framework.
rosettastone,3,0,"i'm just started today , but i found what i need like listening and speaking , i hope in next lesson i will gain more information and practicing , thank you roseola and i wish if the duration of free lessons is longer"
rosettastone,3,0,sometimes the learner needs to go back and review his/her items.
rosettastone,3,0,but there is no back feature in this pp.
rosettastone,3,0,the pronunciation lessons often don't register that you're talking.
rosettastone,3,0,also if you look at a translation while it is twitching to the next lesson it will crash the pp.
rosettastone,3,5,the speech recognition is decent but has a hard time with background noise.
rosettastone,3,0,right from the start the first lesson starts presenting pictures and speaking full sentences in japanese of the action depicted.
rosettastone,3,0,no translation.
rosettastone,3,0,the first few were easy because i knew some of the words in advance and could easily guess the right picture based upon that but it was like cheating.
rosettastone,3,0,by the end of the first introductory lesson it was expecting me to say the full sentence of a man reading a book (i am guessing).
rosettastone,3,0,you could easily assume the wrong thing and learn incorrectly.
rosettastone,3,0,"the lessons are laid out in a helpful order, and i like how the core lesson ties together the vocabulary, grammar, listening, and speaking."
rosettastone,3,0,"the speaking part is extremely itchy, though."
rosettastone,3,0,"many times it says it can't hear me, even if i speak loudly in a silent room."
rosettastone,3,0,other times it says i am saying the word wrong no matter how correctly i say it.
rosettastone,3,0,"my wife is organ, and it will occasionally when tell her that she is saying basic words wrong."
rosettastone,3,2,on the + side: the lessons are well organised.
rosettastone,3,2,"on the - side: i don't find that the voice recognition works very well, it is happy with whatever you say."
rosettastone,3,2,the pp sometimes forgets about your progress and you need to repeat lessons.
rosettastone,3,3,i do have a somewhat major complaint though where i think the pp could and should be improved.
rosettastone,3,3,"on the speaking sections that require you to comprehend what's happening in a picture to say what the pp wants, it should give you some time to process what it wants you to say before it listens for an answer."
rosettastone,3,3,its especially difficult to figure out what it wants you to say when you are taking lessons on a small phone screen
rosettastone,3,24,but there are other times when i find it frustration.
rosettastone,3,24,"often, i haven't figured out what the new words mean, and the program advances with feeling like i paid for a program that isn't for me."
rosettastone,3,0,"i like it overall but i use it on my phone and for the provocation it does not understand me and when i ask my wife, she says i am saying it correctly but the pp says i'm not."
rosettastone,3,0,even more it says it cannot hear me or too loud when using same volume that worked for the word before that one.
rosettastone,3,11,"with zero vocal at all, even when i work out the grammar i can't put it into context because i don't know common words like milk and bike and swim, which they use for context."
rosettastone,3,10,"the pp is almost exactly like the desktop program, and the combination of verbal repetition and pectoral + text quires is effective."
rosettastone,3,10,one major negative is that the learn english program is labelled in advanced english and first time earners will struggle to navigable the venus.
rosettastone,3,10,"if you have a budget phone without the native language of the user, it will be a struggle."
rosettastone,3,0,i like the fact that i have to repeat what i hear so i know if i'm pronouncing it correctly.
rosettastone,3,0,"however, after a year i don't speak spanish at all."
rosettastone,3,0,"also, the online version has more lessons that the pp but i can't get it to work on any computer, there are to many system requirements."
rosettastone,3,12,"(edit) having hard time in speech recognition, i changed the settings still i am shouting here to practice pronunciation lesson."
rosettastone,3,12,"need good internet connection though, pp is not very light on data consumption."
rosettastone,3,0,"it's good that i studied the hiragana and katakana on domingo to at least help me grasp what was going on in the japanese lessons, so far i'm only at the beginning but the anti is confusing me a lot with not much context other than pictures to go along with it, i wish or hope that something to help you memories their alphabet will be implements in the future or will pop up in the future"
rosettastone,3,4,"the voice recognition worked great the first few times i used it, even with some background noise."
rosettastone,3,4,"the last few times i have tried to use it though it has been horrible, not registering anything i say."
rosettastone,3,4,"i just hope the voice recognition gets better, it's the main reason i only gave 3 stars."
rosettastone,3,3,works better at voice recognition than my computer but its missing the written parts of the lessons that only show on the computer.
rosettastone,3,3,also i have caught the voice recognition getting a few (admitting similar) sounds mixed up.
rosettastone,3,4,"overall good, but the dictation portion of the pp fails to hear you almost all the time."
rosettastone,3,4,"additional, when i tried to submit feedback, as the developer suggested, it was impossible to hit 'submit' because the keyboard blocked the button, and there is no way to collapse it."
rosettastone,3,0,could explain little better but is fun
rosettastone,3,38,"the desktop version prompt you to red lessons occasionally to help train long term memory, but the pp doesn't do that at all."
rosettastone,3,38,"once a unit is finished, the pp never suggests that you practice the words ever again, so you'll need to rest and repeat lessons on your own."
rosettastone,3,4,trying to learn while riding in a car going down the road and speaking is ridiculous.
rosettastone,3,4,it's not using the bluetooth microphone on my heads.
rosettastone,3,4,it requires me to speak to the microphone in the phone and even though people are telling me i say it perfectly it's giving me a red x every time on certain phrases and then others it gives me a full green circle.
rosettastone,3,4,i will add that domingo works perfectly in the car.
rosettastone,3,7,i wish the writing part were at least an option in the pp.
rosettastone,3,7,"during speaking parts, i wish they would give you more time."
rosettastone,3,7,"sometimes you need to think about what you are saying and with the quick time, i am rushing just to repeat than to be mindful of what i am saying."
rosettastone,3,0,"there are several very annoying bags:  - periodically it starts ""continue automatically to next screen"" even when this option is turned off;  -  sometimes it does not recognize the voice;  - long loading time;  - after started shows the random lesson in the unit to learn instead of the first to be done."
rosettastone,3,0,the pronunciation quires are a had boring after doing a few in a row.
rosettastone,3,0,just started but in learning.
rosettastone,3,0,the drawback is that there are no definitions to the words.
rosettastone,3,1,"i mean if i don't know what ""el no core"" means in english it's kind of painless."
rosettastone,3,1,they say picture is worth a thousand words and that's what i'm afraid of when i stumble onto a word or picture i'm not familiar with.
rosettastone,3,1,"it would be nice if i can double tap on the word and it'll spin around and break down what the word means and what noun, gender or adjective and how it connect."
rosettastone,3,1,pronunciation is a very tough with mid provided in box.
rosettastone,3,1,give better mid!
rosettastone,3,28,my problem is i want to go premium but refuse to pay for months in advance that i don't know if i even want.
rosettastone,3,28,maybe a month from now ill find that its not for me.
rosettastone,3,28,"i'm not forming up that kind of money for the mere thought that i ""might"" want to keep the subscription"
rosettastone,3,0,"there are a lot of issues with the microphone, i have to skin almost all the pronunciation lessons when i am outside."
rosettastone,3,0,maybe a stop recording would help.
rosettastone,3,4,maybe i haven't figured out the system yet but i have a hard time with the translation.
rosettastone,3,4,a picture is shown with no english equivalent so through trial and error i figure out which random phrase goes with the picture.
rosettastone,3,4,"the drops pp will show a picture, tell it too you in english, then give you the new language equivalent."
rosettastone,3,0,my only complaint is that it's not really a free pp that you can upgrade to a premium service for.
rosettastone,3,7,"yes, we get the word we are learning along with audit & a photo; however, we are not given the word in our own language."
rosettastone,3,7,i am shown the word à¤à¤¾ in hind but not given the english translation for what the word is.
rosettastone,3,7,but i am not paying him... i am paying you guns nearly $200.
rosettastone,3,7,so give me the translation!!!!
rosettastone,3,1,"not having any issues, aside from my phone lagging trying to return to the home page during a lesson."
rosettastone,3,1,"but, my phone is one drop away from being garage."
rosettastone,3,14,"they skipped some very basic lessons, like the alphabet, and physics, and how the sentences are put together."
rosettastone,3,8,why the 3-stars even though i really like this?
rosettastone,3,8,because the up is a little lame on andros.
rosettastone,3,4,the pp is extremely frustration when it comes to pronunciation.
rosettastone,3,4,it says the word once and then just buzzed you if you say it wrong and wants you to try again without saying it to you again to help you get it right.
rosettastone,3,0,it goes a bit quick and doesn't give enough time for me to repeat but i like the format.
rosettastone,3,0,be clear on what you provide please
rosettastone,3,1,but i just got into reading the stories and i'm disappointed that there is no way to define certain words that you may not know.
rosettastone,3,1,i wish there was a way to define words in stories that it would be 5 stars easy.
rosettastone,3,0,"it's ok, but some free apes are better"
rosettastone,3,0,"i have on problem, the expensive access of this pp, i wish you could to make it free like domingo,this pp has a special advantages, no pp like it ,it very efficient, a great pp, i put a 3 stars not because its performance but because its expensive access"
rosettastone,3,0,it would be better if it did not start at such an advanced stage.
rosettastone,3,0,the speaking part also freeze or has trouble hearing a lot.
rosettastone,3,0,"for some reason i always fail, but dont think the program has failed me yet."
rosettastone,3,0,in my area i hear people speaking tagalog all of the time.
rosettastone,3,0,if you could reply and add these features i would be delighted to continue on this pp on learning great pp guns!
rosettastone,3,1,needs work on the gun it is easy to accidentally press an answer when trying to listen to pronunciation again.
rosettastone,3,1,the pp also like to crash clot in when trying to pronounciate words.
rosettastone,3,0,"its too good, but i cannot login or create new id."
rosettastone,3,0,"i wish that it would work with the alphabet first, then basic sets of words."
rosettastone,3,0,i really wish it didn't just june into the common social vocabulary.
rosettastone,3,8,have used computer and is where the mid will pick up what i'm saying (whether pronunciation was correct or not).
rosettastone,3,8,but on andros it just keeps saying i'm too loud.
rosettastone,3,8,there is no way to adjust the mid like the computer version.
rosettastone,3,339,its a good pp but i mean it gives you a monthly pay but you actually have to pay the whole price for the term its very irritating because i want to pay monthly.... due to the fact that i dont know how long it will take me to finish the course but i can and i dont want to have to pay a 6 month subscription if in donna finish in just 4 months or have to buy a 6 month and then not finish and have to buy the three month set only not to use the whole three month set
rosettastone,3,0,i feel that some written rules mixed in could help me understand better.
rosettastone,3,0,sometimes i finally get the right answer just by remembering what the wrong answer was rather than a full understanding the reason.
rosettastone,3,0,some of the images are difficult to make out on a small screen such as a smartphone.
rosettastone,3,0,"i have to repeat the same words constantly because the audit is ""too loud"" even though i'm in a dark, quiet room, and nobody is at home :"")."
rosettastone,3,0,"love the pp but it does not pick up the microphone at times even if i make a random noise, it does not register and i fail lessons."
rosettastone,3,0,please fix to register microphone sounds.
rosettastone,3,7,speech recognition is broken.
rosettastone,3,7,"how am i donna get to french four in high school without being able to say ""oui""."
rosettastone,3,7,but dont get it to improve your language skill i have learned nothing new and i got the month access.
rosettastone,3,1,it is frustration to have to log in every time i want to use it particularly when i am on the go.
rosettastone,3,0,much better on the computer version in my opinion.
rosettastone,3,0,many of the buttons on mobile are difficult to press without his-clinking such as the play button to hear something before selecting it.
rosettastone,3,6,very frustration.. you could repeat it exactly the same and it will king and tell you your wrong every time.
rosettastone,3,6,in not client at all but in not deaf and i know when in repeating something just as i heard it.
rosettastone,3,0,"i like it, but it lacks dark mode."
rosettastone,3,9,"learning a language, or in my case, learning a language shouldn't cost any money at all."
rosettastone,3,0,"2 lessons and then you have to pay to go farther, otherwise i would give it a better rating!"
rosettastone,3,4,it can be frustration not being able to pass a grammar because there are no explanations whatsoever.
rosettastone,3,4,why can't that at least be an option?
rosettastone,3,1,i would have given it 5 stars but at that price you are donna need to cash in 2 gold stars to help pay for it!
rosettastone,3,0,"it is cool but i can't see the rate for my lesson, i also look in my computer why i can't in my phone?"
rosettastone,3,0,it does not start with alphabet or pronunciation.
rosettastone,3,0,too expensive for me to even consider signing up.
rosettastone,3,0,but it also costs clot more.
rosettastone,3,1,needs improvement in voice recognition.
rosettastone,3,1,very expensive.
rosettastone,3,0,i like it but when i speak to the pp it never pick my voice up.
rosettastone,3,0,even with head phone in
rosettastone,3,3,the pp is incredibly inconsistent with capturing audit and the play button touch area is too small / inconsistent on elements where the containing element has a separate touch action
rosettastone,3,0,when i say the sentence or word it doesn't hear me.
rosettastone,3,0,the mid doesn't hear me say the language
rosettastone,3,0,"it's pretty good, but kind expensive, i wish there were more free courses or cheaper courses other than that pretty good overall"
rosettastone,3,0,good program the only downfall is not knowing what your learning in spanish means exactly in english they have pictures and ways to help you understand and you get the general idea but it would be easier to comprehend and really take it all in if you knew exactly what you were speaking or learning just having the pictures and having them help you pronounce the words isn't enough it would be nice if they had english cautioned somewhere along with the spanish to get an even better understanding.
rosettastone,3,0,but it is sad not to have the learning games in the pp.
rosettastone,3,20,i'm leaving a couple stars off strictly due to price.
rosettastone,3,0,"i like the concept of the pp but was dissatisfied and ended up meeting the pp when it did not have to, chichewa, rio or kuranko"
rosettastone,3,3,"from a up standpoint, it would be great if all the extended learning activities do not cause the pp to lock into landscape mode."
rosettastone,3,0,goes a little slow.
rosettastone,3,0,doesn't let you advance to your current level.
rosettastone,3,1,"i can't open webster from roseola stone, i don't understand what's wrong!"
rosettastone,3,0,not satisfied with the pp barely can understand the language.
rosettastone,3,2,"over rate, over prices, incomplete, has errors with no way to report them"
rosettastone,3,1,not able to always get a response when i press.
rosettastone,3,0,it would help if it had a vocabulary section with direct translation of each word and verbs
rosettastone,3,0,i wish there was some english once in a while to explain grammatical differences.
rosettastone,3,0,microphone freeze and does not take input.
rosettastone,3,0,i dont get it are you supposed to learn or buy all the lessons because in not doing that i dusted wanted to learn more spanish.
rosettastone,3,0,not bad.
rosettastone,3,1,can you help me with this?
rosettastone,3,0,i can log in on the web via my school webster but not the pp.
rosettastone,3,0,speech recognition needs work.
rosettastone,3,0,"my texas accent is kissing me, however i am learning through visual and auditory measures."
rosettastone,3,1,so far i like it but i wish it also told me the translation of the word in learning in my language so in not confused from time to time
rosettastone,3,0,log in issues via andros
rosettastone,3,0,expensive.
rosettastone,3,0,sure wish it would stop assuming me to rate it when i have multiple times
rosettastone,3,0,give recently started and give already advanced in french.
rosettastone,3,3,i did not like it only because it would start me off with spanish but i have never read or learned spanish before.
rosettastone,3,0,hi its nice but am sad be i can continue ..i can buy the level ð¢i can ..
rosettastone,3,0,i feel like it doesn't give you a more understanding of connect words.
rosettastone,3,0,for example how am i supposed to know jug means juice if you just give me a picture and 3 option.
rosettastone,3,0,no english translation during learning
rosettastone,3,0,you get half way through and have 2 pay
rosettastone,3,0,i hate that you have to pay to get the full access
rosettastone,4,1,"so far its a great pp their are clot of option to choose from and you get the first core lessons free before having to purchase anything not, only that but it is actually really helpful with being able to hear the word rather than just reading it and the fact that if you get some words wrong you dont have to worry about starting the whole lesson over there is an option to go back through once you finish to fix any mistakes, they also put the words you struggle with in to a revision lesson"
rosettastone,4,4,pp wont work with andros device?
rosettastone,4,2,"the only thing that i've found that's annoying to me, is the when it comes to the audit."
rosettastone,4,2,"when trying to say it back to them, you end up shouting at your phone and yet they tell you ""we are having trouble hearing you."""
rosettastone,4,2,"i completely understand that audit is hard to get into an pp, i just think the audit could be improved slightly."
rosettastone,4,2,"this review is not for hate on the creator, i just think improvement is needed in some places - which is okay!"
rosettastone,4,8,i wish the program had the words written in my native language too with the pictures so i will have a better understanding what the pictures meant.
rosettastone,4,8,"examples.. i sometimes have a hard time making the pictures out of it's a man for women, boy or girl, what are the person or persons are doing in the picture."
rosettastone,4,7,at times the voice recognition says i was perfect when i definitely want.
rosettastone,4,0,i don't know how the absolute beginner can keep up.
rosettastone,4,5,i wonder what developer improved in the program for last 12 years since i tried it last time.
rosettastone,4,5,"bags in programs, but there is no handy button to report current slide."
rosettastone,4,0,i'm older and find a little difficult to see some of the clues in the pictures on my cell.
rosettastone,4,10,so you would know that if you didn't pronounce a certain word correctly.
rosettastone,4,10,i'm a student though and i can't afford to pay for the full package.
rosettastone,4,10,or maybe a promotion.
rosettastone,4,78,"it is bit tough to get it going first, but once you get used to the system and how it works, i believe that it is quite effective in conversational practice."
rosettastone,4,78,"however, i wish that it can provide bit more depth translation of the words."
rosettastone,4,78,i am currently using goose translator to look up few words which can be confusing while learning.
rosettastone,4,1,"it's fixed, but that was weird."
rosettastone,4,1,same here the program today started to pitch i cannot access my plan.
rosettastone,4,1,i had to sign in again and looks like all my progress saved is gone.
rosettastone,4,1,"also the audit was struggling to use either with wired headphones, bluetooth or just my phone microphone."
rosettastone,4,1,it's stuck in office mode.
rosettastone,4,4,and i'm pretty sure the tongue common vernacular has change slightly in the last couple decades.
rosettastone,4,77,"it spends a long enough time on each lesson that it sticks, lots of different exercises which, & cool pronunciation rating my biggest grip is the lack of explanations."
rosettastone,4,77,"i wish they gave some background on the words, id like to be told how the grammar changes, the actual rules effecting the changes, and if the super literal translation is different from the regular convoy translation of it."
rosettastone,4,1,"beware however: while speech recognition works a treat on my phone (honor 9), it's pretty horrendous on my malbrook for some reason."
rosettastone,4,0,"however, i mess some guidance on what we are really learning on each slide."
rosettastone,4,0,"i think if they highlight the variation in the gene, conjunction or whatever, it would be a little bit better."
rosettastone,4,2,though i'd prefer it to allow me time to translate what i just said before it moved on.
rosettastone,4,2,"the program kind pushes you through really fast, which is nice."
rosettastone,4,2,"you just have to go back to the lessons you didn't pass, even though it pips the next one up."
rosettastone,4,1,"there is a free version with limited use and adds, it will bug you to buy the premium thing but you dont have to."
rosettastone,4,1,"it will give you new words without a definition, but your allowed to look at the translation."
rosettastone,4,1,the only disadvantage i have about it is that you don't have a real translation and pictures what the words/sentences mean.
rosettastone,4,0,"i like how it helps breaks the words down, and uses pictures, but it would be great if their was more definition as to what the words are translated into english"
rosettastone,4,2,i wish it made more of an emphasis on the grammar.
rosettastone,4,2,coming from english we have a structure from the basis.
rosettastone,4,2,"need a little more theory in there, otherwise, i like it"
rosettastone,4,0,"sometimes has trouble hearing me even if i talk directly into the phone, but this doesn't happen often."
rosettastone,4,5,"great, but after almost completing the first beginning session, it cleared everything and now in back at the very beginning."
rosettastone,4,5,i hope this does not happen again :-(
rosettastone,4,1,occasional stitches but always fixed quickly.
rosettastone,4,2,"excellent, but needs an option to rest all lessons, not just one at a time which is too cumbersome when wanting to start after a period away"
rosettastone,4,2,everytime i close the pp on my phone it removed the plan i was doing and then i have to start up the plan again when i open the pp again.
rosettastone,4,1,familiar with the pp since desktop!
rosettastone,4,1,although had some minor bags during plan selection.
rosettastone,4,1,it's good but the english translation to the phrases will help people learn faster along with the pictures
rosettastone,4,0,have some bags with timing.
rosettastone,4,0,in the past you could slow the pronunciation.
rosettastone,4,0,"just started..wish i could tell it when to stop listening..after i say ""ll come"" if there background noise the mid will just stay on forever..wish i could stop the mid after i speak"
rosettastone,4,0,i could have download this without the guild education system giving me a link to download the free pp.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish it would have the english words to match.
rosettastone,4,3,"as good as can be expected with a cell phone, in terms of voice recognition and technology functionality."
rosettastone,4,0,i would give 5 stars when my script settings (hiraganas) will be saved so i don't have kansas when i re open the pp :'(
rosettastone,4,1,love it but personally would rather with the basic lessons also repeating back in my language but otherwise fantastic pp.
rosettastone,4,0,some trouble with the mid but that's part for the course with this phone so not the apes fault
rosettastone,4,0,just finished the first lesson but it seems good.
rosettastone,4,0,"i wish they gave definitions rather than pictures only, but we'll see what happens."
rosettastone,4,0,mostly good only issue that i'm having is occasionally the pp/ or phone is not picking up what i say
rosettastone,4,0,i'm learning arabic but there's different dialect in arabic wish they had them but still pretty easy to use
rosettastone,4,0,.oh only wish in could lean the english version of it in order to know what the word connection are.
rosettastone,4,4,some issues with mapping things and delays trying to hear certain things again.
rosettastone,4,4,"on some of the speaking activities it refuses to play the statement again, and on some activities it is playing the statement for the first picture twice and not the first then second picture."
rosettastone,4,4,"so few minor bags, but the pp is helpful if you can get by those!"
rosettastone,4,5,aug 19 - given 4 stars as sometimes voice recognition isn't accurate.
rosettastone,4,5,also please add the games available on the computer available in the pp also?
rosettastone,4,5,update nov 19 - in 3 months i have improved my vocabulary a lot.
rosettastone,4,5,great to now be able to access stories/record my voice reading but there's a pitch on playback as the highlight select random word left to right when hebrew is read right to left so doesn't correlate at all.
rosettastone,4,5,"also, please make the desktop games available on the pp!"
rosettastone,4,0,i wish they ask if i like it 3 months from when i got it so i can give a good honest review : )
rosettastone,4,0,suddenly unable to log in to the andros pp
rosettastone,4,0,but its good though.
rosettastone,4,88,"the pp is very professional and reaches you many phrases from the beginning, but can be challenging at the start too."
rosettastone,4,3,i like that because it shows the relationship between the characters.
rosettastone,4,6,"i think for languages with a non organized script (like in my case greek and chinese) a bit of previous work elsewhere is needed (in my case with domingo and lingodeer) before using roseola, and maybe a source for consulting grammar points, but with those caverns, roseola is excellent for improving listening and pronunciation."
rosettastone,4,3,but i wish their was an auditory only component i could do in the car.
rosettastone,4,3,"and if there's too much background noise, then the pp incorrectly marks wrong my pronunciation."
rosettastone,4,3,no english even needed!
rosettastone,4,2,"i like it, but i don't care for how it doesn't explain anything."
rosettastone,4,2,i just prefer having an english explanation for some things.
rosettastone,4,2,had some issues with the pronunciation.
rosettastone,4,2,wish it had an easier way to learn how to say words like break it down using the english alphabet for us english speakers learning a new language that uses characters instead of letters
rosettastone,4,8,the lessons are taught in a manner where you see your language you want to learn in its foreign writing.
rosettastone,4,8,also pictures to help you associate the words better.
rosettastone,4,8,"you are grade by a green wheel on how well you pronounce , and a green check if you pick the right picture to the words you are trying to learn."
rosettastone,4,10,the interface is very easy to use and the lessons agent very in-your-face about whether or not you get the answer right.
rosettastone,4,10,if i could recommend something to make the pp better i would say to put in more grammar stuff.
rosettastone,4,20,i like how it helps with the pronunciation.
rosettastone,4,20,that said some of the sentences the pp wants you to repeat are a little long for me to remember all the sounds and correct tongue positions.
rosettastone,4,20,i wish there was a setting where i could just work on individual words first or putting 2 maybe 3 words together.
rosettastone,4,20,i use it in conjunction with 2 other flash card type apes.
rosettastone,4,0,a little prices but helps a lot.
rosettastone,4,13,the only thing that others me is that i have completed one of the sections multiple times and it will not pass me and it says that its completed.
rosettastone,4,13,which i know sounds minor but every time i log it it takes me right back to several lessons ago and i have to skin.
rosettastone,4,7,"they work on how to say it, makes sure you don't get mixed up with different words, and they cover different words"
rosettastone,4,8,"the pace is really good for learning new words, and the voice recognition is really accurate."
rosettastone,4,8,"i wish it taught more of a lesson plan sometimes on why words are different, like masculine or feminine adjective."
rosettastone,4,7,"it is pretty great, expect for the fact that you have to kind guess what the picture is saying."
rosettastone,4,49,i'd give this a 3.5 but that's not an option ð however!
rosettastone,4,49,now femme break it down nice and simple.
rosettastone,4,0,its helping me learn the language.the only negative feedback i can say is that there is no english translation so i have to search a lot of words or sentence to completely understand a phrase or sentence.
rosettastone,4,10,once in a while i have had problems with speech recognition.
rosettastone,4,10,the one downside is there is no explanation on verb forms.
rosettastone,4,10,i wish they had a lesson on verbs only.
rosettastone,4,54,"although most of the new words can be understood with context clues, i wish the pp offered a translation dictionary to double check yourself."
rosettastone,4,54,"also, in spanish, i wish it better explained formal vs. informal word usage and synonymous words."
rosettastone,4,54,"for instance, when to use tu vs. used and her vs. star."
rosettastone,4,44,the only downside is that on my computer download there's a section to practice writing the words and i don't have that on the pp.
rosettastone,4,3,i have the then Â£300 copy for pp and want particularly happy when the pp came along and required further payment to take the experience mobile.
rosettastone,4,3,the pp is pretty much lawless but sometimes has issues with office content.
rosettastone,4,13,"would be useful if there was a tool box on the side to click on, which would tell us what a particular word means, if we are ensure."
rosettastone,4,1,the only issue is that i need to record what i learn by cooling terms so i know the true definitions.
rosettastone,4,0,i'd say getting a brand new phone or using a good microphone would indefinitely help.
rosettastone,4,0,going through core does not show romance or ilyin when learning how to pronounce words.
rosettastone,4,0,makes me wonder if i have the right pronunciation or if i am just muddying the words.
rosettastone,4,1,i dont like that to have to pay for all the features and they could add more features to the free version but its still very good for learning new languages.
rosettastone,4,0,it goes kind of fast and doesn't really say what kind of sound you're trying to make: b vs. v for example.
rosettastone,4,1,wish you could allow the sides to stay a dew seconds longer so we remember what we just did.
rosettastone,4,1,if they could put buzz lingo on it i would never do anything else.
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes the speech recognition does not work accurately.
rosettastone,4,0,"great experience, just sometimes can pick up my voice well"
rosettastone,4,0,it seems like the pp has trouble understanding me even when i pronounce the words correctly which results in a lower score.
rosettastone,4,5,"however, the cost is pretty high, there would be many more regular regular subscribers if there were a more reasonable price for us."
rosettastone,4,1,the pictures and repetition mean i really absorb the content.
rosettastone,4,1,"i only wish that it would explain the grammar more, as in why the grammar is different i certain situations."
rosettastone,4,1,could be better on pronunciation screens.
rosettastone,4,1,a little frustration when you know you're saying it properly and it's not recognizing it.
rosettastone,4,1,it's a bit frustration when it doesn't recognize the word i'm trying to say though.
rosettastone,4,1,"monthly payment option softens the blow (1 payment each month), please consider that."
rosettastone,4,0,they still haven't gone through the alphabet... which makes no sense to me... but otherwise i'm flying through
rosettastone,4,0,i can practice on the commune home!
rosettastone,4,0,the immense learning technique gave me n opportunity to under stand english.
rosettastone,4,0,intuition interface and sound teaching practices but some of the art could be better
rosettastone,4,0,"it just runs a little clung on sonya devices (peri, tablets, etc)"
rosettastone,4,0,"sometimes really podgy about picking up voice (like, just refuses to hear you, regardless of what you're saying) but other than that it's a great pp"
rosettastone,4,0,because it's not all free but zero defects
rosettastone,4,0,a four only in that it is immersion and having a tough time connecting the dots.
rosettastone,4,0,some hints on purity and fiction in early stages might help in particular with non-neuro based language.
rosettastone,4,4,"easy to learn, good for beginners but would be good if you didn't need to repeat activities if you got them all correct in the core activities!"
rosettastone,4,0,i love the experience and the ability to learn from this pp the only thing i wish was different is for there to be a way to earn more lessons or even just the ability to get the lessons cheaper.
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes the mid just refuses to pick up any sound.
rosettastone,4,0,i love the pp the only thing wrong is it doesn't really teach the basic first.
rosettastone,4,0,the translation part doesn't always work but it's still an awesome pp.
rosettastone,4,0,you dont necessarily need it
rosettastone,4,0,good but often doesn't hear me speak with the phone just inches away.
rosettastone,4,0,a little trouble with the voice recognition sometimes but not enough to cause any real difficulty
rosettastone,4,0,it is good for my daughter but it gave her words and sentences in spanish but didn't translate to what it was in english to know what she was learning or saying
rosettastone,4,0,the pp helps me with japanese but the mid dont pick up my japanese.
rosettastone,4,0,ply work on the mid.
rosettastone,4,0,my only consolation is that on mobile the text is often very small.
rosettastone,4,0,the voice recognition needs improvement though.
rosettastone,4,0,thinking about doing the purchased version.
rosettastone,4,0,4 because i can't listen to music at the same time but a good pp.
rosettastone,4,0,speech recognition on a phone could be better though
rosettastone,4,0,very good but not free
rosettastone,4,0,it said i learned 16 new words from just the first lesson but i only know what about 5 of them mean
rosettastone,4,0,"overall quite good, just speech recognition is sometimes not recognizing and then annoying"
rosettastone,4,0,i wish we didn't get penalized for answering questions on images that are based on one's interpretation
rosettastone,4,0,i wish there was some english direction though
rosettastone,4,0,"pretty good, wish i could get to the level in already at and go from there but the beginning stages are a good refreshed"
rosettastone,4,0,"the pp does work well, yet it sometimes says you pronounced a word wrong even if you said it the same way it said it"
rosettastone,4,0,!its just a bit hard... anyway i'm learning japanese and it's fun!
rosettastone,4,0,certain images are too small when using on a phone - have to resort to guessing
rosettastone,4,0,just wish we didn't have to pay.
rosettastone,4,0,but i wish you let your users try until they get it correct.
rosettastone,4,0,wish it was free.
rosettastone,4,0,it's great but i wish the lessons to buy were less expensive
rosettastone,4,0,"great tool, but does not immediately teach you the basic travel survival words."
rosettastone,4,0,there is no translation in non paid pack
rosettastone,4,0,great but need english translation...!
rosettastone,4,0,i wish it was like domingo (can be used without money)
rosettastone,4,0,wish i could repeat it over and over to ensure retention.
rosettastone,4,0,pronouncing difficult very limited could give more time to pronounce words
rosettastone,4,0,i am not able to find the option to change from beginner to intermediate on my pp.
rosettastone,4,14,"however, it is so repetition, and each lesson can get boring after a while."
rosettastone,4,14,"i feel like as if you have the lesson settings switched to ""normal"" mode, you might miss practicing some key grammar or pronunciation skill, however if you have it set to the ""extended"" setting it becomes way too repetition and easy after a while."
rosettastone,4,14,i've got my fingers crossed the developer can one day make a more challenging mode.
rosettastone,4,0,"the desktop version until recently was programme in the flash standard, which is being retired next year."
rosettastone,4,0,"i guess i either need better enunciation or a better mid, but i will update rating accordingly."
rosettastone,4,3,"but, my biggest issue with your program is at times i know what pictures to match up but, not a clue what it actually means."
rosettastone,4,0,can use it office.
rosettastone,4,0,the mobile pp is a little confusing to navigable to get to your next lesson.
rosettastone,4,0,there is more than one to navigable to the lessons i choose.
rosettastone,4,0,the th star will come once i can test out my language skill to hold conversations with others.
rosettastone,4,0,"the pp is good but i would like to see the ""play"" button get an increase in size."
rosettastone,4,0,its easy to mist and get the question wrong when you just want to listen to all of the answers
rosettastone,4,4,"only downside i have so far, i have the sensitivity fairly low on pronunciation & often it says it can't hear me, background too loud, or volume too high."
rosettastone,4,4,"also, occasionally a little tricky to follow what or how i'm supposed to be answer."
rosettastone,4,0,"for one language, you can subscribe or buy lifetime use."
rosettastone,4,0,the voice recognition system is the only thing that i don't like.
rosettastone,4,0,"sometimes, i have to scream it."
rosettastone,4,0,"and half of the time, i can speak normally."
rosettastone,4,0,i do not have this problem with domingo.
rosettastone,4,0,"i know that it's not my pronunciation because i'll say it the exact same way, but at varying volume levels and get practically different results."
rosettastone,4,0,this happens when i'm alone in a room with no background noise whatsoever.
rosettastone,4,3,the pictures really help to associate words with meaning and the voice shows you how to pronounce the words correctly.
rosettastone,4,3,"you jump right into conversation without learning the basic words and structure of the language first, which is how immersion learning works i guess, but i feel like it helps that i have had some spanish classes in the past."
rosettastone,4,0,the audit analysis is great at telling you when you've not pronounced a word correctly however it's not great at helping you improve.
rosettastone,4,1,the only fault i have found is sometimes they speak too fast and it would be nice to slow it down to hear the pronunciation better.
rosettastone,4,1,"i know they want to totally immense you in the language, but if i can't understand each word/sound, then all i am getting is frustrated, not educated."
rosettastone,4,5,"great pp, bit expensive and it is limited in that once you've done the 20 units that's it, nothing more."
rosettastone,4,5,tried to sign up on their webster but due to some pitch could subscribe.
rosettastone,4,5,contracted customer service but what seemed to me an automatic reply.
rosettastone,4,12,"otherwise, your stuck with learning what eating, running, and reading are in french."
rosettastone,4,3,what i don't like it there is no definition section to look up a word.
rosettastone,4,3,at my computer and use the same account.
rosettastone,4,3,it has to be all on my phone which makes it hard for me to stay focused.
rosettastone,4,3,i wish roseola stone would let you use the account with another device.
rosettastone,4,0,clashes itself or boots my whole goose fixed 2 every time i try to create an account or log in.
rosettastone,4,0,***** update: the bug was from my phone trying to launch in portrait mode rather than landscape.
rosettastone,4,0,good customer service when i pulled up the chat and started trouble shooting.
rosettastone,4,5,"when trying to press the play button on mobile it is super easy to accidentally select the bubble as your answer instead of pressing the ""play"" button."
rosettastone,4,5,i even tried using a status and still occasionally selected the wrong answer when i was just trying to hear the option spoken out loud.
rosettastone,4,5,"while i do love the zero english, i do think some direct translations would help on occasion."
rosettastone,4,0,"the only issue i ever have is minor, when it comes to speaking the language, sometimes it does not clearly determine what i said."
rosettastone,4,8,i have occasionally used goose translate to figure out the finer grammatical details.
rosettastone,4,0,"i give it 4 stars because every single lesson you finish, it asks if you want to rate the pp."
rosettastone,4,0,"i can tell you from experience it will only allow you to leave one rating, but once you've left a rating it will never stop asking if you like to leave another."
rosettastone,4,0,might as well never rate at all if you can make the message go away either way.
rosettastone,4,0,"although, i'd like it if there was english before, so it can tell us what that word or sentence is then go away at a later time."
rosettastone,4,0,or at least a button for people who wanted it.
rosettastone,4,0,and you can change your language daytime you want and it'll save your progress on the other language.
rosettastone,4,4,"a bit on the expensive side, but if you can get a half price deal i'd say it's worth it."
rosettastone,4,4,"i recommend learning in conjunction with an audit program to get additional speaking practise in (with makarin, it's all about the intonation)."
rosettastone,4,1,not having a translation into english really challenges the brain to think of what is meant in the pictures and that can be misleading at times.
rosettastone,4,1,"it makes the lesson a bit more difficult to understand but when you get it, it stays with you"
rosettastone,4,1,"it is amazing but falling short of the rest of the features no games (games in the web version could be expanded to more than a handful) no public chat no multiplayer/person some of the display isn't inconvenient, appearing tiny, when you have an image to match words."
rosettastone,4,2,good but speech recognition could use some fine tuning to work well with car bluetooth device.
rosettastone,4,2,it can barely hear me speaking so it marks the answer wrong.
rosettastone,4,2,"speech recognition is the best thing to practice in the car since it allows for hands free training and i can keep my eyes on the road, just listen and speak...well if it worked well it would be the best training."
rosettastone,4,5,my only problem is that the pronunciation portions are a little itchy.
rosettastone,4,5,i will be in a silent room and it will tell me that audit is too loud?
rosettastone,4,5,also feel like the basis should be more about letters and bowels than actual questions in the other language.
rosettastone,4,5,i have no idea what i'm saying even with the pictures sometimes.
rosettastone,4,0,"i really am enjoying the pp,, the only problem i have is that the pictures are too small when they're comparing places if you need glasses and they introduce words without telling you what they mean but other than that the pp is it wonderful."
rosettastone,4,0,i also had a problem that customer service was able to fix promptly and courteously .
rosettastone,4,2,"it can be frustration because it is completely immersion and without translations it is sometimes difficult to know exactly what i'm learning, but it makes it better in the long run."
rosettastone,4,36,"i made an account for the japanese unit and my only issues is sometimes, the voice lessons don't work and you have to start the pp."
rosettastone,4,36,the other issue is that you can only do unit 1 without paying money.
rosettastone,4,36,it actually works and helps me learn the verbs and grammar of the target language without explanation.
rosettastone,4,10,"the only thing i dont like is that sometimes it's not always 100% clear what something means as it doesn give u a direct translation, but rather pictures."
rosettastone,4,8,"i do like this, my only need is to have the ability to see what you learned in each section so you can review it without needing to go over already completed work."
rosettastone,4,8,"like chapter reviews of the things you learned in a list, sentences and vocal."
rosettastone,4,8,"also i think the jayshree needs to changed to allow pelt to choose if they want to learn with full anti, or just kann (hiragana/katakana) only and romance."
rosettastone,4,8,the full anti didn't bother me as i'm not a beginner.
rosettastone,4,8,you should never use english when studying any language.
rosettastone,4,0,"however, i find that some of the translations (in organ) don't match the picture?"
rosettastone,4,0,"like, it can say ""ì¬ìê° of ë§ì´ì¬"" which means, the woman is eating r i c e, but the picture shows a woman eating spaghetti?"
rosettastone,4,0,"i might be understanding it wrong, but in pretty sure i'm right."
rosettastone,4,0,"this is the awesome pp, but it's too slow...i mean when i do excesses all the same repeats again and again, i need more diversity during 1 unit."
rosettastone,4,0,and the speaker repeat a phrase before and after i inserted a word.
rosettastone,4,10,"i got it to learn more english well and work on my pronunciation, so far i think it is working, the only down side is that you can't log onto another device until you log out in your other device."
rosettastone,4,10,i use this pp with my lawton the most and there has been instances where i forgets to log out and can't use the pp during my lunch at work on my phone or tablet.
rosettastone,4,10,i don't like that it can't be opened on multiple devices.
rosettastone,4,15,"unless you have a professional level microphone, it will tell you that you failed the first time, but upon saying the word or phrase a second time, it will say you got it 100% correct."
rosettastone,4,1,"i do wish there was more help with pronunciation, like if i get a word wrong repetitively, i'd like to be given the option for extra physics help."
rosettastone,4,1,"also would be nice to have a ""general grammar rule"" section to reference for help."
rosettastone,4,76,"the only problem i have with it so far is, in the early portions of the program, it doesn't directly tell you what any of the words mean."
rosettastone,4,1,"i like it a lot and it is really helpful to visualized and pronounce these words, but without telling you the definitions it can be difficult."
rosettastone,4,1,you never know if you are perceiving it wrong and therefore learning the language wrong.
rosettastone,4,1,"especially in the beginning, you don't want to mess up the basis."
rosettastone,4,0,a brief and clarifying explanation will be helpful in addition to just showing pictures to make us have a firm grasp of the grammar lessons.
rosettastone,4,0,i personally find learning grammar by scanning pictures a bit hard.
rosettastone,4,1,"my biggest and only issue like others have mentioned, it will pick and choose when it wants to hear me."
rosettastone,4,1,"i use a bone heads in a silent room, it'll say i'm mispronouncing/can't hear me say easy words, or as someone else mentioned during the pronunciation exercises it acts up (like it has trouble recognizing the word parts when it tries to break them down), but doesn't have trouble picking up the complex stuff."
rosettastone,4,0,you can pause.
rosettastone,4,0,you can keep trying until you get 100%.
rosettastone,4,0,"sometimes it refuses to accept your pronunciation as accurate even when it's for something as simple as ""ah."""
rosettastone,4,0,it also sometimes takes awhile to register your pronunciation so you are left waiting to see if you were correct.
rosettastone,4,5,i wish the way the pp presented lessons was a little more streamlined.
rosettastone,4,5,"you start with a daily lesson plan, but once that is finished, you no longer have a prescribed daily goal."
rosettastone,4,5,"be careful to not sign up for the deceptive ""3 month trial"" it is only 3 days in the fine print and you will get charged sooner than you think!"
rosettastone,4,4,many verbs have different endings than others but i am slowly catching on.
rosettastone,4,4,hoping for lessons that not only have you say and match pictures.
rosettastone,4,4,also this pp has a hard time hearing me.
rosettastone,4,4,i dont have a big bulky case on my phone anymore for this reason.
rosettastone,4,209,"the zero translation and repetition until it sticks seems to work best for me even if it can feel a little tedious at the time, it's still fun to use."
rosettastone,4,0,i do wish there was a section where i could just learn all the root verbs and conversations using the same format and technique they use for vocal and grammar in general.
rosettastone,4,0,occasionally difficult with voice recognition (seems to work better if i speak loudly).
rosettastone,4,15,be sure to know basic hiragana and katakana before starting.
rosettastone,4,15,"i would not advise getting this if you have never studied, though."
rosettastone,4,4,it can be frustration at times because the voice recognition has trouble with my southern accent i think.
rosettastone,4,4,there are also instances where the program doesn't recognize that i have completed a lesson and this requires repeating it.
rosettastone,4,4,not necessarily a bad thing because a review is helpful.
rosettastone,4,2,"i love the pp, and it's valuable for learning grammar and vocabulary; the pronunciation exercises, however, are useless, because despite doing everything support suggests, it won't register my voice properly."
rosettastone,4,2,"it also has a bug in which it gives me a full green circle for pronouncing the words/sounds correctly, but then marks me wrong."
rosettastone,4,2,update: still no fix to the pronunciation exercise bags.
rosettastone,4,3,the approach to teaching with complete immersion will work if i can stick with it.
rosettastone,4,3,it's repetition but i think that is the way they get you to know the words and make it second nature to you.
rosettastone,4,0,(but!!)
rosettastone,4,10,"i really like it, just wish it had all the bells and whistles after you buy it for your phone but apparently not all lessons are compatible(teach support told me this) and i thought to myself.. self, if you just paid for that language (not free version) shouldn i be able to do all the lessons or least be able to login on pp an do it but if you go that route you have to buy it again."
rosettastone,4,0,i wish if the pronunciation was less than their 100% or full circle that they would give you the option to try again.
rosettastone,4,0,i really wish there was a strictly audit segment that could be used while driving.
rosettastone,4,0,i was specifically told i could use while driving by roseola stone customer support.
rosettastone,4,51,"i am annoyed by bad word-splitting; e.g., ""ophanayim"" has the first letter (slept) alone on top line: it would have fit well on the next... or use a bigger button."
rosettastone,4,10,speech recognition works well.
rosettastone,4,10,no clashes or delayed response in lessons.
rosettastone,4,10,but some lessons seem not optimized for phone size as pictures seem too small or his allied with caution bubbles.
rosettastone,4,0,could do with an additional vocabulary builder.
rosettastone,4,2,i only wish the pp could work in portrait mode.
rosettastone,4,2,there is no reason to force it into landscape.
rosettastone,4,2,"update: the selection interface is now portrait, one more effort to bring the lessons in portrait mode too!"
rosettastone,4,45,the one thing i would like is if they would have an english translation and not just show you the foreign language by itself.
rosettastone,4,45,that would help me with the grammar.
rosettastone,4,45,"also, you're not able to do the writing lessons on your phone."
rosettastone,4,45,"over all though, it is very helpful and keeps me on track."
rosettastone,4,6,pretty good but i think it starts at a weird place ??
rosettastone,4,6,i wish they also translated what it all meant weather just have us guess ??
rosettastone,4,1,the only reason the pp is not five stars is because every once in a while it won't register my voice.
rosettastone,4,1,so i either fail or have to say a phrase or word multiple times for it to register.
rosettastone,4,22,often there are issues with the pictures and the subject that properly needs to be addressed when firing out what exactly needs to be said or chosen.
rosettastone,4,22,for example there a mon and a boy pointing at a woman in a car.
rosettastone,4,22,if the picture is small its very unclear what in looking at.
rosettastone,4,0,"but when you have to pronounce the words, i suggest you go to a very quiet room so the pp can understand you."
rosettastone,4,0,the core lessons are fine but what really others me is the pronunciation feature.
rosettastone,4,0,even for easy syllables (like 'ba') the pp will still say you pronounced it incorrectly.
rosettastone,4,0,that others me.
rosettastone,4,1,in only on lesson 2. i am familiar with japanese.
rosettastone,4,1,"i do feel like the multiple choice makes it easy to make educated guesses, but maybe it works out in the long run."
rosettastone,4,1,"every time i open the pp it says congratulations on finishing week, even though i'm on week 3. there's a button that takes me to my latest though so it's not too much of a bother, but still weird."
rosettastone,4,13,i originally bought a d from for home but now with smartphones and the lack of a d drive in my newer computers i felt a subscription would be more useful.
rosettastone,4,13,the content is the same but in a much easier to access format here.
rosettastone,4,88,"i like the pp, i just always dread the pronunciation lessons because it doesn't register my voice very well."
rosettastone,4,88,no issues with my phone that would cause this problem.
rosettastone,4,88,"i just don't get 100% on every pronunciation lesson which is fine, just a bit annoying hata."
rosettastone,4,1,i love that you start by actually speaking and connecting what you hear and say to images.
rosettastone,4,1,my only complaint is the requirement for long term subscriptions.
rosettastone,4,1,i would prefer a single month option to start.
rosettastone,4,9,my only constructive feedback would be help with when pronunciation is incorrect... sometimes it's hard to know what to change/ fix or how to shape my mouth so i end up telling at my phone hata
rosettastone,4,0,would have given a five star if you actually gave a translation.
rosettastone,4,0,"it would be useless to learn to speak, but at the same time not know the meaning."
rosettastone,4,1,but without translation sometimes it seems difficult.
rosettastone,4,1,on mobile the size of the pictures is small and sometimes it is difficult to know the context .
rosettastone,4,0,i like how its giving attempts to pronounce and showing what part your saying from the sentence.
rosettastone,4,5,"in pronunciation exercises, it does leave a mispronounced word prayed out, but doesn't usually prompt you to re-pronounce the missed word if the rest of the phrase is correct."
rosettastone,4,5,i haven't figured out how to go back and fix the pronunciation on the missed word.
rosettastone,4,0,the speech recognition is spot though.
rosettastone,4,0,immersing works for me
rosettastone,4,18,"give yourself time though, i found one unit a week was a sensible target."
rosettastone,4,0,"my only issue is using the microphone on my lawton, it doesn't work most of the time."
rosettastone,4,0,"i granted the roseola stone webster access but still not working, and i end up using the pp on my phone instead."
rosettastone,4,3,i rate it a 4 because it has to be completely quiet in order for the microphone to only hear you.
rosettastone,4,3,"no one else can talk, no music, or background noise."
rosettastone,4,1,"enjoying the pp and its great that it can help with pronunciation, but it can be frustration because often it doesn seem to hear me."
rosettastone,4,0,unfortunately my language course stopped the licence so in moving onto a if pp.
rosettastone,4,2,i really like roseola stone because they teach you how you pronounce the words but i just wish that they gave you an actual schedule to follow that shows what you should do everyday because i have found some other things on the pp that i didn't even know were there or when to use them.
rosettastone,4,5,"some explanation on the differences in phrases (il= he, is= they) would help & its not allowing me to access the ""free"" lessons after the and lesson."
rosettastone,4,8,i wish it would teach all of the characters first instead if just throwing them at you from the start.
rosettastone,4,8,especially the anti.
rosettastone,4,8,and give tried pronouncing mass and a bunch of other stuff but it keeps saying i'm wrong even though i'm pronouncing it correctly.
rosettastone,4,8,sometimes i have to scream or make my voice higher to make it work.
rosettastone,4,0,"more interactive, work on conversation actually saying the words, like the speaking analyse so know saying it right."
rosettastone,4,0,just need to have short note why something right or wrong answer in grammar.
rosettastone,4,2,i find myself more of a visual learner and i had to find a pronunciation guide to organ letters before i could actually read or say the words on the exercises.
rosettastone,4,0,"love learning with this, my only complaint at the moment is i wish i could get translations to what i was saying to go along with the pictures."
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes it is hard to tell what is meant by the picture alone.
rosettastone,4,0,hope there will be an option for monthly subscription to all languages.
rosettastone,4,0,"the lessons are getting harder, but the curve is a gentle one."
rosettastone,4,6,great but needs translations.
rosettastone,4,0,"very easy to press the wrong choice instead of the pronunciation aid, so the i has a little further to go."
rosettastone,4,0,"the voice recognition is ok, but can sometimes be infuriatingly off."
rosettastone,4,1,power some spanish words it doesn explain what they are and a suggestion would be to have an ex.
rosettastone,4,1,of an english word that would sound like the accent when the person gets it wrong.
rosettastone,4,0,overall good pp but a bit expensive if you dont get one of the discount they offer once in a while.
rosettastone,4,2,"some things could be improved, for instance the time after you get an answer correct is too slow mio."
rosettastone,4,2,"it forces me to be patient, give us an option to not see the slow fades / animation"
rosettastone,4,0,"however the speaking software is a bit buggy and doesn't always ""hear"" what you're saying."
rosettastone,4,7,"i love the repeated after me effect in the lessons, it helps you pronunciation."
rosettastone,4,7,i gave them fours stars because you have to pay for the other lessons and they are quite expensive.
rosettastone,4,1,however there is no help feature that i can find that allows the program to explain why something has changed.
rosettastone,4,8,the program has a difficult time with speech recognition during exercises requiring me to respond verbally.
rosettastone,4,0,combined pronouncing with vocabulary and grammar.
rosettastone,4,9,the vocabulary is great it breaks it down for you but they don't give you enough time to write the words down.
rosettastone,4,9,"nor do they explain what the pictures are showing in english, that would help coralate some of the words."
rosettastone,4,0,perhaps by the time i finish the repetition will make it stick.
rosettastone,4,2,"the pp is good, but think it would be better for my learning if the speakers would slow down some."
rosettastone,4,2,i would also like to to have time to practice the words and phrases.this would give me time to practice and respond.
rosettastone,4,1,the only challenge being i would prefer for example in learning chinese i would prefer a translation to my language lets say english so that i could understand more than just learning from pictures.
rosettastone,4,0,good program but expensive.
rosettastone,4,0,please add sign languageð
rosettastone,4,1,would be nice if there were some guideline rules on how the structure of grammar works.
rosettastone,4,1,sometimes it can be difficult with out your native language direction
rosettastone,4,0,"the pp can be somewhat delayed sometimes and doesn't pick up the voice if there's too much background noise, other than that i love the learning."
rosettastone,4,0,the only complaint i have so far is that random it doesn hear or understand me speaking... no matter what i do.
rosettastone,4,3,"great pp to learn with, sometimes you can be left a little puzzled as the pp doesn't use types english so you are left guessing what the photo is."
rosettastone,4,0,"sometimes the mid doesn't pick up my voice, but i don't mind the repetition when learning a language."
rosettastone,4,0,but some time it can not recognize my void.
rosettastone,4,1,"some of the pronunciation has the letters on the wrong syllable, and i would give an option to study the alphabet with sounds, but other than that this is good so far."
rosettastone,4,0,it sticks with you clearly if you practice.
rosettastone,4,0,"i would love to learn norwegian from you, but i can't."
rosettastone,4,2,"does ask for money, but if you do it right you dont need to pay for anything."
rosettastone,4,1,"but it'd be better if there were basic alphabet of the languages, plus, the words' translation (from pictures) into our selected native language."
rosettastone,4,0,"so far so good, but sometimes the audit doesn't pick up very well no matter how close or far away the microphone is, or how loud or quietly i speak."
rosettastone,4,0,starts with basic but engaging exercises.
rosettastone,4,0,recognition skill develop quickly but pronunciation skill need more work.
rosettastone,4,6,"a few days in and have learned a bit, practicing vocabulary and such."
rosettastone,4,6,i wish more of the pp was in english or had toggleable translations for the words i'm trying to learn or the phrases as pictures aren't quite enough
rosettastone,4,1,one thing is that the practices are reparative.
rosettastone,4,0,the exercises are clear for the most part.
rosettastone,4,6,i love this program but sometimes the voice recognition does not work.
rosettastone,4,6,"it is not just with the pp, i have the same problem with the computer program."
rosettastone,4,0,mid doesn't always work.
rosettastone,4,0,not sure if it's my device or the pp.
rosettastone,4,0,"also, some of the situations are hard to tell what the pp is trying to ask."
rosettastone,4,0,"i think the pp is great for beginner work and using correct pronunciation but i wish it was simply more unfordable to continue further with this pp, but a must have for beginners"
rosettastone,4,1,this way i can start and stop my lessons based on time available.
rosettastone,4,1,i was failing at logging in on my computer.
rosettastone,4,2,i consider myself an intermediate user but you have to buy the entire plan or the lesson to get to that part of the pp.
rosettastone,4,0,"but needs abolishing on the way you repeat individual lessons, needs a retro button when you dont get the 100% without going to the next step."
rosettastone,4,1,"the only issue i have is that during pronunciation reviews, the program will random say it can't hear me."
rosettastone,4,2,time will tell.
rosettastone,4,0,great pp but some buttons and pictures could be bigger.
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes my county finger presses the wrong answer when i'm trying to reply the sound.
rosettastone,4,0,i am learning vietnamese some of the words don't mean the same thing.
rosettastone,4,0,it said that ong and ba is an older man or woman but i was corrected and told it's elderly man or woman.
rosettastone,4,4,but it would be nice if we can get it free on the phone pp as well so we can use it on the go.
rosettastone,4,2,"however, i wish it was a little slower transitioning to the next exercise so i can repeat what it said"
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes the recording feature malfunctions a little in terms of recognizing my voice or giving a grade.
rosettastone,4,0,it sometimes laws or doesn't register.
rosettastone,4,0,"great program, but poorly made pp, the play buttons are too small, near impossible to use without touching the answer button."
rosettastone,4,0,"it's easy to use and it gives instant feedback, but sometimes it might help to have a translation or explanation of the words."
rosettastone,4,3,wish there were more unfordable option
rosettastone,4,0,the only challenge is the speaking.
rosettastone,4,0,i'm certain that will come with time.
rosettastone,4,1,good pp and i am learning but wished picture were better.
rosettastone,4,1,makes it hard to answer when you can't see picture clearly.
rosettastone,4,2,"it's a great pp, but it doesn't seem to recognize the mid sometimes."
rosettastone,4,2,i find that i talk to it and it doesn't even pick up my voice... on a relatively new phone
rosettastone,4,0,it would be better for me if it focused on recreational words and phrases since my trip is for fun not business but it works
rosettastone,4,0,can't use the pp anymore since the last update.
rosettastone,4,0,when i want to start a lesson ist always says âerror - please try againâ.... liked it a lot before.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish i was able to play while there is absent noise.
rosettastone,4,0,but the mid does not differentiate my voice from background noise.
rosettastone,4,0,voice recognition is not always working well.
rosettastone,4,1,i love the no translation approach.
rosettastone,4,1,even without doing the initial into to explain it were able to figure what they were doing in the pictures.
rosettastone,4,0,having a slight issue with the speech recognition but overall i love the new format.
rosettastone,4,0,i think in career builder english mode it has not to force user spell exactly complete all paragraph in stories to pass .
rosettastone,4,0,please add choice to skin speaking .
rosettastone,4,0,it's great but expensive.
rosettastone,4,0,"great pp, but the speech recognition doesn register often and i'm stuck repeating words and phrases."
rosettastone,4,0,love the pp except even though you pronounce the words right it still fails you 50% of the time.
rosettastone,4,0,recommend using heads with mid.
rosettastone,4,0,paid service that reminds me of going through a textbook in a classroom.
rosettastone,4,0,some thumbnail photo are too small to be easily understood on a phone screen.
rosettastone,4,0,the audit says too loud and has a hard time recognizing my voice.
rosettastone,4,0,for some reason you can purchase classes in the pp.
rosettastone,4,0,"a little slower pace than i would like, but i like that it grades your pronunciation."
rosettastone,4,0,"good simple bite size learning you can fit around your day, hard to work out if the voice recognition issues are my microphone or the software."
rosettastone,4,0,4 stars only because the mobile doesn't include noweigen as an option yet!
rosettastone,4,16,in learning the nous and verbs of sentences but not exactly how to put them together except by use of phrases... which is how we learned as a kid (perhaps the main parts could be highlight) ... but through the next lesson i notice more parts of the sentence that seem subtle but now stand out to me at least with pronunciation... this feels promising.
rosettastone,4,0,good for speech doesn't always tell you the translations of the words which means the sometimes ambiguous pictures have to be deciphered.
rosettastone,4,0,but thought it was free.
rosettastone,4,0,but that's fine.
rosettastone,4,1,"i don't know what i am being charged, was sent three different prices."
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes the speaking and pronunciation isn clear but overall very well made and thought out.
rosettastone,4,0,"works pretty well on the mobile pp, just the occasional issue having to repeat into the mid."
rosettastone,4,0,i think the picture isn't enough.
rosettastone,4,0,they can do a lot better by adding exact english interpretation of the word in the studied language
rosettastone,4,1,"i love the learning experience, i just have issues with it freezing occasionally."
rosettastone,4,2,"good except buttons on andros are so small that when i try to hear speech, it submits it as my answer and i get it wrong."
rosettastone,4,0,"its a great pp the only issues i have had is with the mid,sometimes i doesn really understands what you are trying to say"
rosettastone,4,0,"good, though the way the immersion is used isn clear sometimes leading to confusion."
rosettastone,4,0,love the recognition feature that allows you to check your pronunciation at different levels as you improve.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish i could highlight words when in not sure of their meaning though
rosettastone,4,0,i would like the option to see the translation in english at any given time during the lessons.
rosettastone,4,2,i started using this pp to learn japanese for travel but i'm having issues fully understanding it just because it doesn't actually directly translate and tell me what each word means
rosettastone,4,5,then came the part where you had to pay for more lessons......not cool.
rosettastone,4,0,it breaks difficult words into syllables and sound to help.
rosettastone,4,1,"love the pp and does teach you stuff, also no adds, but very expensive to buy the full lessons."
rosettastone,4,0,"i like how reaches us, shows up the language in its own language."
rosettastone,4,0,would be nice to have links to grammar and vocabulary associated with each section.
rosettastone,4,0,everything is great but the only problem is that it laws with out internet sometimes with internet.
rosettastone,4,0,it's great for sight but i'm not sure on the audit side that i would be able to keep up in a conversation
rosettastone,4,0,i get some pronunciation correct but it says i did not.
rosettastone,4,0,"this pp helped me learn a ton while i lived in japan, though it doesn pick up on some pronunciation sometimes."
rosettastone,4,1,it helps out clot with the picture in with the text
rosettastone,4,2,the voice recognition is very problematical which slow down learning
rosettastone,4,0,let's you have the basic learning for free and the rest you need to pay to clock everything but its great ð
rosettastone,4,1,"really good, but the pronunciation part could use more of a breakdown."
rosettastone,4,0,i would later you 5 stars â¨ ð if it was free
rosettastone,4,4,but as i live in ran i can buy the premium and all access.
rosettastone,4,14,a bit frustration when it registers your pronunciation wrong.
rosettastone,4,1,should have english with the lesson so that people can know exactly what they are learning to say.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish they would say it in english and then spanish so i can see the words together
rosettastone,4,0,it goes fast into immersion but you can repeat the lessons until you feel comfortable moving on.
rosettastone,4,1,there should be a limestone option at the end of each unit.... like the pp version
rosettastone,4,0,"i really enjoy it, though sometimes it just doesn't register my voice"
rosettastone,4,2,i am doing g this on my smart phone the print is.rather small.
rosettastone,4,0,i like how it immersed you into the language from the start like you were in that country.
rosettastone,4,0,for the most part i enjoy the pp but the speech isn't always accurate
rosettastone,4,1,wish there were explanations/grammar rules/etc...
rosettastone,4,0,i want only hiragana not anti.
rosettastone,4,0,"very good, albeit phone mid sometime gets drowned out by fan and other common absent noise"
rosettastone,4,0,content of the pp somewhat depends on your language however you wont have trouble navigation the venus.
rosettastone,4,0,i love it a lot but they should had some more detail or explain some words or the meaning of it
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes the speech function doesn hear you.
rosettastone,4,6,roseola stone even explains grammar in the same way.
rosettastone,4,0,"kind fun, but make sure you have a decent internet connection"
rosettastone,4,0,previously rate 5 stars but the pp constantly asks for waiting even after give already rate it which is mildly annoying
rosettastone,4,0,"i love it except that the accuracy bar doesn display when you reply words your struggling with, with make me struggle more."
rosettastone,4,2,sometimes voice detection hangs/laws making me repeat the phrase or word.
rosettastone,4,0,interesting style in not giving a translation into english just pictures but it's great it helps you brain think
rosettastone,4,0,"enjoyed the interaction, made learning interesting."
rosettastone,4,0,great program but the pictures could be bigger
rosettastone,4,0,too much anti for the first lesson.
rosettastone,4,0,prefer more hiragana and katakana.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish they would show in english what the phrase is along with the pictures.
rosettastone,4,0,i turned off the microphone and now it doesn't enable it anymore.
rosettastone,4,0,fun and interactive sometimes it has a hard time registering but that might just be my phone
rosettastone,4,0,i can't deny that i'm learning.
rosettastone,4,0,pretty good but i wish there was a one day subscription if you watch enough as
rosettastone,4,0,really learning how to pronounce words and bowels properly
rosettastone,4,0,"i say the words, and it says, i said it wrong, ink what that's all about."
rosettastone,4,0,but i'm learning and that's a big plus thanks
rosettastone,4,1,microphone sensitive issues made the last lesson a little difficult.
rosettastone,4,0,mid can be difficult to pick but still good
rosettastone,4,0,a high end pp in the market love the learning style though a bit frustration sometimes
rosettastone,4,0,i just wish it had a few more free lessons
rosettastone,4,2,i'm having fun learning the language and feeling confident in my ability to speak thanks to the green light it gives me i will one day buy the program but right now i am seeing if i can get into the habit of using the program.
rosettastone,4,0,but i also dont completely understand what i might be saying in specific matters.
rosettastone,4,0,voice recognition seems to need a little work.
rosettastone,4,0,good pp sometimes laws behind and appears to get stuck occasionally but otherwise very useful
rosettastone,4,1,would be nice if it included lessons or explained grammar though
rosettastone,4,0,this is a very good pp i just wish the domo was longer
rosettastone,4,0,some lessons get extra redundant though.
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes the pronunciation gives me a green circle but marks it incorrect.
rosettastone,4,0,its done and kind fun but i really wish it could have nothing but argentina accent... but fun may to learn spanish...like i wish i could have an argentina setting a know
rosettastone,4,0,great experience with using a bluetooth device.
rosettastone,4,1,love the pp sometimes the voice recognition is difficult though
rosettastone,4,0,automatic system.. can't repeat during lesson.
rosettastone,4,1,sometimes the pp does not hear/record my responses.
rosettastone,4,0,great program just wish the full version was more unfordable
rosettastone,4,0,it's nice for pronunciation and grasping the accent.
rosettastone,4,0,excellent except the voice recognition is touch
rosettastone,4,4,speech recognition is a problem sometimes
rosettastone,4,0,it was ok but then their was a plan i wish they could make a free one that works
rosettastone,4,0,its great the the words need to be pronounced more clearly!
rosettastone,4,0,still learning all the uses.
rosettastone,4,0,"the method surprised me, but in giving it a chance i found that i have been learning quickly and not feeling overwhelmed."
rosettastone,4,0,"back in the dayton had online chats, that why i didn star you."
rosettastone,4,0,interested in how it will progress.
rosettastone,4,0,good in general.
rosettastone,4,0,would like to see the lesson progress when using the pp
rosettastone,4,3,"i don't mean grammar per se, i mean the way native speakers use the language, the irregularities, the quires."
rosettastone,4,3,that makes the connection with the language hard.
rosettastone,4,0,it tells me with pictures and act- but what am i saying exactly?
rosettastone,4,0,doesn't really give the translation
rosettastone,4,0,this pp is good.but this course are not free.i wish the courses were free.
rosettastone,4,0,pretty using of for the first time little tricky but ok
rosettastone,4,0,after buying the pp do you have full access to all the other languages or do you have to buy them separately?
rosettastone,4,0,better than domingo in regards to localisation and pronunciation.
rosettastone,4,0,would be easier hearing english translation too know what trying to say
rosettastone,4,0,i would like the play button to be bigger but i am enjoying the pp
rosettastone,4,0,this would be a five star if you could get the advantage free.
rosettastone,4,1,how can i set this so i'll be told the word in english then in my desired learning language??
rosettastone,4,3,"all is ok, but better to have all lessons free."
rosettastone,4,0,"it's too fast for a novice..please allow more time on pronunciation and grammar other than that, it's rrrr-eat!"
rosettastone,4,0,even in the free version i'm learning german really well!
rosettastone,4,0,not much explanation on where its taking you though
rosettastone,4,0,right now a four just started simple but still a little slow when learning spanish
rosettastone,4,1,it's wonderful but it's very expensive.
rosettastone,4,0,the system is nice but if you want the full enchilada your going to have to dig in your wallet.
rosettastone,4,0,"lovely, but... that price is steep."
rosettastone,4,0,pretty good way of teaching but wish the whole thing was free
rosettastone,4,0,lost progress on phone.
rosettastone,4,0,i dont like the premium but other than that its good
rosettastone,4,0,just completed the core lesson.
rosettastone,4,0,i am just using the free version.
rosettastone,4,6,i wish i could clock the full version but it is too expensive.
rosettastone,4,6,the only problem with the program is it doesn tell you what your saying.
rosettastone,4,6,in just saying words without knowing what they mean.
rosettastone,4,6,it doesn tell you how the sentence structure relates to your native tongue.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish it was free... ð
rosettastone,4,0,"just started, and in already learning a lot"
rosettastone,4,0,i need to log in every lesson
rosettastone,4,0,"a little prices, but worth it if you're dedicated."
rosettastone,4,0,please add english translation first
rosettastone,4,0,i'm enjoying the pp with the reminders
rosettastone,4,0,fun is not the right word.
rosettastone,4,0,doesn't have all the features/lessons web does
rosettastone,4,0,well it was a good pp but when i started it didn tell me what the actual words were
rosettastone,4,0,"it is a little difficult, but good"
rosettastone,4,0,i think this pp should add the meanings of the words before letting us say them
rosettastone,4,0,kind gives you the answer
rosettastone,4,0,doesn't teach what i am exactly saying or grammar santa etc.
rosettastone,4,0,i have nothing else to say.
rosettastone,4,1,expensive but good
rosettastone,4,0,i just wish they explain why words are the way they are
rosettastone,5,3,every time i try and load the page i get booted straight to the results page where i am told that i didn't achieve the pass mark.
rosettastone,5,3,if by some chance i manage to get to open the limestone section i get booted to the end results page and again am told that i didn't pass without being given the opportunity to complete the section.
rosettastone,5,24,i tried domingo and i had hearts i had to use and you run out very quickly.
rosettastone,5,1,it's actually very good i can say the repetition helped the most.
rosettastone,5,1,associating along with the images helps practically compared to strictly text and verbal lessons.
rosettastone,5,4,"not too much information at once, but i'm not getting bored at the same time.. as a teacher, i understand the value of giving less information to get more return in the students' education in learning something new and difficult."
rosettastone,5,12,i just started using the pp on my phone.
rosettastone,5,12,some of the text gets too tiny on my phone and once in a while the images are too small to make out relevant details.
rosettastone,5,12,i wish i could room in on text and images.
rosettastone,5,12,"the problem doesn't come up on every text screen, just when one or more of the text answers contains several words."
rosettastone,5,103,i like how you are able to picked where you left off with things like that everything has been presented as very manageable bite size lessons.
rosettastone,5,13,"only one concern with the latest version: when i go through a unit to tap the review lesson from core lesson 1 in easy access mode, it brings me to the review lesson for core lesson 2. this is a bug that was never fixed in later versions."
rosettastone,5,16,"before the trial finished, i tried to subscribe in my subscriptions on goose play, and it's not even there!"
rosettastone,5,16,so tomorrow they will charge me Â£50.99.
rosettastone,5,16,"went onto their site and chatted to someone via the chat pp, and they did not really know what they were talking about."
rosettastone,5,2,i would have given 4 stars because the pp kept forgetting what plan i was on.
rosettastone,5,0,immersion learning and the ability to choose your level and a learning plan get you right to the material that you need.
rosettastone,5,5,it helps slow things down bit.
rosettastone,5,4,they straight up charged me 100$ for the year instead of the monthly rate every year.
rosettastone,5,0,at first i thought the lessons were redundant.
rosettastone,5,0,halfway through the first unit i realized the set and structure has helped me retain the information and progress.
rosettastone,5,1,"i'm enjoying my first lesson, hearing the way things sound, seeing pictures corresponding to the actions as well as feminine and masculine versions of the words, then sounding them out works for me."
rosettastone,5,1,i like how it rates verbal pronunciation so i can gauge what i need to work on
rosettastone,5,1,within the first 30 minutes i was able to correctly identify the picture prompt using the correct corresponding polish phrases.
rosettastone,5,1,it has to use data in order to work.
rosettastone,5,1,but other than that it is an amazing pp it reaches you step-by-step and slowly allows you to adjust and learn the language properly from the beginning.
rosettastone,5,1,it's a good refreshed and can be done anywhere in small segments.
rosettastone,5,1,wish that the pp title lessons better.
rosettastone,5,1,the chapters are title but inside each chapter just says core lesson 1 2 etc... personally who like lesson labels
rosettastone,5,1,i love how you focus on the accent first before learning any words.
rosettastone,5,1,in my opinion it makes the experience a lot easier.
rosettastone,5,0,"it's great for learning any languages, the only thing is that it sometimes doesn't hear you, but that might just be my phone."
rosettastone,5,2,"the first lesson is enough to give you a feel for how the language works, and shows their unique method to making you uncover the answers on your own, instead of just telling you and having you memories it."
rosettastone,5,0,"the pp is very repetition, which is necessary for full immersion."
rosettastone,5,0,tres bien.
rosettastone,5,0,each 100% makes me feel like i've accomplished one small goal in my day.
rosettastone,5,0,"you hear, say, and see what you're learning, as well as writing."
rosettastone,5,0,repeat as manytimes as you can to get comfortable with the basis.
rosettastone,5,0,can move a little fast at times but still only on the free material and already planning on getting the full lessons.
rosettastone,5,0,vocabulary and pronunciation lessons in the first 30 minutes.
rosettastone,5,0,can't wait to purchase the life time membership.
rosettastone,5,0,quite genius if you ask me!
rosettastone,5,0,it's really good but what makes me confused is the pictures sometimes confusing and very small.
rosettastone,5,0,"on my of my phone it starts no problem, on another straight after entering password and email, it says ""something went wrong""."
rosettastone,5,0,very user friendly and immersion learning experience and great customer service.
rosettastone,5,1,i am only beginning lesson 2 but i can see how the system is trying to teach with a slow build up
rosettastone,5,0,"i enjoyed it a lot, it just sometimes misunderstood my speaking when it asked me to pronounce wordsðð"
rosettastone,5,1,wish i could test up.
rosettastone,5,0,ex.
rosettastone,5,0,les filled convent ~ the women are drinking!
rosettastone,5,0,in learning italian and i know most of the words!
rosettastone,5,1,very interactive pp and it has been helpful for me in learning french.
rosettastone,5,0,"obviously works better the smarter you are ð, but otherwise it's the best you can get."
rosettastone,5,0,"it improves me too learn other languages like french, because i will use it when i'm studying in canada."
rosettastone,5,0,can practice anywhere.
rosettastone,5,0,just need to be more accurate when you play voice so you don't get nothing wrong
rosettastone,5,2,i speak broken tagalog with the wrong verb conjunction.
rosettastone,5,0,good option to exclude audit and be able to use anywhere from my phone.
rosettastone,5,0,"the interface was a little confusing to work with, but once i learned, i was learning everything else."
rosettastone,5,0,i wish i have more free content.
rosettastone,5,0,just wish it had the daily reminder feature again!
rosettastone,5,0,like how it helps with pronunciation but wish there be more then just a picture to help you know what it is your actually saying
rosettastone,5,0,though pictures hard to tell boy from girl something
rosettastone,5,0,i love the idea the you can practice your pronunciation.
rosettastone,5,13,"when i hear the words now, i sometimes visualized the writing instead of the image, which i find frustration."
rosettastone,5,82,"like listen to music in the language you want to learn, podcasts, couture lids, also domingo."
rosettastone,5,82,i'm not really how my experience would have been other wise.ð
rosettastone,5,31,"also, it'd be wonderful if such exercises were to accept any response offered using correct grammar and vocabulary, not just canned responses."
rosettastone,5,0,you get what you pay for.
rosettastone,5,7,"i imagine once i have a good rounding in the language i will need to supplement with other sources to increase my depth and pace of learning, but for now this meets my needs."
rosettastone,5,7,i have a small baby and am finding the ability to use the product across multiple platforms and continue my learning in small chinks very useful - i am able to do a small amount every day.
rosettastone,5,0,a little time everyday can guide you to master a language.
rosettastone,5,0,but like all things you must commit to it every day.
rosettastone,5,8,"i love how it shows pictures showing you what each word means, how it says the word then wants you to match it to the right picture, how it gets you to pronounce the word & lets you know if your pronunciation is correct."
rosettastone,5,3,"the pp tells you what words mean using pictures, and challenges you to break down the sentences yourself."
rosettastone,5,3,"at first it seemed way too challenging, but i was surprised when they asked me to describe a picture for the first time and i said a full sentence of japanese on my own!"
rosettastone,5,20,i wish lifetime subscription was a bit cheaper.
rosettastone,5,20,"the only question is ""if i get lifetime subscription will it work for all languages or for just one i am learning?"
rosettastone,5,4,"the pictures provided give you a clear meaning of what some phrases, words, or sentences could mean."
rosettastone,5,0,i haven't even played for anything yet.
rosettastone,5,0,can't imagine the curriculum packages when i do.
rosettastone,5,0,perhaps it could have a cheaper option for the poorer like me ll
rosettastone,5,0,just getting started but hope i can speak a few new languages by the time i'm done.
rosettastone,5,0,it's a fantastic application but they have to tell us the meaning of the application and at the same time the application have to tell us what is the word mean in the sentence in what we're saying because we're saying it we does we don't exactly know what the picture is describing it's putting a man with a couple inside it's like a miniature can a cup or many people are drinking a cup i don't actually really understand it very well so like any time details to choose to language example first
rosettastone,5,27,"it doesn't just tell you, right off the bat, ""here's a word, now here's what it means in the other language""."
rosettastone,5,27,"no, it instead shows the words and plays a recording of them, or just plays a recording etc.."
rosettastone,5,9,this will make my progress go faster.
rosettastone,5,0,i am enjoying the application i like the fact that they are using 3 senior auditory digital visual however it would be more helpful if they would go more in details with anti hiragana kazan otherwise great learning tool it helps with using your brain for a change
rosettastone,5,0,immersion learning helps you to start to think in the language rather that translate all the time.
rosettastone,5,48,enough repetition to really absorb the information but never in a boring way.
rosettastone,5,58,the first thing i noticed with rossetta stone when saying the words was how sensitive the response is when it hears my speech in order to get my pronunciation just right.
rosettastone,5,43,"i think it's like other language apes, but a bit better, we'll structures... and in the end, you get what you pay for."
rosettastone,5,43,"i like that it takes you straight into using expressions immediately, not just learning redundant vocabulary words."
rosettastone,5,0,makes learning even faster.
rosettastone,5,45,"with a variety of exercises getting you listening and reading with enough repetition to ensure that what you learn sticks (although you can always repeat each lesson), i think i will make better progress here than other software solutions i have tried."
rosettastone,5,1,the new subscription option are a nice addition.
rosettastone,5,0,the pictures really help with the meaning of the words.
rosettastone,5,1,"i love the pp but needs some support on the grammar part, yes i know about the monthly subscription for support on this, but still would be awesome if they included a basis guide or something like that, still 5/5 stars"
rosettastone,5,0,closest thing to a classroom as i can get.
rosettastone,5,46,some may not know the 4 or 5 tones at all
rosettastone,5,20,5 stars - definitely the more expensive option but you get what you pay for!
rosettastone,5,88,it is great that the basic courses are free and the pricking is appropriate if you wish to actually use the language in day to day interactions or travel.
rosettastone,5,0,"i love how it lets you pounce it back, however, in not sure how accurate it is, given the fact that i seem to pass quite easilyð"
rosettastone,5,2,"simple, realistic word phraseology used in everyday speech."
rosettastone,5,5,"a misunderstanding about an old i subscription i hadn't used in a while but guess what they helped me out no doubt, no fuss, no sadness or feeling unsatisfied or some feeling like their were racism hope!"
rosettastone,5,0,the more time you invest in it and work hard at it the results are worthwhile.
rosettastone,5,1,i love that i can pull up my account on more than one device and easily pick up where i left off!!!
rosettastone,5,0,can't wait to dive in deeper.
rosettastone,5,0,i like the voice recognition being interactive.
rosettastone,5,1,"this is a good pp it help you said it the right way, it take you step by step, and it show you picture to know what it means or what it said."
rosettastone,5,1,"a little slow for me, especially the pronunciation part."
rosettastone,5,1,"maybe there's a way to speed it up... and, no, i still can't till my r's!"
rosettastone,5,1,"it tests you on the same thing multiple times to make sure you can say it, hear it, and read it."
rosettastone,5,1,you feel the results already at the beginning.
rosettastone,5,0,"it's a great program but too expensive, when other similar sites are free."
rosettastone,5,1,the immersion approach without english really works for me.
rosettastone,5,0,it seems to go rather rapidly but hang in there.
rosettastone,5,0,things you don't understand today you will in a week.
rosettastone,5,0,you what would be a cool feature?
rosettastone,5,0,random pop-up questions in whatever language or trying to learn!
rosettastone,5,1,i suggest going on a schedule though because you have to pass each section before moving onto another one.
rosettastone,5,2,the pp is cool but i prefer the full pp version.
rosettastone,5,0,this pp gives straight in with the actual work needed to be done to learn a language.
rosettastone,5,2,"if i decide to buy bigger packs, does it charge me monthly, or for full subscription period?"
rosettastone,5,0,i struggled with domingo... it just didn't sink in without the visual references.
rosettastone,5,0,love the fact that the pp makes you pronounce the words.
rosettastone,5,0,i can believe that only in a matter of hours have i learned how to communicate in another language!
rosettastone,5,0,ll in so excited its a great pp they break down the word for you so you know how to pronounce the word correctly.
rosettastone,5,0,my favorite is when you have to speak the word and the pp analyze your voice and lets you know if your saying it right.
rosettastone,5,2,the ai behind speech recognition has helped me a lot.
rosettastone,5,2,i'm very impressed by the work behind the pp.
rosettastone,5,0,"couldn't expect better, , it covers the 4 essential language basis in an advancing."
rosettastone,5,0,i love how you learn words in phrases and then say them.
rosettastone,5,0,you can do different courses-i am doing language lover.
rosettastone,5,0,there are about 24 different languages that you can do
rosettastone,5,0,i wish the lessons were outlined just a bit more to understand the class overall but i see why it jumps right i to the course in the language chosen.
rosettastone,5,2,"pretty good, the pictures allow you to know what you're saying even though you don't see an english translation, that really helpsðªð¾"
rosettastone,5,1,you cannot beat immersion learning.
rosettastone,5,1,the application makes sure you are pronouncing the the words correctly.
rosettastone,5,0,love how you can go back until you get the question correctly.
rosettastone,5,0,"just spend the money, you can't find anything this good for free."
rosettastone,5,0,its like being in school all over again.
rosettastone,5,1,"occasionally frustration as you learn the way a native speaker learnt and only repetition makes for advances, but it seems to work when you do it regularly."
rosettastone,5,4,i like that it tells me when i pronounce things wrong.
rosettastone,5,0,"please, fix the click button on top screen."
rosettastone,5,0,i need press many times for accept.
rosettastone,5,0,"very good, even that i speak english with a greek accent i still manage the program."
rosettastone,5,0,some difficulty with pronunciation.
rosettastone,5,0,expensive.
rosettastone,5,0,"this is actually better than domingo in my opinion, it does pronunciation, vocabulary, etc."
rosettastone,5,0,"the pronunciation of how to speak the language is very helpful, especially when it breaks up the words to say them correctly"
rosettastone,5,0,"pronunciation, illustration and spelling occurring at the same time."
rosettastone,5,0,i like the fact that in each lesson you can choose which areas you need to work on and repeat them as needed whenever you like.
rosettastone,5,0,the pp takes you over your problem parts when trying for 100% until you get it rightðð¾
rosettastone,5,0,they should be using this in all schools.
rosettastone,5,0,in my free trial its very very good.
rosettastone,5,0,i just dont know if i will experience the same when i already clock other lessons.
rosettastone,5,0,the pp has also worked perfectly for me.
rosettastone,5,0,i felt like it just threw me in there with no direction but suddenly i realized i was learning and it is sticking.
rosettastone,5,0,the parts that need to be in english are in english.
rosettastone,5,0,"i like using the pictures and speaking, rather then tying out the english translations!"
rosettastone,5,0,fully immersion but as a beginner it still makes sense.
rosettastone,5,0,"i feeling comfortable, cut they explain everything and you can practice the pronunciation"
rosettastone,5,0,quickly get immersed in learning
rosettastone,5,0,works i didn't know how to say any japanese when i started but after a couple of lessons i can speak and understand simple sentences
rosettastone,5,0,"no english translation, instead its all pictures and the spanish words."
rosettastone,5,0,if you adhere to the schedule you will go a long way in the language of your choice.
rosettastone,5,0,i'm learning organ as my mother in law is coming to visit and does not speak english.
rosettastone,5,0,customer support is great.
rosettastone,5,0,my only complaint is that on some languages i don't know what specific suspect i'm learning
rosettastone,5,0,i tried domingo and noticed that the way it reaches you let's you learn the language somewhat but the way it reaches you is to where you would never use the speeches it reaches you.
rosettastone,5,0,"live how it doesn't translate each word into english but rather shows a pictures and makes you think what the word could mean, so far i've learned plenty and the only language spoken has been the language i'm trying to learn."
rosettastone,5,0,can't wait to see how much i learn in a few months =)
rosettastone,5,0,i really like the voice interaction.
rosettastone,5,0,i love that you can listen to the language but it also grades how you pronounce the language as well.
rosettastone,5,1,but very satisfying
rosettastone,5,0,it was amazing in donna recommend it to my friends if they want to learn a new language and this helps look at the scenes and places and the words to match it and u say the words or self
rosettastone,5,0,cut basis in just around 20 mind.
rosettastone,5,0,very good pp but expensive
rosettastone,5,3,very good speech recognition
rosettastone,5,0,looking forward to the daily lessons
rosettastone,5,0,"i normally do my work on the computer, but i am trying it out on the phone to see if i am distracted less."
rosettastone,5,0,if you put the time into it.. you will see results.
rosettastone,5,0,so many people in my area speak russian would be nice to communicate some times a little easier on me and them.
rosettastone,5,0,i know some basic words already but i don't think i would have been able to do the lessons if i was a complete beginner
rosettastone,5,0,helps me pronounce the words right.
rosettastone,5,0,"i wish this was cheaper, beautifully presented"
rosettastone,5,0,very good learning pp but wish it was free all through
rosettastone,5,0,"i am still in the beginning stages but no complaints for now, try it out ð"
rosettastone,5,0,very creative and immersion keep in enjoying it
rosettastone,5,0,but your membership prices are too expensive for a student.
rosettastone,5,0,i choose to go non stop
rosettastone,5,0,with the pp i can just take my lessons wherever i go.
rosettastone,5,0,i can read and write but need work on speaking and hearing.
rosettastone,5,0,i like the pronunciation help.
rosettastone,5,0,"when i first decided to learn spanish i thought it was going to be extremely difficult, i was wrong!"
rosettastone,5,0,i just started the program but i love the may you interact with the pp!
rosettastone,5,0,i thought i'd set the bar high by learning japanese.
rosettastone,5,0,i was going to give 4 stars but realized it's not the program...it's me.
rosettastone,5,0,i like that it's pass/fail with pronunciation because that's where i struggle the most.
rosettastone,5,0,i've ignored most of them (hata) but it does plant the seed and today i started lessons again.
rosettastone,5,0,i was able to say the words with ease because the audit pronunciation were very clear.
rosettastone,5,5,"there is good repetition in the japanese language program to help get the vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar firmly entrenched in your brain."
rosettastone,5,5,i wanted to reinforce what i already know with the japanese program.
rosettastone,5,5,"despite the massive amount of japanese i already knew, the repetition has helped me streaming my ability to communicate."
rosettastone,5,5,"while i have only learned a couple new words, i more efficiently/quickly communicate in the language now."
rosettastone,5,6,"in those 2-4 hours worth of learning, i've noticed a drastic difference in my learning speed, how well i am able to recognize certain characters & phrases, and it has improved my ability to draw conclusions."
rosettastone,5,0,can you guns give me probably some discount please?
rosettastone,5,0,"everyday there is a new lesson plan, it's been less than a week and i am already developing a familiarity with vietnamese."
rosettastone,5,0,"helps, but you need to practice."
rosettastone,5,5,it is challenging but when i can't complete a task there are option to open 'windows' with translations (for instance) for further guidance.
rosettastone,5,5,the facility to listen and repeat in french is extremely useful.
rosettastone,5,0,i bought 3 months subscription but in application i see blocked lessons.
rosettastone,5,2,"it's really convenient to do it on my phone, because i can log in anywhere and practice any time."
rosettastone,5,7,i can see this taking up my time on the bus or walking my dogs.
rosettastone,5,1,"i spent 3 years in south more and was sceptic about how well the stone would actually translate, as most programs only teach you the original, ""proper"" way."
rosettastone,5,0,"summer its expensive, but there's nothing better!"
rosettastone,5,0,i love in an area with really bad connection so i love that you can download the program.
rosettastone,5,3,in other words do a different category every day for example.
rosettastone,5,3,"also sometimes the microphone doesn't pick up my voice clearly( it says voice is too loud or it doesn't pick up at all) so i get marked incorrect, but sometimes it is my pronunciation ."
rosettastone,5,0,in looking forward to future lessons.
rosettastone,5,1,"the only real problems are that you must buy one of the computer language packs to use this pp, and that you are only given access to the first portion of the language learning guide, and have to pay more to access the rest on your mobile device."
rosettastone,5,1,you should give this a try!
rosettastone,5,0,"you are just waking up at the morning and realizing that somehow you're just ..know.. no idea how, but you're just know."
rosettastone,5,0,"if you're new (in other words - zero level) in some language (german was my choice) - that is very-very good point to start, would 100% recommend."
rosettastone,5,0,i only wish i knew more about adjusting learning focused sooner and that there is writing practices available through the web version.
rosettastone,5,4,"i like how it has grammar, listening, and pronouncing with accent!"
rosettastone,5,4,the only con i have is sometimes it doesn't hear me a lot.
rosettastone,5,4,i do get a little mad but my house is pretty loud so...
rosettastone,5,0,wish i could practice more often.
rosettastone,5,0,but i really like the program.
rosettastone,5,1,i would recommend learning to read and write in the language along side using this.
rosettastone,5,1,my on only complaint is that in the speaking exercises it always thinks there is background noise or i am too loud(but that just may be my phone).
rosettastone,5,1,"at first i was a bit frustrated as you only had three tries at pronunciation, but, it really helps you learn things faster and focus."
rosettastone,5,0,i wish it was more in depth than the online and d version.
rosettastone,5,0,you can use the brother version on your phone so you essentially miss out on writing exercises and a limestone that actually helps you learn the language better.
rosettastone,5,0,"right now the pp is all i can use, but because in paying the 3 month subscription i wish i could get the full experience that i paid for."
rosettastone,5,16,a well thought out and enjoyable immersion in both the brother and the pp.
rosettastone,5,16,i am no longer tied to the desk and i have access to the same content in the pp as i have in the full brother.
rosettastone,5,16,at first i was apprehensive but found the quality is super and i like the idea of accepting content on the go.
rosettastone,5,6,i would only suggest the grammar lessons in the beginning have some sort of explanation as to why something's wrong.
rosettastone,5,6,"aside from that, i'm only 7 weeks in, and i like it, will continue using it."
rosettastone,5,31,like for example add the tying lessons i didn't know there were available until i signed into the webster.
rosettastone,5,31,"also, the microphone keeps listening if there is noisy in the surroundings can be nice to be able to stop the microphone after we pronounce the word."
rosettastone,5,2,"they also have different games you can play as well on the site, and you can see your continued progress with the lessons."
rosettastone,5,1,immersing yourself fully in the language and learning it in the same way you learned your native language is something i'm surprised hasn't become more common.
rosettastone,5,0,this pp reaches basis without telling you exactly what to say and you pretending to memories.
rosettastone,5,0,it also doesn't waste as much time on hello goodby and starts including basic grammar very early on
rosettastone,5,1,i've been able to learn at a constant pace without feeling overwhelmed or that my lesson plan was moving forward faster than i was learning.
rosettastone,5,1,i guess i should have let myself get past the second lesson because it gets very difficult and immersion.
rosettastone,5,0,"only issue i see is when the microphone is disabled to practice pronunciation, i would still like to be able to stay on the screen before it automatically jumps to the next."
rosettastone,5,0,"even if i can't do that particular exercise right then, i shouldn't be hurried past."
rosettastone,5,5,"this is a very good learning experience, because, unlike you, it greet you with warm hello in the language you're working on."
rosettastone,5,5,"although i can say the it is a summer that you have to pay for full lesson, but the good thing is they give you a week free!"
rosettastone,5,18,"audit quality is very good, and the speech recognition is remarkably good."
rosettastone,5,18,when you purchase the online subscription you can use virtually any device.
rosettastone,5,18,"i use my phone, an older andros tablet, a mac and bunt line."
rosettastone,5,5,you start from zero knowledge literally like the baby learning to speak.
rosettastone,5,16,i recently completed lesson 1 unit 1 with 98% accuracy and the pp recommended i retro for 100%.
rosettastone,5,0,having am amazing time learning the basis.
rosettastone,5,5,i somewhat wish there was more extended learning stories or other activities but it is still a five star pp.
rosettastone,5,22,the lessons are challenging (in a good way!)
rosettastone,5,22,"i like that the pp sends modifications to remind you to practice, though i haven't needed one lately!"
rosettastone,5,22,i'm on a 5 day streak :)
rosettastone,5,0,just wish it had a pay monthly option.
rosettastone,5,2,i am enjoying the lessons.
rosettastone,5,2,(1) sometimes i do not know why one tense or form of a word is correct.
rosettastone,5,2,i get the answers right but dont always know why.
rosettastone,5,2,"i am studying a new language on my smart phone, tablet and lawton."
rosettastone,5,2,very often when i come to the pp it has me on the wrong lesson because it doesn son up.
rosettastone,5,1,the recording are a lot sharper and i can understand the pronunciation a lot more.
rosettastone,5,1,i practice on my phone all the time.
rosettastone,5,1,i think the microphone can understand my speaking a lot more than other apes.
rosettastone,5,18,"if you pay attention, you not only learn vocabulary, but you also learn sentence structure and verb conjugations, as well as kann & anti."
rosettastone,5,0,i love doing the lessons on my phone.
rosettastone,5,117,"the further you advance, the more you encounter phrases that could well be used in real life situations."
rosettastone,5,117,"sometimes the pp behaves weird, but this can be resolved by closing and launching it again."
rosettastone,5,1,"the only negative thing about it for me personally, is that you don't get very many lessons for free."
rosettastone,5,1,"another thing i am personally having problems with, is my microphone."
rosettastone,5,1,"sometimes it won't hear me, and i end up shipping it because i can't figure out why it won't work."
rosettastone,5,0,very hard but rewarding
rosettastone,5,165,it's immersion and intuition and i will most certainly be continuing with my subscription.
rosettastone,5,165,"i've found one they flaw - and that is you need total silence for verbal exercise, if there a sire in the distance or even if you have your to on low, it struggles to differentiate."
rosettastone,5,7,only a few days in and i feel comfortable talking about my surroundings out loud due to the pp getting you to speak right from the beginning.
rosettastone,5,4,but does not offer an english version for some obscure words that you may never find in the picture that is associated with the words.
rosettastone,5,27,"it doesn't rely on grammar and spelling memorisation like so many apes do which can make the process of learning boring and frustration, and makes you not actually acquire the language in the most intuition, immersion and natural way possible."
rosettastone,5,8,"language learning is best done thou immersion, and this is as close as you can get without being in the native country."
rosettastone,5,8,the price is worth it if you are putting in the time required to learn.
rosettastone,5,0,i can't wait until in older and i can go to japan but for now ill just stick to learning japanese.
rosettastone,5,0,"i always complain about language learning apes not doing it right, translating directly from english without taking into account that sometimes the language has words that can't be translated and that it can make things harder to understand, the way this pp reaches gives you a fresh start like you would a child, and it helps you with your pronunciation."
rosettastone,5,3,"if i could ask for anything, it would be that for a language with a different alphabet, there be a little more rep work allowed on sounding out words."
rosettastone,5,3,5 syllable words in greek are more than a little difficult when you're still trying to learn what sounds the letters make.
rosettastone,5,16,"what i found weird was the fact that it started with phrases directly and the writing is in greek, so if you have no idea regarding the greek alphabet, that's donna be tricky."
rosettastone,5,2,"i have found it helps me, and my poor memory, to write things down along with frantic sounds, as i go along."
rosettastone,5,0,it reaches you a lot and gives you the option to put the english translation if you want it.
rosettastone,5,5,"i have my and language proficient in french, but for certain words it kept x'ing me."
rosettastone,5,5,"after multiple failed attempts, changing the voice recognition (still x), pronunciation difficulty (still x), it was my speed (correct!"
rosettastone,5,5,"however, for not being a live human, this root does remarkable well and my confidence in the grammar's improving too!"
rosettastone,5,61,you can learn so many words in such a small amount of time.
rosettastone,5,2,"the word teaching, however, is a bit slow."
rosettastone,5,2,the pp can be more effective by teaching more words instead of having the user go through some of the exercises over too frequently.
rosettastone,5,2,"the pp wants you to repeat the syllables, the voice pronounced syllables as it is spoken but the pp shows the word break down."
rosettastone,5,2,"voice pronounced ë¨¸ ê±° ì, pp shows ë¨¹ ì´ ì. the other issue is that it didn't teach the alphabet or pronunciation rules."
rosettastone,5,1,core lessons go a little fast but smaller specific lessons let you practice things like pronunciation of the syllables.
rosettastone,5,1,i like that it tells you of you are pronouncing something wrong.
rosettastone,5,0,"the speaking part is sometimes a little buggy, but overall i'm happy with this pp!"
rosettastone,5,0,looks expensive but well worth the money.
rosettastone,5,1,"there is only pictures and japanese words, no english (other then in menu) which i get since some words can't be translated into english but i wasn't used to this learning style so it took a few tries to get used to it, now i'm learning at a steady pace"
rosettastone,5,3,i've not only gotten better at my target languages but i also have more confidence in speaking them.
rosettastone,5,0,it even helps you develop the proper accent and pronunciation of the language of choice.
rosettastone,5,0,"there are some i elements i am critical of in the pp, such as having the play button to hear the option with a smaller live area than the button it's within (leaving little room for failure)."
rosettastone,5,0,was not so hard a little issue with my pronunciation
rosettastone,5,1,it tests your pronunciation.
rosettastone,5,1,"the written word is not for beginners, though."
rosettastone,5,2,i like that you can pause the exercises now.
rosettastone,5,2,it wont make you client but it gives you a great start.
rosettastone,5,2,you can certainly carry a conversation by the time you finish.
rosettastone,5,0,good pp but expensive
rosettastone,5,13,loved the pp because it actually reaches you the basis and how to pronounce the words correctly.
rosettastone,5,0,just a combination of picture and words and there you have it.
rosettastone,5,0,spanish in my case.
rosettastone,5,0,it's awesome but need some feature..
rosettastone,5,0,"good , but only one lesson."
rosettastone,5,11,"the only thing i think they could improve is the ""microphone"" on the pp, sometimes it makes me repeat and marks the pronunciation wrong while on the webster marks it right"
rosettastone,5,1,your brain learns it as though you you were fully immersed in the country.
rosettastone,5,1,the fee is a small price to pay for the amount of content you get access to.
rosettastone,5,0,getting the lifetime membership is worth the price.
rosettastone,5,0,its fun to try to pronounce the words even if my southern accent makes it a little off.
rosettastone,5,0,"be prepared to sound a bit silly at first, maybe do it alone."
rosettastone,5,162,i studied german in the past and was able to use up to unit 9 in review.
rosettastone,5,162,"however, i would suggest a basic background in german if you have never studied before."
rosettastone,5,285,comes with an optional audit portion i play in the car to reinforce my lesson.
rosettastone,5,16,"and it's easier to immense myself in the language because it doesn't give you english translation, just photo."
rosettastone,5,5,i suggest buying the desktop d-from to avoid the yearly subscription.
rosettastone,5,0,it works intuitively and functions perfectly.
rosettastone,5,1,used many learning tools before but this is supposed to be the one that should do the trick.
rosettastone,5,1,have the two year subscription.
rosettastone,5,0,pretty awesome if you'd ask me.
rosettastone,5,0,right off the back i decided this was the right choice for me.
rosettastone,5,0,i can say them.
rosettastone,5,0,work sentences out if i don't know the words.
rosettastone,5,0,it will give me an image and i can say it in french.
rosettastone,5,2,the only thing i do recommend is when they ask you to say that word make sure your in a quite place because you will be marked wrong if they don't understand you.ð
rosettastone,5,11,"unfortunately the pp doesn't allow you to complete milestones like you can on the desktop version, and some of the pictures are difficult to see on my phone screen."
rosettastone,5,11,maybe if the borders between the pictures were smaller it would help
rosettastone,5,9,the learning process is not overwhelming with complexities yet very reasonable with advances in the target language.
rosettastone,5,1,i appreciate the different levels of language learning and the increase in difficulty as you continue.
rosettastone,5,0,i love the pp on my phone because during the to commercial in the evening i turn down the volume and practice my spanish.
rosettastone,5,0,"you can choose what lessons you do, so jump between basic and more advanced which is really important cos i already have some spanish and get really bored starting at the beginning again, but need reminders sometimes too"
rosettastone,5,2,"roseola stone's voice recognition could use improvement, but other than that the program seems pretty good."
rosettastone,5,0,helps with grammar and speech.
rosettastone,5,0,learning tools extremely helpful with speaking !
rosettastone,5,2,but the program is still too expensive.
rosettastone,5,4,the only issue i have had is background noise affects how well it years and rates your pronunciation.
rosettastone,5,4,"otherwise, it has been very helpful fir keeping up on my practice, and since with my computer account!"
rosettastone,5,3,my only complain is that in the scenario that the learner is requested to pick one out of three icons the icons are very small and sometimes i miss because i can't see their content
rosettastone,5,0,"simulates learning language the way you would in real world immersion, by showing you stuff and letting you figure it out instead of teaching grammar etc."
rosettastone,5,3,different voice tones.
rosettastone,5,3,male and female voices.
rosettastone,5,3,accent recognition is decent.
rosettastone,5,0,the audit is easy to hear and the pronunciation can be well heard.
rosettastone,5,0,"if you mess up on a section, you can easily go back and review and it has good prompt."
rosettastone,5,11,i'm very disappointed...but wish i could afford the 'whole pp'.
rosettastone,5,11,"i think i would do well, if i could afford the whole course, i would try other languages as well."
rosettastone,5,0,"i'm learning japanese and it helps me with grammar, letters, and pronunciation."
rosettastone,5,0,"they even have stories to read, all without being on the premium version!"
rosettastone,5,173,"the mid pick up my voice well and i like that the pages don't advance automatically, so i have time to go back and pronounce phrases again, even if i got it right."
rosettastone,5,1,i have not purchased the lessons.
rosettastone,5,1,suggest a really quiet place with a good microphone.
rosettastone,5,0,"i don't have much complaint, only advice."
rosettastone,5,0,jump in.
rosettastone,5,0,"if you think you aren't getting it at first, just keep going."
rosettastone,5,0,"you can repeat as much as you want on each lesson, so go back over things you dont feel 100% about"
rosettastone,5,1,i like the way it reaches you words and how to put words in a sentence to use in an actual conversation.
rosettastone,5,1,instead of translating directly to your own language it shows pictures explaining what the word or phrase means would you can figure it out yourself.
rosettastone,5,1,i wish you guns will add some tips about oral practice especially for a exam.
rosettastone,5,4,you learn useful phrases that you actually hear and say when you visit another country.
rosettastone,5,0,"one thing i would add is, how to read it first, because if you're a beginner like me, it will be difficult at first."
rosettastone,5,0,i just wish they had kept the ability to purchase the software for the pp straight out or reduce the monthly rates.
rosettastone,5,0,i feel they have prices themselves at a point where cheaper cold cat software will move in.
rosettastone,5,0,"in my honest opinion, there is no better choice!"
rosettastone,5,0,i love and then check with goose translate .
rosettastone,5,9,no english from day one - just the new language.
rosettastone,5,9,several things are very specific and in depth
rosettastone,5,3,speech recognize works fine on my bluetooth heads.
rosettastone,5,1,just wish it offered belaya.
rosettastone,5,0,"but if you give it some time, you will see the patterns in the words, and that will help you learn and remember better."
rosettastone,5,0,well worth the money in my opinion!
rosettastone,5,7,"amazing, it tells you how close you were and even walks you through it."
rosettastone,5,0,i wish they had this when i was in school!
rosettastone,5,3,"it does require a good internet connection, but being able to steadily keep learning while anywhere in the house with the babies has helped a lot!"
rosettastone,5,0,"i can't wait to see, hear, speak and learn more!"
rosettastone,5,0,and i was wondering if the games you have on the webster will be added to the apes at any point?
rosettastone,5,2,everything thing though like even the pronunciation.
rosettastone,5,0,i suggest you keep a dictionary handy and other grammar helps close by.
rosettastone,5,0,"great learning pp, only issue i have which is really annoying is when you finish a section and it says you didn."
rosettastone,5,0,it might take a little more to grasp the meaning of words but surely makes you learn faster in the long run.
rosettastone,5,0,"sometimes it doesn't hear me, but i am using it more than i anticipated."
rosettastone,5,0,in enjoying it.
rosettastone,5,0,the mouth movements and rolling r's are different than in used to.
rosettastone,5,2,learning the basis and then learning how to pronounce the words makes it easier to work it into sentences!
rosettastone,5,0,i have the d from version but never have a chance to use it.
rosettastone,5,0,"but with it on my phone, now i can learn about anywhere."
rosettastone,5,0,it immersed you in the language your choosing.
rosettastone,5,1,"make sure your phone doesn't have a rotation lock installed (or set it to stock auto for this pp), since the venus are in portrait and the lessons are in landscape."
rosettastone,5,0,"mostly works great, the keyboard on brother edition could use some way better singing and a little less strictness on writing lessons."
rosettastone,5,0,mid sometimes breaks as well but that okay.
rosettastone,5,0,love that it makes you associate the words with images and sounds rather than giving you the english.
rosettastone,5,4,love all the features.
rosettastone,5,0,umiinom and ma eating babe means the girls are drinking.
rosettastone,5,0,i like that there is only the language that you learn with the pictures in the lessons.
rosettastone,5,0,i also like the audit which reinforced the pronunciation of all sentences that i come across
rosettastone,5,0,*since i use it for japanese along with other places* it shows the text in hiraganna.
rosettastone,5,0,but moment tell me what a translation is.
rosettastone,5,0,in the beginning it should tell you.
rosettastone,5,0,enjoying all the photography and examples.
rosettastone,5,0,total immersion that works.
rosettastone,5,2,"good visual learning tools, l like the stories books, it would be an improvement to have an ai communicate back in conversation with different possible variations in that particular language."
rosettastone,5,1,"love the fact that the basis are free, so you can try before buying."
rosettastone,5,0,"i like that you can disabled the speaking, great in instances such as using the pp on the train."
rosettastone,5,1,but i'm sure you could try to learn with the pp as some activities are quite repetition.
rosettastone,5,2,"challenging, but rewarding."
rosettastone,5,1,sometimes the instructions are not clear but i think that is the learning style.
rosettastone,5,0,"simple to use, and reaches in a way that makes sense rather than comparing to english."
rosettastone,5,0,able to repeat if needed.
rosettastone,5,0,have some trouble with the speaking parts.
rosettastone,5,0,"sometimes it won't register what i say, sometimes it will pick up the background noise but not me speaking into the mid."
rosettastone,5,0,have to guess the vocabulary once in a while
rosettastone,5,2,i have learned more organ in two weeks than i had in three years.
rosettastone,5,1,"more streamlined and higher quality than the online content in person myspanishlab, and it has a mobile pp!"
rosettastone,5,1,"only a few lessons in, and i'm thinking my answers in spanish, instead of searching for english translations in my head."
rosettastone,5,0,i like the pace and the clarify of instructor' pronunciation.
rosettastone,5,0,speech recognition to establish correct pronunciation works well.
rosettastone,5,3,"you have to study hard, and do the drills multiple times but before you realize it your not only speaking but understanding a new language."
rosettastone,5,0,actually amazing and is not pay to win
rosettastone,5,0,it actually works.
rosettastone,5,0,"not in english, but i'm not paying to learn english!"
rosettastone,5,0,"i'm a visual learner so using the pictures really help me, and after only 30 minutes i knew some words in organ!ð"
rosettastone,5,2,it helps you practice the words in context and lured them while looking at the objects and situations.
rosettastone,5,0,"you are good at what you are doing, but if you added a option to type down the definition of that word in english or what ever language you speak (in general) and in that language you are ( also generally said) trying to learn and type down for noble, but other wise great job."
rosettastone,5,0,the only thing that would be better is if they added explanations along with the images in case you do not understand what you are saying based on the picture.
rosettastone,5,2,can access office.
rosettastone,5,0,"i'm still very early on, but it has already taught me quite a bit."
rosettastone,5,0,"the requirements for the pronunciation feel like i'm speaking quite mechanically, but you have to start somewhere."
rosettastone,5,6,give spent 1 hour with the product and in amazed how fast in picking things up.
rosettastone,5,0,i like having the images along with the vocabulary.
rosettastone,5,0,the only problem i have is sometimes it doesn't catch my voice but it might just be my mid or background noise.
rosettastone,5,3,i can even pick up on conversations in spanish and italian.
rosettastone,5,1,can be hard at the start but keep going it works.
rosettastone,5,0,no translation irritated me at first but after a while i get used to it and it actually help me learning faster.
rosettastone,5,0,it feels like i'm learning words without realizing it.
rosettastone,5,2,starts off very basic but in time i think it will get better.
rosettastone,5,0,it's a bit annoying when you have to lip your device after each lesson to go for the next one.
rosettastone,5,0,one thing though is the audit can be tricky other than that i love it
rosettastone,5,3,you will not be disappointed.
rosettastone,5,1,"the picture are small & confusing at times, flat chester running women in a plain t-shirt is what???"
rosettastone,5,1,the guy has longer hair & nicer calves.
rosettastone,5,1,uses only the language that you are learning so you think in that language rather than translating in your head.
rosettastone,5,0,i actually enjoyed the lesson and the vocabulary review at the end.
rosettastone,5,0,i wish on the speaking part.
rosettastone,5,0,it would tell you what it doesn't like about your denunciation.
rosettastone,5,0,most of my errors are when i cannot clearly see the photo.
rosettastone,5,0,i love that you get to test and challenge your pronunciation as you go.
rosettastone,5,0,i think i'll stick with goose translate...
rosettastone,5,0,my only complaint is i didn't have money for a full subscription past the trial.
rosettastone,5,1,it follows the same lessons as the web portal and has gotten me speaking italian quickly.
rosettastone,5,1,you have to put the time in though.
rosettastone,5,1,i'm sure i'll enjoy it when i make a payment where i'm a little confused where it says it's x $ amount a month and x $ amount a year in at the check out it shows x $ amount a year do you pay full price at once and have it for a year or actually pay x $ amount a month
rosettastone,5,0,i was able to repeat phrases in days after starting the course.
rosettastone,5,1,"very comprehensive, keeps me engaged."
rosettastone,5,0,especially when you're learning russian and don't really know the words in any form you're used to
rosettastone,5,0,don't know yet how it will work for grammar and sentence creation.
rosettastone,5,0,amazing experience i wish i could just pause the screens so you can look at the answers instead of it automatically going to the next one.
rosettastone,5,0,it's not difficult yet i am retaining the information very well!
rosettastone,5,0,audit is very clear.
rosettastone,5,0,clear and precise accents in the audit.
rosettastone,5,0,it makes you speak and pronounce the words/sentences so you can actually learn!
rosettastone,5,0,i wish this pp had the games available on the webster.
rosettastone,5,0,i do it side by side with other recommended books.
rosettastone,5,1,price was a bit more than i hoped but avoiding as and getting results should make it worth the cost.
rosettastone,5,0,"this is kind tough, in using goose to translate some key words for me."
rosettastone,5,0,but all in all great
rosettastone,5,2,"i have somehow started pronouncing rolled r's, even though i never could before."
rosettastone,5,0,"i can practice at a designate time, or fit it in if something comes up."
rosettastone,5,0,"wish the pp remembered better where i left off when signed in on new device, but it's okay"
rosettastone,5,0,i never expected i could start learning a new language in the language i am learning!
rosettastone,5,23,it can feel weird at first but it will click.
rosettastone,5,3,its worth the price no matter how dedicated and depth you seek to learn!
rosettastone,5,0,"you think you don't understand a word, but in a couple of minutes, you're using it in sentences as if you've always known it."
rosettastone,5,1,i never thought i could learn french especially in a short time but i can now.
rosettastone,5,0,"i like the pp for my smart phone, but maybe 3 pictures across instead of a 4 block would be easier to view."
rosettastone,5,0,also i would like to work on learning how to say and spell the words more.
rosettastone,5,0,i think that the pp works perfectly.
rosettastone,5,0,"the pronunciation is a little hard, but the rest of the pp is fun."
rosettastone,5,0,sadly i do wish it want the price it is but i think its still worth it
rosettastone,5,0,here you can see that they have language learning methodology behind it.
rosettastone,5,0,complete the all the courses and you should be client!
rosettastone,5,0,i work on my own pace and i can always go back and red a lesson.
rosettastone,5,0,i received a 96% on my first lesson.
rosettastone,5,0,not bad at all.
rosettastone,5,0,probably the best free one out there (you can buy the full version but even just the free works exceptionally well)
rosettastone,5,0,my favorite part is saying the words in the new language!
rosettastone,5,0,i learned more in the beginner lessons than i had imagined i would.
rosettastone,5,0,audit doesn't always work even though i switch devices.
rosettastone,5,0,for getting the audit to repeat are hard to click on.
rosettastone,5,0,i found this hard at first but once i'd come to grip with it i really enjoyed it and found it very good.
rosettastone,5,0,i've completed the basic lessons but have to pay to advance :((
rosettastone,5,0,the only thing missing is the written aspect.
rosettastone,5,0,"very in-depth, its got pictures with the word you are saying so you can understand what you are saying."
rosettastone,5,0,it cleverly immersed you in the language while customizing to your weaknesses and strength.
rosettastone,5,0,the lessons are short but you still learn quickly.
rosettastone,5,1,"very enjoyable, love the pictures with the audit, makes learning a little quicker."
rosettastone,5,0,they ask if the content is in english... really?
rosettastone,5,0,"no, it's in spanish but that's the point... ll"
rosettastone,5,0,great value for money if you get the unlimited version!
rosettastone,5,0,you can try the free trail and go from there.
rosettastone,5,0,the free domo got me hooked.
rosettastone,5,0,the best part for me is the pronunciation portion that i will be practicing regularly!
rosettastone,5,0,this program with goose translate and goose keep give one the tools to progress.
rosettastone,5,0,constantly progressing but lots of opportunities to review what has already been learned
rosettastone,5,0,love it from the very first screen!
rosettastone,5,0,this pp focused on pronunciation a lot which can be frustration when you're first starting out.
rosettastone,5,0,i usually try and fit in a lesson on my lunch break!
rosettastone,5,0,i have struggled with organ forever but just a few hours with this pp and i have finally started understanding
rosettastone,5,0,no translation is better learning
rosettastone,5,0,sadly it isn't all free and you need a fairly expensive subscription to use it all.
rosettastone,5,0,great pp you need to either know the words though or look them up.
rosettastone,5,0,"if you don't keep up with it, you will forget so keep at it."
rosettastone,5,0,it's like i'm playing a game but learning at the same time.
rosettastone,5,0,but i don't see my language on there.
rosettastone,5,0,the breakdown of each section helps with retaining information.
rosettastone,5,0,quality and smart program!
rosettastone,5,0,"not cheap, but you know you're buying quality."
rosettastone,5,0,unfortunately to expensive for people in more poor countries who works in the tourism.
rosettastone,5,0,"it's very well created, the application i mean, but i think few more free lessons would entice one to buy into any given subscription plan."
rosettastone,5,0,i have a version on the computer.
rosettastone,5,3,i'm learning makarin and practicing a couple hours every day.
rosettastone,5,3,you can even download content if you don't have access to wife.
rosettastone,5,0,i have not encountered problems yet.
rosettastone,5,0,"when i'm learning, i'm not thinking in english."
rosettastone,5,0,"give only just started, but the language choice are good, the lessons are depth, and the lessons go at your case."
rosettastone,5,0,the pp really relief on getting in tone with your skill.. it puts pressure on pronouncing which makes it worth your while
rosettastone,5,0,pronunciation in audit is very helpful.
rosettastone,5,0,"i have finally been able to put in context ""s"" and ""us"" (in learning spanish) for the first time confidently"
rosettastone,5,0,"i hate that i have to pay to be more advanced in it, i wish it were free"
rosettastone,5,0,learning to pronunciate properly!
rosettastone,5,0,it really helps when you can rely on the alphabet you are already used to.
rosettastone,5,1,awesome in learning cantonese now .
rosettastone,5,2,"the pp runs very well, with no problems."
rosettastone,5,8,"the pp doesn't let me play any lessons, despite having an active subscription, i click on any lesson and it says error ""please try again later"" and never works"
rosettastone,5,0,i think you need to have the english translation so i know exactly what i'm saying and not just repeating what i'm hear or seeing.
rosettastone,5,0,not bad with phone microphone but better with added microphone.
rosettastone,5,0,learning is fast and ensures correct pronunciation!
rosettastone,5,0,"i'm in the very beginning, but learnt a lot of words already."
rosettastone,5,0,"it really helps with the speaking, but i'd like to write too."
rosettastone,5,1,gets you to understand without translating e very word in your head.
rosettastone,5,0,the fact that they also test your pronunciation is amazing.
rosettastone,5,0,requires heads else mid is having a hard time.
rosettastone,5,1,i don't have the money to pay for the full lessons so i can only review the free lessons.
rosettastone,5,0,you have to figure out they are teaching you the words without actually saying come means eating.
rosettastone,5,0,"uses different tactics to get you to the point of memorization and repetition, but you barely notice"
rosettastone,5,0,the pp makes learning very tres critique!
rosettastone,5,0,it also keeps it short so you can slip it in whenever!
rosettastone,5,0,i like speech recognition.
rosettastone,5,0,"it works well especially for pronunciation, which is an area i need improvement in."
rosettastone,5,2,i would recommend to put on modifications to stay motivate so you can see a change
rosettastone,5,0,"learning quickly and understanding quickly, but pronouncing words correctly and frustration is the hardest part"
rosettastone,5,2,you learn the basis pretty quickly and through reinforcement the language sticks.
rosettastone,5,0,it's great to have pronunciation along with listening to the spoken word.
rosettastone,5,0,without the english translation it allows your brain to see the picture and associate the spanish word easier
rosettastone,5,0,loving the immersion approach and the emphasis on pronunciation.
rosettastone,5,7,"actually i said the content is in english, but the whole thing is actually whatever language you pick."
rosettastone,5,0,i also like that you can go back and practice some more
rosettastone,5,0,"i just started using this software via my andros phone, and i must say that i wish i had known about it much earlier."
rosettastone,5,0,"a little weird at first, but great tool."
rosettastone,5,0,especially loved the pick with the spelling and the voice over at the same time
rosettastone,5,0,you can work short lessons throughout the day easily!
rosettastone,5,0,it gives you quires and tests.
rosettastone,5,1,"practically completed whole book in under on year, a little language barrier w the teach support."
rosettastone,5,1,bought the trial first but will definitely pay for the full version
rosettastone,5,2,ships the translation and forces you to think in anew language
rosettastone,5,0,just in a few lessons i have already seen improvement!
rosettastone,5,0,it also helps that they only teach you in the language that you're learning so that you learn not to rely on your mother tongue when learning the new language.
rosettastone,5,0,"eventually as you progress to learn dialect, arab speaking people assist with teaching dialect which either shorten words or combined them into sayings making the language easier."
rosettastone,5,0,i was skeptically but it works.
rosettastone,5,0,"very good, wish there was month payment option but i could not find one."
rosettastone,5,0,"i can communicate with customers calling our business in listening, speaking, and writing messages because is had me practicing all of those things plus reading!"
rosettastone,5,1,"i mean, such detail when it comes to teaching pronunciation of arabic!"
rosettastone,5,0,"very helpful with audit, pictures and repeating the phrases"
rosettastone,5,0,would like more free lessons.
rosettastone,5,0,i'll be speaking organ in no time at all!
rosettastone,5,0,might be difficult because language uses cyrillic alphabet.
rosettastone,5,0,but the free trial reaches you quite a bit as well.
rosettastone,5,0,it's really helpful the option for writing reading and pronunciation.
rosettastone,5,0,all the lessons link to each other.
rosettastone,5,4,"i am only having problems with not finding my italian box which had all lessons, and it not ne active anymore."
rosettastone,5,4,sadly lost box....
rosettastone,5,0,just starting but compared to other apes the voices are clear and breakdown is on point
rosettastone,5,1,challenging but rewarding.
rosettastone,5,0,the voice catching is tough to the pp but overall is fantastic
rosettastone,5,0,i can't say enough good things about this program.
rosettastone,5,0,really good pp for learning but sometimes can be a bit slow
rosettastone,5,0,really simple phone i. just wish the picture choice were slightly bigger for my sausage fingers.
rosettastone,5,0,it's kind hard because if you can pronounce words right it can cost you but it's worth getting.
rosettastone,5,0,i got the paid version.
rosettastone,5,0,do not waste money in language courses.
rosettastone,5,0,all problems are because i put the wrong email.
rosettastone,5,0,i'm amazed by the design and content.
rosettastone,5,1,but this way i am learning a retaining the information.
rosettastone,5,0,"nice methodology, could use some ai to cut a bit the repetition"
rosettastone,5,0,i will be paying for this next week in full.
rosettastone,5,0,nice but its not free
rosettastone,5,0,after one lesson i am talking and testing in full sentences.
rosettastone,5,0,very useful and needed since i now live in germany but don't speak german
rosettastone,5,0,"awesome, mid seems a little sensitive but awesome!"
rosettastone,5,1,it is a very good way to learn new words but won't tell you the whole language though .
rosettastone,5,2,tried them all.
rosettastone,5,2,believe me if you dive into it your brain does the rest.
rosettastone,5,0,"learned quite a bit on the first lesson, i just wish i could get a translation so i know exactly what i'm saying."
rosettastone,5,0,a little generous on the speech engine but that okay :)
rosettastone,5,0,works great even though i was charged three times refused once but only one account
rosettastone,5,1,definitely worth the upgrade from the desktop version
rosettastone,5,0,great joined ti learn and get a amazon card and they wont give it to me now and i push all the buttons and everything.
rosettastone,5,0,thought to spend little time in surveying then more time in the gift cards that i won but hope i quit!!
rosettastone,5,0,the words stick more to me with how the illustrations and them go together.
rosettastone,5,0,and boy do i enjoy not being told in english what i'm learning.
rosettastone,5,0,i have only one concern about the cost.
rosettastone,5,0,but voice recognize will should be improve.
rosettastone,5,0,"hearing, seeing and pronouncing the way you would in the country."
rosettastone,5,0,"a bit buggy, but great content and activities"
rosettastone,5,0,i think i've learned more in one week then i have in a smelter in college.
rosettastone,5,0,the immersion method works for me.
rosettastone,5,0,"the pictures r a little small but it's fine, i guess."
rosettastone,5,0,"great pp, especially the voice recognition"
rosettastone,5,0,the teachers voice is nice too
rosettastone,5,0,"expensive, but the most effective program out there."
rosettastone,5,0,"love it,wish i could subscribe and change languages every one in a while ð¤"
rosettastone,5,0,i love it and am receiving new learning tactics that engage me in the learning.
rosettastone,5,0,more verbal than the others so you really get to practice.
rosettastone,5,0,i like that you get to speak see if the answers
rosettastone,5,0,i learned most japanese words and phases
rosettastone,5,0,i love the speech recognition!
rosettastone,5,0,he's me pronounce the the words correctly i give this pp at 5 star
rosettastone,5,0,you get what you pay for.
rosettastone,5,0,pretty good but no translation might be an issue
rosettastone,5,0,unfortunately further sections are not freeð
rosettastone,5,32,i think i made more progress in the first few minutes with this pp than the several hours i spent with the other pp.
rosettastone,5,0,works well on a large screen cell phone.
rosettastone,5,0,on a small screen phone you will go blind.
rosettastone,5,0,it has an amazing voice recognition software
rosettastone,5,0,passed the first course and have already learned more than i did in japanese class year one.
rosettastone,5,0,follows the computer program pretty close and hears my voice well too
rosettastone,5,0,great pp on every bit but can you please add more languages
rosettastone,5,0,microphone is bad but really helps you learn
rosettastone,5,0,i love this will have to buy the whole thing
rosettastone,5,7,so far i'm happy wish the brush up i'm getting before i visit my son and daughter-in-law in the netherlands next summer.
rosettastone,5,7,looking forward being able to speak more dutch by the time i get there.
rosettastone,5,1,it helps you with reading and speaking!
rosettastone,5,1,i can't wait to be client in spanish!
rosettastone,5,0,just wish it was more unfordable.
rosettastone,5,4,i just download this pp and finished the core first lesson.
rosettastone,5,0,just having a hard trying to add on a second language.. i have my first one and went and purchased a second language for when i am done with the first.. please help anyone!
rosettastone,5,0,i don't even notice i'm learning.
rosettastone,5,0,maybe something that told you what you were learning.
rosettastone,5,0,i.e the difference between has and doesn have in organ gives no indication to that being what you are learning.
rosettastone,5,0,i found this pp both information and helpful when it came to furthering my spanish comprehension and grammar dont change a thing
rosettastone,5,0,"it sometimes crash, and difficult to login."
rosettastone,5,0,i love the fact that i can take the course with me on the go anywhere.
rosettastone,5,0,"in progress, and very easy learning."
rosettastone,5,1,a little faster than the actual disks same content
rosettastone,5,0,nice photo.
rosettastone,5,0,i had this d from at one point in my younger age but lost it.in so glad i found the pp now i can learn anywhere.
rosettastone,5,0,"after completing the lesson, there are activities to practice the lesson again and again, one of them is pronunciation which is important because most of us get that wrong."
rosettastone,5,0,i can wait to finish the core programs to be able to play the games.
rosettastone,5,1,"i was a bit ensure at first, but, as the lesson progressed, i found my confidence and knowledge improving."
rosettastone,5,1,the real test will be when i go on holiday next week
rosettastone,5,0,i wish the purchase price is reduced though .
rosettastone,5,1,not just conjugating words on paper the lessons have you involved by actual speaking in all the tense.
rosettastone,5,0,i just started with my lessons and i am really enjoying the pace and how i am learning.
rosettastone,5,0,i wish it was a little less expensive though.
rosettastone,5,1,exciting feeling like in learning.
rosettastone,5,0,due!
rosettastone,5,0,picture learning
rosettastone,5,0,"ink about alone, but this in combination with lots of other things in doing is keeping me learning quick"
rosettastone,5,19,it's actually better for time management to fit learning in when i'm waiting for my wife to be done shopping while i'm in the car with my kiss sleeping.
rosettastone,5,19,"only issue i have is that my audit doesn pick up ""el..."" word when doing the speech portion, but otherwise very accurate and helpful via the appropriate repetition format"
rosettastone,5,0,color me impressed!
rosettastone,5,0,it should load faster...
rosettastone,5,1,speech recognition is key.
rosettastone,5,0,"i don't have much free time, so i can study in small chinks."
rosettastone,5,0,it's good it works i just started using it and think i got a few words down
rosettastone,5,0,"i was surprised, because at first it seemed like they where expecting too much, but then things just started falling in place."
rosettastone,5,5,i just had a question.
rosettastone,5,0,many different practice option available.
rosettastone,5,1,most expensive but worth it
rosettastone,5,0,finally upgrade my phone and can now study any where.
rosettastone,5,0,love game red helps me know other languages in the worlds
rosettastone,5,0,"in enjoying the interactive exercises, i'm still on the first core lesson."
rosettastone,5,0,i feel like in actually learning!
rosettastone,5,0,i like the interaction.
rosettastone,5,1,"i never thought that i could learn italian, with this program i am speaking, reading and learning faster that i thought i would."
rosettastone,5,0,i can remember majority of the words & meaning with the pictures!!!!!
rosettastone,5,0,the fact it provided european spanish was the biggest plus point.
rosettastone,5,0,the pitch has been fixed and now works.
rosettastone,5,0,"i like the fact that you have different lessons such as grammar, listening, reading, etc and that there is a lot of repetition."
rosettastone,5,1,learning what i can but you have to repeat yourself a couple of times and they don't jump in with vocabulary first which makes it a little
rosettastone,5,0,every pp has helped me learn japanese only this one helps me retain it however
rosettastone,5,0,the traveler package allowed me to focus on the basis that i would need during vacation.
rosettastone,5,0,wish it was free for the year.
rosettastone,5,4,"only 2 lessons in, but i really like their method."
