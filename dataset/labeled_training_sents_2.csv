i got the app and have been using it all the time.,0
personally thought it was great.,0
this doesn't help learning.,0
so i will never use this app anymore.,0
come on!,0
now are 4 hearts!,0
"they have definitely gone back on that for a full, max profits model.",0
learning a new language is about making mistakes and learning from them.,0
i haven't progressed since this change.,0
this is clearly a new recent bug,0
i loved the app!,0
but the last update is really not pleasant!,0
i'm very upset about this.,0
it's very confusing.,0
mistakes are a big part of learning (even duo says so! ),0
!,0
"duolingo was an amazing app, would've given it 5 stars a couple months ago.",0
but the latest updates do not promote language learning like they used too.,0
it's like they took away everything that made this app work.,0
would even pay for those features in the future.,0
right now i want to abandon it.,0
"makes me feel stupid, sucks my determination to get this learnt.",0
can't see why it's supposed to help.,0
"if it's just to make you pay, then i get that.",0
great app!,0
really?,0
why?,0
no thanks .,0
.,0
.,0
the app has been mostly helpful but its frustrating to be stuck with nothing to do on it.,0
"i'm sure the ""improvement"" in user experience makes me want to buy premium.",0
developers need to address this problem anyone who's eye sight isn't perfect struggles.,0
i'm not going to pay for plus when i can't see it.,0
i'm very disappointed.,0
"i cant complete the exersize, if i cant hear what is being said.",0
"i have started over multiple times, because of this problem",0
its not worth the frustration.,0
im just glad i have another app to help with my studies,0
"', 'i don't have the cow but i have the leather' etc.).",0
didn't have to do that in the past you want too much information,0
i've always loved this app.,0
which means i cant move for ward in the lessons and it keeps failing me.,0
please i would need your assistance to fix this.,0
thanks,0
my mom got this app before it was updated and i got it after.,0
i dislike the update but otherwise this is a fairly good app.,0
"other than that i really, really, really like the application.",0
:),0
a bit disappointing,0
i guess i'll just have to uninstall the app,0
*&#$%!,0
@Â¥% is what i think about it.,0
please fix this.,0
2 stars because there are alot of errors and no delelopers have responded or fixed!,0
!,0
so many features are missing that it's laughable.,0
i had to do the rest on pc.,0
if i had to do it on pc then why is there an app?,0
i am using the app for japanese learning.,0
good idea but very poor implementation.,0
"nice concept, intuitive execution.",0
has potential.,0
cons: -lacks depth.,0
a one month course or podcast can teach you far more than the whole app.,0
"this means that out of the 30 minute session, perhaps just 5 minutes are actual content.",0
"after about 10 min,my son not interested in this app.",0
i purchased the cd version for my son.,0
when i saw there was an app for mobile devices i thought it would be a great addition.,0
you'll just be guessing at everything.,0
this is really annoying as i am doing and saying exactly what it wants.,0
this is why the app is more bad than goodðŸ˜’,0
"decent amount of languages available, but competitors offer a more vast pool and a better complement for language learning.",0
not a big fan.,0
literal objects are easy to learn by guessing.,0
concepts are not.,0
it's a momey grab and languages should be cheap and or free,0
now i can't do any speaking exercises at all now.,0
disappointed!,0
they are only available for ios.,0
"love this app, really great.",0
my accent and vocabulary are really improving!,0
why can't i create an account?,0
"the app says it has problems with its system and ask to try to later, but through some time the same happens again.",0
i have the desktop account which i'm able to login to.,0
"please, can ye help me.",0
thank you,0
seems like it would be a good way to learn i've heard many good things but i would like to learn sign language and it is not an option sadly.,0
confusing.,0
you have to guess what each one is,0
$17 a month?,0
no thanks.,0
although it's a really good app it makes you pay aft we're r so long but i should have expected that,0
the voice recognition is a ðŸ’© emoji.,0
i really love this app but the recent update is awful.,1
i lost a 161 day streak because of that!,1
get a few wrong questions wrong and you can't continue learning.,1
"this is intended for english people, many things are not precise in this app.",1
please make updates mandatory.,1
"about a month in i tried to get my girlfriend to join, but for whatever reason her game uses ""hearts"" where mine uses ""lingots"".",1
"this difference literally means that she cannot do what i have been doing, which is playing for about 5 minutes each day.",1
"the heart system actually stops you from learning and instead blocks you with a pay wall to play their ""free"" app...",1
"only geared towards an american audience, for both spanish and english learners (even the flags are wrong).",1
the same with portuguese.,1
it's very inconsistent when mis-typing due to finger errors.,1
"however, the biggest problem is there are never any explanations as to why the rule is as it is.",1
you only know if it's right or wrong and have no indication why this is the case.,1
very limited but a decent option to start learning some basic vocabulary for a new language.,1
this new heart thing doesn't work.,1
i got answers that are right but lose hearts regardless.,1
i get penalized for minor spelling errors.,1
and on top of that i need gems to refill those hearts.,1
how long does it take to refill those gems.,1
it might help you get more subscribers but whatever.,1
learning has turned from something fun to a stupid grind to refill my hearts.,1
doing japanese course in introductions and it is extremely frustrating when using boku/watashi no namae wa sakura honda desu.,1
when using 'desu' in the sentence it is purely at random of and can get me to lose a hearts.,1
it feels more like luck instead of learning.,1
please fix as this feels like an intentional feature to buy premium membership which goes against your moto if free learning.,1
it was a awesome app at the beginning but the sound has stopped since i started italian.,1
i tried every way to fix it but didn't answer.,1
you cut off the option for regenerate hearts!,1
"i know the offline option isn't free but please duolingo, you guys where doing it right.",1
the heart system ruined it.,1
"ever since they implemented the heart system, this app is pay to progress, despite it being heavily advertisement oriented to ""keep learning free"".",1
since the heart system you are only allowed five mistakes per lesson or you have to pay the in app currency to refill your hearts.,1
you now need to pay lingots to test out of a level.,1
that is really infuriating for people who want/can to progress fast.,1
update (30-dec-2019): it is now the second time that i open my duolingo on a monday morning to find that my streak freeze was used up even though i had a weekend amulet.,1
i can't take anymore a placement test when doing another course.,1
"then you can't delete a course, i mean that if you took one course for english speaker, you cannot delete it if it's the only one, even having a lot more for french speaker, so you're king of getting lost with courses for different language speaker, i wanted to try but i don't like and i can't remove it.",1
"also why did you stop to offer ""free test"" .... please do something",1
"tried to learn hindi.. and i noticed problems, such as different vowels sound exactly the same, theres no distinction at all, and hense it's just a guess which one to choose, most like leading to making mistake.",1
"also, i couldn't complete several tasks due to the app not accepting the correct answer.",1
"and the last, it doesn't have any grammar notes or explanation, so it's really like running in the fields with no direction",1
there's a problem with syncing information on the duolingo app on mobile devices and on the duolingo on the computer.,1
"i practiced on my computer, but it didn't reflect on my phone.",1
also why is there different lesson information on the duolingo on pcs?,1
"i used to love this app and progressed rapidly, but then they started using the heart health and penalizing me for mistakes on new lessons.",1
and i've been extremely frustrated with the hearts and having to quit a lesson towards the end because i ran out of hearts.,1
please go back to lingots and no hearts!!!!,1
"i tried to use the online version, which doesn't have the hearts, but it's hard to use on a mobile devise.",1
plz discontinue the hearts!,1
"ok so i've been using this app for years and it's always been helpful but the update is such a downgrade, i live in an area where phone signal and wifi are spotty so i used to download the lessons and do them offline, but now i apparently have to pay $12.99 monthly???",1
"also you can't see all the lessons in a group ( ex you used to click on ""basics"" and it would show you what you were gonna learn in every lesson) and the progress quizzes used to be free so you could skip things you already knew..",1
i used to actually retain information with this repetitive practices and high daily goals.,1
now goals mean nothing and lessons are short and not memorable.,1
the hearts system makes this otherwise great app unuseable.,1
"you can't repeat the lesson, even from the beginning.",1
"you have to wait hours, reach few hours you get one more heart, which is one more answer you can get wrong.",1
"not sure though, maybe they will have hearts after you pay too.",1
"as long as you dont mind that it can and will take pictures, look at your personal pictures, record audio, record video, modify your settings, modify your sd card, read data on your sd card, delete content on your sd card, search, find and view other accounts tied-in with your phone, analyze wifi connections, analyze data from anyone else who is on the same wifi as you, run at start up and listen through your microphone.",1
"to learn words its ok, as its an online app, there is no explanation as to when and why the word/meanings/phases change, just when you think you've got it, not so!",1
"unfortunately i used the plus free trial, and missed the cancellation date, so of course i was charged $167.00, beware as it auto renews in 12 months, together with being constantly bombarded with emails from them.",1
completely stuck on multiple hindi courses.,1
there are stages in the lessons which have a 'match the letter to the sound' portion and tÅ« and jhÅ« sounds each do not allow me to match them with the provided symbols.,1
so far my only option has been to spend gems to take the test to skip the lesson but if those sounds come up during the lesson then i've wasted gems and cannot continue.,1
this app is good but falls short in one aspect it will sometimes allow bad spellings of words when it may be one letter off but other times it will fail you for the same misspelling regardless of level.,1
they also hit you with phrases out of the blue where they have not even covered that phrase or even those words so you are forced to spend more time checking the translation then actually learning anything.,1
immersion is better than showing translation.,1
i did not find it enough helpful in learning japanese katagana and kanji!,1
japanese teaching method is also odd here.,1
one should probably find some other apps if they have to learn eastern languages....,1
"it relies on 3rd parties to clarify concepts, which aren't available for every exercise.",1
it is inconsistent in its accepting translations.,1
"it provides insufficient preliminary information pertinent to the exercises, a lacking variety in practice examples, which only reinforces familiarity with the specific examples, not the concepts.",1
edit: they've introduced a delay in skipping ads.,1
"the actual content is great, however in the past few years they have began charging money for many things that were previously free, and up the lingot prices for everything, downed the amount of lingots that are actually earned, and have limited you to only being able to make 5 mistakes before you have to pay to use the app or you need to wait 24+ hours to use it again.",1
"i am no longer a satisfied user of duolingo because of all the money charges, and excessive advertising for money charging",1
like the app but i find the font far to small and unable to make it bigger.,1
it's misleading when it says one can use it offline using the paid version.,1
"it needs to update itself all the time, so if there's no internet connection, there's nothing one can do.",1
"all the time there's an error message when one clicks on a lesson, to work, one needs to click a second time.",1
"sometimes the volume goes out, mid exersize.",1
"you can see the speaker animation, but the voice is mute.",1
the app is fine and i like the way it work but the hearts system is terrible and really keeps you from progressing.,1
my wife has the app on her phone and its great bc it doesnt have the hearts system.,1
being allowed 5 misteaks a day is insane.,1
nice concept but very buggy and zero customer support.,1
"the program for learning italian is badly explained (idioms and unusual constructs thrown in without any prior or later explanation ) , very repetitive (same examples over and over and over again until your autocorrect already learns them), contains some weird and frankly disturbing sentences for practice ('when do they die?",1
the users are left to each other for support and advice.,1
frustrated by the pressure to create a profile.,1
"nice application, however i got stock at one step of the game, where you have to pair sound with the word, sound doesn't play at one button and does not allow to continue",1
i'm trying to learn russian but it's trying to make me type in russian but my phone wont let me use a russian keyboard.,1
if you dont a keyboard for the language you want to learn(on your device)then dont download doulingo.,1
the hearts i use in learning my language never gets refilled and this has been happening for months even after i updated the app.,1
"the application does not work in portrait mode, and feedback is stuck in a loop via captcha to report it.",1
not useful when using a fixed keyboard,1
the new update is upsetting because the older version is cheaper and doesn't limit you with hearts.,1
"tech support is unresponsive, questions and comments get locked.",1
study material is not provided.,1
the material is very repetitive.,1
even though i finished first place in a league it didn't move me to the next league or give me any credit for my lessons i tried to report the issue but it denied it 4 time when trying to submit it so i gave up i refuse to pay for an app that i can't submit a problem to the company,1
poor app support.,1
the plus 'offline' feature does not work and i cannot get a refund for the 6 month subscription i paid Â£48 to use.,1
constantly asks about duolingo plus and referring a friend for a free week.,1
"however, upon referring a friend, no free week is given and the hounding over trying plus is more annoying than the ads.",1
"the actual app is very helpful, but once u get too many questions wrong u run out of hearts, so have to wait hours to go back on the app.",1
"shows i have a notification, but when i open the app amd look for a notification, there's nothing there.",1
and there's no way to get rid of the notification indication... annoying.,1
2. the same happened again. i was fifth of ten to get into the diamond league.. and i didn't get it again.. i wonder why they make the competition if they don't let you win!!!,1
"1. i am really mad, because i was eighth for the diamond league, and just when the countdown finished, it said that something went wrong and i did not get the level!!!",1
"don't let people compete i'd you are not going to give them the points, or the next level..",1
people abuse the practice lessons to gain xp to remain at the top of leaderboards which makes it unfair to the people who have updated apps and learn the legitimate way.,1
i would rate 5 stars if i didint have to deal with answering right several times and no matter what i enter it says im wrong!,1
or there wont be sound for the listening exorcises.,1
you took away my 311 day streak--even though i was equipped with a streak freeze!--just to try to force me to pay for streak repair!!,1
buggy interface on my android device makes replaying sounds frustrating because the app thinks you are selecting an answer.,1
"also the mic is unable to differentiate even simple ambient noise, making the spoken exercises impossible in anything other than a silent padded room.",1
poor app design.,1
"i finished all 12 units of japanese for school, just to get told that i haven't done the writing lessons, which aren't even available on the app!",1
"also, the speech recognition needs work.",1
"i've had several instances where i said the correct answer perfectly, and all the words lit up as correct, but then it gives me a red ""x"" and i have to say it again.",1
"i'm making no progress whatsoever, i'd recommend learning arabic a different way.",1
the microphone performance is extremely lousy.,1
"nor can you select or even see what input device is being used, if for example a bluetooth device is connected.",1
"thank you rosetta stone, for being the most expensive language learning app you have failed to deliver on the most critical feature.",1
it tries to offer the same functionality like the desktop but fails.,1
"the problems that i encountered are: 1.the pictures are too small, 2.is lacking functionality of the desktop version, 3.switching between japanese alphabets is a pain, 4.the app sometimes forgets the credentials, 5.it requires constant internet connection even if you choose to download the lesson.",1
"speech recognition sometimes works... for a product asking for so much money, i would expect more.",1
very sluggish pace.,1
"-animations take too much time, to the point where it's 30 seconds animation for 1 click.",1
the idea of the app is amazing but it's very hard without any english words to learn chinese!,1
sometimes i can't understand what those characters mean and it's very hard to use by the sound pinyan to translate them into english in google translator.,1
"not good for kids,it is very hard to recognize kids voice.",1
"i am try using this app with my 6 years son learn english,stuck at ""a girl is drinking"",i am try lot of times,include loud and whisper,adjust option to male or femaleï¼Œadjust sensitivity.all not work.still not recognize.",1
too expensive.,1
"but, you have to buy the app.",1
and it's not cheap.,1
imo it should be included in the (not cheap) price of the cd program.,1
way too expensive and not a great way to learn.,1
if you want to learn a language this app is good to instal but when you are learning the language it asks you to say a certain phrase but it always says that the audio is too loud.,1
app requires microphone lessons.,1
the software shouldn't only be pictures.,1
it should be a combination of their current software with spoken definitions.,1
"great language learing options but waaay to much money, honestly i prefer duolingo purely because it's free and you can complete all courses without paying, with rosetta, you can do two or three lessons and then you have to pay Â£100 a year.",1
it's not picking up my voice.,1
"i have emailed, tweeted but i don't get a response.",1
"not great for learning, audio technology is not great.",1
"cancelled my subscription on google play, but then got charged again through their website, with no way to contact them to get my $80 back.",1
the android app does not have translations.,1
i was saying the words exactly the same and each time it recorded something different.,1
i wasn't able to login in to my account on the mobile app.,1
after i forgot somthing it wouldn't lrt me do it again even though i used the reset button.,1
just pictures and the program saying words.,1
i bet its amazing but i can't afford it because i don't have the money for it (it's $94.99 a month),1
how do you close the app?,1
"mostly fit for people looking to learn the basics of a language quickly, maybe for a trip.",2
