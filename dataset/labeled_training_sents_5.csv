perfect app for learning new languages....although its not with languages that you need to advance in..... i recommend it to everyone i know ) btw its one of the best free apps i know...even when ur lives are out (they are 5) you can get more lives by practicing which is even better !,0
known as the elite language learning program for a reason ,0
i know how to order food in german however this program helps me learn the details with the german language.,0
have to guess the vocabulary once in a while but perhaps it was deliberate to keep users attention.,0
"if you give it serious time (not 5 minutes a day like they advertise, but more like an hour or two daily), this learning method actually works well to get you started with a language.",0
"amazing learning tool for those who want to set a foundation for learning a language, me personally chose russian and i feel like i am learning a good amount, you just need to dedicate time and effort, i also reccomend tiny cards and then follow the language you're learning to help practice and perfect the language of your choice.",0
hopefully i will have russian dialed in eventually.,0
just need to put in the work.,0
"overall, great free app and i love duolingo!!",0
!,0
a wonderful and revolutionary app.,0
wonderful to use before to study up for trip abroad.,0
"where's the app that makes learning history, math, or other subjects fun?!",0
thank you for your service and helping those who commit to continuous learning and growth.,0
an excellent language app.,0
fun to use.,0
"lessons depend on the category chosen & can be phrases in your home language & the language you are learning, write what you have heard, speak the phrase or word, enter missing words, vocabulary.",0
see which languages others are learning.,0
"complete as little or more daily or less frequently, easy to pick up again.",0
"but for a free app, that genuinely teaches you the language and how to spell and pronounce things correctly.",0
it is great.,0
there really are no shortcuts and you have to stick with it.,0
if you want to learn a language you can.,0
this app is great and makes it easy to get into your routine.,0
just beware of the owl if you leave your notifications on.,0
he will remind you.,0
i have been using the app for a week and so far is good.,0
i am relearning spanish and german and slowly starting italian.,0
"with many options, it's easy to learn a new language at your own pace.",0
this app is very fun and educational.,0
it makes learning a new language easy and fun!,0
i would give you 100 stars if i could.,0
i really appreciate this app.,0
"well, it is not a bad application... i mean, it is too similar to a game but if you pay attention and follow the advices the app itself gives (read each lesson out loud and write the new vocabulary you learn after practicing), then you will probably get the basic knowledge such as sounds and simples vocabulary.",0
"so, it is recommended to beginners but you can't stop here.",0
i would highly recommend this as a method of learning a second language.,0
i have learnt more grammar in a very short period than i have with other language learning software.,0
love duolingo and my portuguese is getting so much better!,0
"other than that, this app is absolutely great!",0
the two languages are so similar and it would be much easier to learn being italian my first language!),0
very nice app.,0
there are a lot of things that might be useful if you are learning new language.,0
"it is easy, funny and useful.",0
highly recommended this app when you are learning either at home or outside.,0
this surely is the best free language learning app available.,0
it makes learning real easy and fun.,0
plus it keeps you motivated and its just amazing.,0
you can set the bar low but when you start you almost dont want to quit.,0
so in my opinion its definitely worth a try!,0
"duolingo is a great app for learning, absolute 5 stars, its great, i love it, the lessons are very intriguing and i love, just love the cute little animations on the lessons, when i'm doing my japanese lessons, i always loved the lessons little pictures, but those little animations are perfect!",0
yes.,0
"it's really good and allows a varied method of teaching , i love the competition with xp and story mode.",0
so helpful for learning a language.,0
best app for this i've found.,0
a very enjoyable app.,0
"a wonderful learning platform.......step by step lessons.....enough of practice to make you remember everything that you have learnt.....it teaches you reading, writing, speaking, listening, all of them.....and the best is all of this is completely free......must use app",0
this app is fantastic!,0
"you learn to read, speak, and write the words!",0
"if you run low on health, you can practice to gain hearts!",0
this app is amazing and i recommend it to anyone wanting to learn a new language(s)!,0
two thumbs waaaaay way up!,0
ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»,0
this app is truly amazing.,0
you can learn a whole new language just by practicing everyday.,0
this app is very helpful and i feel that i can become fluent in the language i am learning using this app and this app alone.,0
i absolutely love it!,0
it would help with trying to remember words without having to be in lessons.,0
"other than that, i absolutely love the app.",0
it has helped me so much!,0
i can get by in french and am using duolingo to get up to date.,0
"between the app and the website, you've got yourself a perfectly useful way to learn languages any time and just about anywhere.",0
and free?!,0
yes!!!,0
no catches.,0
you can bang out a few good lessons while on the toilet... or waiting for the bus... or in any short moment that you get throughout the day.,0
the key is to stick with it and let it's game-style structure show you the way.,0
i was impressed in how the app manages to integrate so many methods and functions for becoming comfortable with a foreign language.,0
maybe in the future?,0
"thank you to the developers for a great, free tool!",0
"the app lets you get into a new language rather randomly, but in a great speed.",0
well done!,0
"great app in gratis mode, even better when you pay :)",0
amazing.,0
"i'm using the app to learn japanese from english currently, and although it's definitely suited for teaching spanish, french, and german, it's still the best way to learn japanese that i've found that actually gives you the whole language for free as well as teaches you both how to speak the language and how to read it.",0
most japanese learning apps i've used only do one or the other.,0
i highly recommend this app.,0
it's simple a simple enough app.,0
"i'm not far into the app yet, but it seems good so far!",0
some things can be frustrating but that's more due to the lessons than the app itself.,0
"if you enjoy duolingo, this app is for you",0
this app helps me so much!,0
i've made so much progress over the last 2 years and i love everything about it!,0
thank so much for creating duolingo!!!,0
!,0
!,0
easy and fun for all ages.,0
my girls all have the app and we are learning as a family.,0
"we are learning a new language for fun, and fun is what we are getting out of this learning app.",0
thanks,0
free and really works!,0
i started taking spanish in the 3rd grade and all through school and struggled greatly barely passing or worse and could never retain anything i learned.,0
i dont know how this app works but suddenly i am remembering words and am able to use them and have real conversations in spanish.,0
i'm learning a lot from this app.,0
like when i translate something or pick the correct translated word.,0
be careful of typos!,0
duolingo is helpful in learning a new language.,0
it is not the only tool you should use but it is a great tool.,0
one the best apps for language learning i have came across.,0
currently learning spanish and maintained a 6 month streak so far.,0
"you will appreciate the efficiency, fun methods and great flexible features that it provides.",0
very highly recommended,0
honestly amazing!,0
"this app only take 5 minutes for each lesson, (depending on how fast you complete the lesson) its easy to use and it's for free!",0
and that's a great price.,0
:),0
brilliant way to learn spanish.,0
it drills it into your subconscious while also explaining the grammar.,0
"very helpful, and they've definitely made improvements over the years.",0
"love the app, really thankful that it's free!",0
great app!,0
lessons move at a steady pace without being overwhelming.,0
i just love this app.,0
does not work all the time.,0
so easy to learn.,0
"doing some spanish, portuguese and a ltle italian.ðŸ˜",0
please fix it,0
great so far!,0
i feel like this is one of the best self study apps.,0
this has helped me learn some languages in an attention grabbing way,0
extremely simple and practical.,0
"i find myself doing a little practice every day effortlessly, even with multiple languages added.",0
very useful for maintaining and developing competence in my second languages.,0
"duolingo is a ""mucky"" way to learn a language: it requires you to largely work out the rules of the target language yourself, but that is exactly what babies and toddlers do.",0
it is just one tool among the many which you need to use to learn a new language.,0
it has flaws but don't treat the course seriously.,0
serious studies are elsewhere.,0
"great, utterly and simply great.",0
love damn near everything about it and then you switch over to a desktop version and it gets even better.,0
what are you waiting for download it now and get started!!!,0
!,0
love it.,0
im learning so much.,0
i might not be able to speak fluently but i can read and understand what others say.,0
and i can speak a little of it.,0
try it.,0
it really is.,0
this is quickly becoming one of my favorite activities.,0
it's surprisingly adept at building preserved memories of the subject matter.,0
i really love this app and it really helps me with my language skills.,0
i really recommend this app if you want to learn a language easily and enjoyably!,0
"love this app, not complicated & easy to undertstand and use for beginners.",0
im doing french.,0
really enjoying learning spanish with duolingo.,0
recommended,0
"well, i'm hooked!",0
downloaded this app to learn how to speak a bit of german for when i go to berlin soon and it's fantastic!,0
"only con - so many languages and so little time :p. they are also always improving the app, taking in feedback.",0
sign of good developers and project management.,0
glad i gave it a shot.,0
working on an 18 day streak so far!,0
"great language app, especially as it's free.",0
"i overthink things personally and this app definitely just helps me move along, erasing all questions i may have.",0
the lessons are understandable and fun.,0
5 stars all the way!ðŸ˜„,0
"its amazing, i only got it for 5 minutes so far and already know quite a lot of words.",0
i have tried a few language apps and so far this one is the best head and shoulders above the others.,0
im on a 2 week streak and dont see myself stopping.,0
i like that they respect a user like that,0
it is really good!,0
i am beginning to enjoy the app.,0
i find that little difficult ðŸ˜• to do it just be listening!,0
!,0
the most amazing app on play store.,0
delivered much more than what i expected.,0
and that's for free.,0
i look forward to my 15 min everyday!,0
i'm also an elearning developer and i'm very impressed with the innovative and fun learning features!,0
thank you duolingo!,0
i wish there were more companies out there like you!,0
i'm grateful!,0
its a great app!,0
it helps you understand the words you are struggling on!,0
"i'm learning japanese, i'd recommend this to my friends!",0
incredible .fun.,0
me encanta duolingo .,0
very good app when learning basic word and phrases.you could learn and try or you could just be a liar and right a bad review.for me it helped a lot with my french test and english plus turkish.i would give it 10 stars but 5 should jumpstart it.,0
"download it know if u want to speak like a pro.learn with duo the owl and speak like a legend or be there and read boring books about languages which are 200pg long.dualingo's moto should be ''learn today, speak tommorrow.''",0
download it for extra help.,0
this app is amazing!,0
i'd recommend it to anyone!,0
it's an amazing way to learning a language with free and fun.,0
love it!,0
as someone who studied languages all through school and never felt like i made any progress i have been delighted with how much progress i have made with duolingo.,0
i would definitely recommend!,0
this way you can associate the word with the written word.,0
just like reading.,0
"it's like the perfect learning structure, it's awesome, i've learned and processed more words in just a few lessons as a beginner than i ever thought i would!",0
"it's been 50 min, first impressions so far the app is amazing.",0
super helpful for learning a language.,0

i'm trying to learn spanish and duolingo makes it super easy.,0
i took 4 years of spanish in highschool so the bits i remember have helped me too but i feel like i'm learning actually important words and phrases through this app.,0
this app is marvel and has helped my learning in german a lot.,0
it has some odd quirks occasionally but over for it is fabulous as a free app.,0
love this app.,0
great supplement for reviewing things i've learned in class.,0
would definitely recommend it.,0
i love it because it's a fun and easy way to learn a language.,0
that's why it's a 5 star rating.,0

great way to introduce them to a different language,0
i love learning languages on this app it is very useful.,0

it's great...i did not know any arabic but duo has day to day words that are spoken...now i have travelled to riyadh city and it's no trouble getting what people are saying in arabic at all...,0
i'm really learning!,0
thanks for making this app.,0
super useful!,0
i currently use duolingo to improve my japanese language lesson.,0
i cant give you five thumbs up because i dont have enough fingers.,0
jk.,0
but still love this.ðŸ‘keep foward!,0
brilliant!,0
great methods of teaching .,0
steady competition along with coaching makes learning fun.,0
"fairly new to this, but i'm enjoying my experience so far.",0
"i'm not a quick learner, so maybe it's me and not the app.",0
even then most of the time it doesn't work.,0
i really like how much information i am retaining.,0
"i can't stress how much i high recommend this to everybody, i wanted to give the app 6 stars!!",0
!,0
"honestly a great way to learn, considering it's an app.",0
this app is amazing !!!,0

"if there would be option, i would give it 10 stars.",0
i have learnt italian language from this app.,0
and i recommend to install this app ðŸ˜ðŸ¤—,0
i love this!,0
"makes it so easy to learn,and you can revise things over again!",0
it's so flexible!,0
great!!,0
!,0
makes learning easy to understand.,0
i paid for babble for a year and hardly used it.,0
it always felt like a chore and it didn't seem worth the cost (especially since i've had to stop working because of health issues).,0
fastforward to finding duolingo: now this is an app i can get into!,0
the format feels like a real game and not a lesson.,0
i really have a chance to improve now!,0
thanks duo!,0
ðŸ˜Š,0
"nice app, progress at your own pace.",0
i like the different sections i.e.,0
"travel, food, etc",0
i'm definitely benefitting and learning spanish quickly.,0
im learning french to better communicate with my wonderful love and so far this app has been helping me better than any class i've ever been in.,0
i highly recommend this for anyone wanting to learn additional languages.,0
amazing language learning app.,0
i love the app style and hope they keep it like that.,0
again a brilliant app and the teaching system is great.,0
the app has really helped me with learning new languages.,0
"the league system also helps, as it encourages you to do more lessons.",0
"you can get a new skin for duo with them, and occasionally you can buy extra lessons with them, but other than that, they don't feel very important or useful.",0
"i feel like i should spend them, but there's nothing to spend them on.",0
so far this app is the best resource i have had for learning languages.,0
i love this app.,0
i'm currently studying japanese.,0
"i used separate apps to learn katakana on my own, but it'd be nice if i didn't have to use multiple apps.",0
"anyhow, this app is great.",0
thanks duolingo!,0
great way to learn or improve your language skills...for free!,0
it's a close friend of mine for about five years now.,0
but recently i have a unbelievable problem with it.,0
i am trying to fix this problem because it's not so easy to forget this friend so soon.,0
i hope it will be fixed in the next update.,0
(please!),0
"it's really helpful and easy to use, my english improved a lot after that i started using this app, i really recommend",0
great app.,0
this app is ideal to learn a new language.,0
even if you are not a native speaker you can easily speak that language fluently within a span of a few months.,0
great app.,0
"ads are never fun, but they've got to make money somehow from us freeloaders.",0
"learn to write, speak, and hear from a multitude of languages.",0
best language app i've ever used with great incentives.,0
teaches as well as a a face to face class.,0
i love this app so far!,0
i'm trying to learn japanese and for the basics it's really making it easy to study.,0
i like it very much.,0
5 stars is not enough.,0
it's a great app and i have learnt a lot of french from this app.,0
"overall, this is a wonderful app and i have been using it for a long time.",0
so easy and fun.,0
very good app.,0
this is absolutely amazing.,0
"i wanted to learn japanese, just to add some fun into my life, and it's working perfectly!",0
thank you for it being free!,0
"this is probably a common complaint, but i usually hit the stop ads with super duo on accident.",0
thank you!,0
i love the app.,0
an absolutely phenomenal educational application.,0
"while many sites and courses build their content on technical levels, with everything being taught as machine-like and algorithmic, duolingo is a breath of fresh air that truly attempts to imbibe fluency in its users.",0
"it's the difference between translating ""je suis content(e)"" to ""i am happy"" and understanding ""je suis content(e)"" as ""je suis content"".",0
"to any one searching for an aid to learning language, with ample practice, duo is the way.",0
the best way to learn a new language that i've ever tried!,0
"i am not good at learning languages, but i actually find myself remembering the lessons from duolingo whereas i never could remember anything using other methods.",0
overall love it though!,0
the best language learning application i have ever used.,0
it's free and the material is fantastically done to help you learn fast and remember.,0
it has a huge list of languages.,0
there is one ad at the end of each lesson.,0
so they dont bug you every second.,0
definitely worth more than 5 stars.,0
"a amazing app for language learning,easy to use and free!there are some ads, obviously,but you can buy a ""paid version"" to remove those ads;despite that, it's a fantastic app,i would recommend it for anyone who is interested in learn a language.",0
i love duolingo!,0
i especially like two aspects of learning with duolingo.,0
"this is best app for learning languages, it is easy and so fun to learn, i love it",0
i love this app.,0
it's amazing and we can learn any language for free.,0
it awesome i would definitely share this to everyone,0
i'm learning a lot of vocabulary and verb conjugations.,0
it's fun and easy.,0
"i'm really enjoying my ""duo"" time!",0
"i've been using this app for years, starting with the duolingo website version.",0
"i haven't always stuck with my lessons, but when i have i've made noticeable progress in my chosen language.",0
"even when i stopped for over a year, i hadn't forgotten what i learned.",0
"duolingo uses the same method as the very expensive rosetta stone computer software (immersion), and they do it for free.",0
absolutely 5 stars.,0
i have never got such an experience from a language learning application before.,0
i have been using it for something like over a week and overall i still am amazed at how it makes me want to learn new things each day sometimes multiple times a day.,0
"an easy and productive way to learn, practice and experience languages.",0
i really like the fact that duolingo in general has improved.,0
"(keeping streaks, setting your daily challenge) overall, i find it a good tool to help learn a language, not entirely sure whether it can teach the language completely but at the very least, it is a very good stepping stool.",0
amazing app that helps learn languages for free.,0
"i can't believe this app, this is free(like literally), very very easy to go with and this is some high quality stuff..",0
the fastest and easiest way to learn a new language!,0
"five days into the week, i have 150 or so xp.",0
i'm in 26th.,0
second and third sit at about 350 xp.,0
even placing high enough to advance to the fourth bracket is pretty involved.,0
"i expected the character to be wearing it all the time through the app, not just when it peeked in during lessons.",0
otherwise i feel it was a waste of gems to purchase them.,0
p.s.,0
please find a way to turn down the volume on it.,0
"i have 70000+xp in spanish, and 4000+ in french, yet i hated this app more that i liked it.",0
"just my fondness for languages, and it being free (i'm frugal) kept bringing me back.",0
loved it!,0
i think i can endure the ads now.,0
good work team!,0
much more effective than using a physical language book.,0
"really nice app, very advanced learning system.",0
i love this app for a few reasons.,0
love it!,0
this website helped me keep an a in my language classes end after i finish my glasses i was able to get even better at the same witches and even learn more.,0
i would definitely recommend this to any students and people who just simply want to learn another language.,0
this app is amazing.,0
"it helps cram the words in my mind, and even gives pro tips!",0
"for example: ""yo soy juan.""",0
"the 'yo' is not needed, since 'soy' already means 'i am'.",0
"i'm just assuming that you might say 'yo soy' to be more formal, maybe?",0
that's what i don't know.,0
"otherwise, 5 stars!",0
the way duolingo teaches is very good and shows you many sentence examples that will help you make your own in your language of choice.,0
"although there are times that it feels grindy, but that's how you actually learn the language and be able to speak and write it.",0
"i think the offline feature is worth purchasing, too.",0
if you want to practice languages anywhere efficiently i highly recommend this one!,0
it's surprisingly simple to use with its neat design and layout unlike many apps.,0
the best free language learning app i've come across.,0
"duolingo is the nearest to being entirely free since the free version includes full capacity of all its lessons, while other programs don't let you access full lessons for free.",0
i love this app!,0
it helped me learn spanish.,0
my friend sophia starting learning danish as well on this app!,0
i need to give this app more than 5 stars!,0
ðŸ˜ƒ,0
lots of mobile games have rewards for logging in daily and still that doesn't motivate me to do so nearly as much as this app does.,0
i'm currently on a 100 day streak and have used it every day =d.,0
edit 1: still going strong.,0
excellent app!,0
it's been incredibly helpful.,0
"and as a lesbian, it was wonderful to see a story involving two women on their honeymoon!",0
thanks so much duo team!,0
Â¡mucho gusto!,0
duolingo is a way of learning languages and doing so in the go.,0
but it's more than reading the words.,0
"therefore, if you want to brush up on a new language or refresh after some time away from speaking that language, duolingo is the best app to date...a modern day rosetta stone for the digital age.",0
i love this app.,0
it's very easy to build up skills on any language through the apps as it guide you systematical way .,0
"it's nice app to start learning a foreign language...easy , interactive and engaging",0
great way of learning languages!!,0
definitely recommend it!,0
!,0
"it helps you listen, speak, read and write and when you need more real communications, you can join events at your neighborhood.",0
love it a lot.,0
i personally love it it's a nice language learning app but to really benefit you must use it regularly,0
great experience and a fun way to learn.,0
thank you!,0
highly reccomend.,0
endures that you correct your mistakes.,0
would recommend.,0
awesome experience.,0
it gets the job done slowly but surely.,0
anyone determined can learn a language for free!,0
i highly recommend duolingo to anyone.,0
"accessible, effective, and fun.",0
"good variety of ways to practice, with the option to test out of basic levels when ready.",0
"awards for ""streaks,"" consistency, etc.",0
"ads appear regularly in the free version, between lessons, clearly identified.",0
"well designed app, that works very efficiently and which has finally made some basic rules of latin stick in my memory.",0
"i stated from nothing and i'm learning very quickly, enjoying it all along.",0
i've been learning for nearly two months now and still enjoying it a lot.,0
this app is by far one of the best things i've ever downloaded.,0
"not only has duo convinced me to stop wasting time watching brain-dead youtube videos, i can now actually speak in a different language!",0
"also the whole stories feature is great as it gives a fairly good simulation of how conversations are held, which in turn is vital for becoming proficient in a language.",0
fun and easy to use.,0
very practical for language learning.,0
duolingo is the best free language learning app i've used.,0
it's efficient for what it is and is still growing as they update it.,0
i'm actually learning.,0
thoroughly enjoy!,0
a very smart app.,0
i like the app they make it easy and fun to learn and they really work with you in trying to progress.,0
absolutely amazing!,0
i love this app.,0
it makes learning languages fun and effective.,0
lots of fun and learning a new skill.,0
really great.,0
duolingo is a really good app.,0
it was recommended by one of my friend.,0
easy to use and understand the system as well.,0
such a great app.,0
makes learning fun n and approachable!,0
i'm hooked :),0
pretty good app.,0
"so, you don't improve on the wee words!!",0
"otherwise, am enjoying and am learning.",0
great app.,0
although i am just at the beginning stages of learning it is fun and informative,0
otherwise great.,0
i'm also learning new ways to say things in languages i was already familiar with.,0
most seem to miss that aspect of duolingo and get upset when they are immediately asked about words and phrases they don't know.,0
"i love this app i am learning french, spanish and welsh and i never dreamed of learning any language.",0
if you want feedback i would add little games in between to help you and to know what you struggle with.,0
download it now !!!,0
â¤ï¸ðŸ“±â¤ï¸ðŸ“±â¤ï¸ðŸ“±â¤ï¸ðŸ“±â¤ï¸ðŸ“±â¤ï¸ðŸ“±â¤ï¸,0
great way to learn or refresh a language.,0
it is super easy to use the free version.,0
also to practice to re up your health.,0
i am practicing ukrainian.,0
i have a friend who first language is ukraine.,0
he says it is good.,0
so far it is a good app.,0
i will update my rating after further use.,0
i am rated 21 in ranking so far.,0
:),0
i've been hooked on this for a few days now.,0
"i've lived in china for a few years, minored in japanese in college, and had a couple of awesome russian roommates.",0
this app is great for touching up on languages i haven't spoken in a while and has been teaching me russian at a surprising pace (cyrillic is no joke).,0
not a big deal.,0
"oh, and it's 100% free",0
solid start in duolingo.,0
"started with spanish, to which i did have some previous experience learning.",0
though it never really took back then.,0
it seems to be taking now.,0
"not sure yet if that's because of the previous base and the ten thousandth time is the charm for me, or if these short, repetitive, simple lessons really help build an understanding.",0
i'm willing to give duolingo the credit!,0
the app is also good and very well done.,0
"i've a fair bit of language learning experience, and duolingo is very good indeed.",0
"i've always laughed at courses with almost-nonsensical sentences (eg, ""the blue mouse is in the tram""), but such tests make you think about *every* word, and not just guess by context.",0
"i do some every day, and am nearly 8 months in the hungarian course, and i'm loving it.",0
"thanks, duolingo owl, you're the best.",0
"i only got this a few days ago but so far it's been engaging, encouraging and overall pleasantly educative.",0
loved it.. easy to learn and systematic approach to build fundamentals.,0
it takes time to learn and remember the language so i've learnt that you need to be patient with the app as you won't learn it in 2 weeks but it could be months the more you use it.,0
the course is simple to follow and the forum allows for queries to be answered.,0
there are some who compound more points than time allows and this stops targets being achieved.,0
"but, this course is still the best for learning a language and not just basic conversational ability.",0
i have recommended duolingo and there is now a group of six of us studying together.,0
"this is a great app, and so far, i've been learning russian and progressing very well.",0
it would really help if that was added.,0
otherwise an amazing app!,0
"i've always wanted to learn a foreign language, but i thought it would be difficult.",0
this app teachers in such a way that keeps you interested.,0

the methods work very well for me.,0

if you plan on actually learning a language this app is wonderful.,0
"take in mind when you were in first grade learning you had note cards and studied in class to ""learn"".",0
if you have the same mindset with this app i feel the results will be wonderful.,0
so if you loose all your 5 hearts for the time(they refill) thats were you should study and learn were and why you messed up or forgot.,0
i love this app!!!,0
basically skip rosetta stone and go for something that is better and freeðŸ˜‰,0
"5 stars so far, it's really helpful.",0
"although it gets tiring tryna learn things and it just repeats, but i have a bad memory so it's really good for me.",0
"different people have different ways of learning, but duolingo takes it slow and easy for easy learning.",0
"thank you to the creators, you did good.",0
this app is honestly so amazing.,0
i would recommend taking notes with each lesson so you can refer to them whenever you need them.,0

this is one of the best free apps.,0
"for someone who has learned languages before, this app is great for me.",0

languages have too many words to just relay on one program for vocabulary.,0
a really great app to help learn a language or two.,0

"hey duolingo, i'm writing to make a suggestion & i hope that you'll read it.",0
3 things i'd like to see available in lessons.,0
1.),0

they can't be making that much on me watching rewarded video ads but the pro option feels like too much money.,0
"super amazing, this app is indeed a free and awesome way to learn languages.",0
super fun way to brush up on a language or learn a new one.,0

good job with the new feature!,0
helps me comprehend and try to apply what i learned from my previous lessons â˜ºï¸,0
this app is amazing!,0

they definitely can keep all those ads though,0
the best beginner/intermediate language-learning app!,0
i can see what all the hype is about now.,0
i can't tell if i'm actually understanding a new language any better than before.,0
"but, it's fun.",0
most language learners give up because they don't seem to have enough free time to learn.,0
even 5 minutes a day can assure progress or at least not to forget what you have already learnt.,0

i was going to give 4 stars but realized it's not the program...it's me.,0
yikes!,0
"i haven't utilized the app to its fullest, but what i've used so far has been good.",0
i like that it's pass/fail with pronunciation because that's where i struggle the most.,0
i've ignored most of them (haha) but it does plant the seed and today i started lessons again.,0
hopefully will stick with it :-/,0
well done!!!,0
great app,0
can you guys give me probably some discount please?,0
good to improve language,0

"the app is great, everything here has the fantastic sense of helping people improving their english skills... i mean it's really good!",0
just try it,0
"it was was easy to learn and fun, i enjoyed it!",0
its rosetta stone.,0
the number one language learning program in the world.,0
of course deserves 5 stars.,0
takes time to learn and i like the way it goes through the steps.,0
it is challenging but when i can't complete a task there are options to open 'windows' with translations (for instance) for further guidance.,0
i feel i've learnt so much in just one hour!,0
great!,0
just keep practicing!,0
best app in learning any languages!,0
very easy to follow!,0
great addition to my day.,0
easy and fun to use.,0
very easy.. highly recommended,0
wonderful having so much fun,0
it's a great tool to practice stuff that you already know and to learn some new stuff,0
this app teaches basics without telling you exactly what to say and you pretending to memorize.,0
"even after a few days of not doing it, i still can remember what i learned previously because of the unique way it is taught.",0
easy to learn with this app.,0
"even if i can't do that particular exercise right then, i shouldn't be hurried past.",0
"other than that, excellent app!",0
i understand some spanish already.,0
"the app doesn't provide traditional methods taught in school; the app makes you think about what you are saying with several visual examples, and also helps measure your understanding and pronunciation with each example.",0
"i use it daily to help brush up on my comprehension and application of spanish, and i recommend this app for anyone looking to learn a second language.",0
i love this app and want to share it with my son,0
update after a 3 months of use: this is the best app i've ever come across for learning a different language.,0
it's immersive and intuitive and i will most certainly be continuing with my subscription.,0
that's just nitpicking though.,0
10-Oct,0
very well-designed.,0
rosetta stone makes it easier to progress then any other program i have seen.,0
well this is fun!,0
but of course we need to buy it to get better access.,0
good thing i already know some greek and everything doesn't seem that overwhelming ðŸ˜‰ looking forward to explore more,0
"j'accuse the app, mais it's right.",0
lol.,0
"i have my 2nd language proficiency in french, but for certain words it kept x'ing me.",0
my speech was just too elongated).,0
"i *wish* the app had given clues, because i was gettin' real t.o.",0
'ed at the app.,0
"however, for not being a live human, this robot does remarkabley well and my confidence in the grammar's improving too!",0
"this app is great for learning a language, fast.",0
"i would highly recommend this app to a friend, or family.",0
you can learn so many words in such a small amount of time.,0
thanks rosetta stone for helping me to learn italian everyday.,0
very effective in teaching pronunciation.,0
there are just two flaws.,0
really good for getting you speaking the language and recognizing characters.,0
core lessons go a little fast but smaller specific lesssons let you practice things like pronunciation of the syllables.,0
i like that it tells you of you are pronouncing something wrong.,0
"if my opinion changes with further use, i'll update this rating.",0
really great when paired with other learning programs/books/material.,0
the audio is great to listen to in the car on the way to work for extra listening comprehension work!,0
awesome learning tool,0
great app.,0
"haven't gotten very far into it yet, but i'm already learning so much.",0
"instead of learning to translate it over to my first language which is english, i learned to associate the language that i'm learning with pictures.",0
great way to sharpen skills.,0
outstanding method of learning,0
was not so hard a little issue with my pronouncation,0
"if you don't mind paying, this ap has the best learning outside of complete immerson.",0
"the written word is not for beginners, though.",0
"you may need another ap to learn hangul letters, chinese or japanese.",0
such neat educational technology development that is organized and super effective in producing results!,0
easy to use and fun,0
i usually use the laptop version because i think this method gets more effective by seeing larger picture and in a quiet room.,0
"however, for the use of the audio clips on the way, the app version is useful.",0
thanks for the steady updates.,0
i really enjoyed learning japanese here.,0
it's more like a project based learning method than normal methods learning from recognizing the alphabet.,0
i think it will be more efficient for one to master a language.,0
good luck.,0
absolutely incredible.,0
you will surprise yourself with how fast and quick you will learn the basics of the language.,0
spanish in my case.,0
the structure of the learning process is done in a unique way.,0
you will cruise seamlessly throughout the learning units.,0
"in short, the best of them all!",0
i've used most of all the other apps but none of them can be compared to even the half of rosetta stone.,0
"good , but only one lesson.",0
"i have utilized several, at least 5 different methods to learn hebrew, including those with personal teacher interaction -- as well as having researched over a dozen other methods before purchasing; yet, i have found rosetta stone incredibly far more effective than any other method -- also, though i've formally studied both spanish & russian, hebrew is not an easy language for an american to learn, i have been surprised at how well through rosetta stone that in a short time i've already...",0
i studied german in the past and was able to use up to unit 9 in review.,0
for me this is a great resource.,0
"the noun declination, prepositions, sentence structures and verb congegations can be confusing to a novice.",0
great if you want an easy way to learn the app is what you are looking for.,0
so easy to pull out my phone and start learning.,0
thank you,0
pretty awesome if you'd ask me.,0
right off the back i decided this was the right choice for me.,0
"there are a bunch of free apps, but you really get your money's worth, learning with rosetta.",0
rosetta stone is one of the best apps to learn english.,0
very educational and easy to learn the basics can't wait to learn more thank you rosetta stone.,0
i have been using rossesta stone on and off for about seven years and i find their system to be relaxing and helpful.,0
i have struggled in language courses in school but the rosseta stone aprpoach has boosted my confidence!,0
i use it for free through my local library.,0
rosetta stone provides the best service ever.,0
"they do all the work for you, just sit back and learn!",0
the learning process is not overwhelming with complexities yet very reasonable with advances in the target language.,0
you are missing out big time if you dont try this.,0
simply incredible!,0
"this is more if a refresher for me, just started using this app and so far i like it a lot.",0
want to be fluent in speaking spanish and so far i think this will be able to help in me being able to have everyday conversations with people and getting a better grasp with certain words.,0
really good and help me learn as much as possible,0
it would be better if it was for free,0
very helpful and useful.,0
i use it along with formal class setting.,0
helps with grammar and speech.,0
learning tools extremely helpful with speaking !,0
!love being able to review at any time or place.,0
"otherwise, it has been very helpful fir keeping up on my practice, and syncs with my computer account!",0
very wasy to use.,0
i am already learning how to speak my picked (spanish) language.,0
i started of not paying for it then loved it so much i had to.,0

free trial is worth it!!,0
!,0
hi i'm a student in secondary school who is taking a gcse in french and i was seeking some tutoring type help to improve as i was struggling and not as good as i would have liked to be.,0
rosetta stones has really improved my french and i feel more confident than ever in french.,0
the tutoring sessions are ideal if your wondering and is definitely worth the money.,0
"you get around 10 sessions per month of 25 minutes of each, and you can choose the time that you need with extra nice tutors.",0
throws you into a language quickly and efficiently .,0
it is a very well designed app.,0
i really like the app.,0
"just a couple of questions, tagalog doesn't seem to have the phrase book that i can see other languages have?",0
it might take a little more to grasp the meaning of words but surely makes you learn faster in the long run.,0
great app.,0
i'm learning faster than i ever have on other language apps.,0
i'm not too far in but i feel like my brain is already trying to translate and remember the stuff i'm learning.,0
teaches characters also,0
really enjoying using this app.,0
it is helping me learn a lot.,0
however it is not a replacement for speaking the language with a native speaker.,0
that's where you really learn!,0
i like being able to use rosetta stone anywhere.,0
fantastic use of technology.,0
the app is just as effective as the computer program.,0
"easy to use, very self-explanatory, and fun.",0
there are more lessons available for free than i expected!,0
"challenging, but rewarding.",0
"i am using this along with other means to learn german, but this is the base of my learning and works well as that.",0
"if i had known how well this works with such little time invested each day, i would have been doing this for years.",0
pretty good.,0
good at picking up spoken words.,0
best language app ever.,0
"i have tried almost every app out there and every grammar book, and language book, everything you can think of.",0

no complex grammar exercises.,0
love using the app at any time for however long i've got.,0
the learning style is very easy to get along with and way more enjoyable than a school lesson .,0

it's a incredible app for learner english!,0
it's s very cool!,0
great app and amazing learning experience!,0
love this!,0
i think this is a great way to learn new languages.,0
"for people like me who has a passion for learning new languages online,our options are really limited(and often unhelpful).",0
well this app changes all that.,0
this is a great app designed to enhance your now limited linguistic abilities.,0
learn any language.,0
"requirements: working vocal chords, eyes, and ears.",0

outstanding language teaching app!,0
excelent app!,0
before apps people had to go to a class or hire a private tutor to learn a language.,0
"so mcuh easier to learn a language now, especially wirh rosetta stone.",0
"so far i think this app is super easy to use, highly interactive,and educational.",0
it seems like great way to pick up a second language.,0
finally bit the bullet... after a couple years with duolingo and babble decided to spend the money in hopes this would stick better.,0
rosetta stone is the bomb.,0
still new so i'll update later but so far it is hands down a more effective way to learn.,0
very user friendly.,0

easy to use.,0
i feel as though the manner in which i am being tought allows me to retain the information much better compared to traditional methods.,0
absolutely the most amazing app i have ever had.,0
very easy and fun.,0
i never thought i could learn french especially in a short time but i can now.,0
very straightforward and easy to use!,0
i really liked it and if i wasn't a poor student i would gladly pay for the full version.,0
i love this app it's super helpful and fun.,0
my favorite part is saying the words in the new language!,0
"if you need an app that provides great on-the-go language practice, this is the one for you!",0

will never go back!,0
definately give it a shot!,0
especially great for keeping the basic skills sharp.,0
i take spanish at a university but it's always moving forward.,0

it is very helpfull it took my a month to learn i new lanwage,0
so far i'm learning more then ever!,0
the way it teaches is like no other language class there is!,0
the best language learning app on android,0
i'm learning alot in a short time.,0
.,0
sometimes i put in an answer that should be accepted but it's not for some reason that happens once in ~150 questions or so.,1
in all honesty the adds get annoying.,1
quick update: i wish it told you how many minutes and hours total you have been practicing.,1
"when i lose all my lives, i just want to keep going!",1
don't know what happened though but after one of the recent updates i can't reorder the words in word bank mode anymore.,1
also the tests to skip a level are sometimes too easy with most translations providing the word bank!,1
(wish there was a portuguese from italian!,1
it's really addictive and if you are competitive person you have to be careful.,1
"but one thing, i wish japanese lessons had stories, it would make everything so much more interesting!",1
but i would like to make a suggestion: it would make it very simple for me at least if there was a dictionary of the language i'm learning in the app.,1
"learning with this interactive environment beats all other methods in my opinion, and i wish that duolingo would take the lessons to even more advanced levels as well.",1
"one extra plus is the sensible approach to audio support: when audio is not a good idea, you can practice with text only.",1
"can't be used by itself for language learning, but as a supplement it is my favorite app.",1
"this app is very helpful i am in the process of learning two languages french and welsh but as any apps need improvement i would like to change two things 1:having more lifes 2: a word bank for you chosen languages for example once completing a lesson tue words from there go into a ""dictonary"" which will help for memory and revision thanks for reading this and creating duolingo!",1
"not bad for a beginner to learn a language, but i think you should add more relatively content to he language between people in the streets, the words that the people use in their daily life, although, it's a perfect application, keep it up !",1
my one gripe is i wish there was more verbal feedback so i can here what i'm learning.,1
they do give tips for why you got a question wrong are too few.,1
you should also use a dual language dictionary and books in your target language.,1
another great help would be a totally immersive experience and/or a native language speaker.,1
"the program is great, but the sound of pronunciation and repetition of words after the basic stage is muted and the practice of repeating the words has become difficult.",1
pls add more items in the store because i'm losing my motivation after buying everything.,1
wish you could always make them repeat the sentences or words even after having correct answer.,1
this app is great but lately it's had a bug i guess and its voice does not work.,1
you can't hear anything and this is such a bummer because i really liked this app.,1
i wish that it had more explanations for things and also that it had a way of looking back at a bank of all the words you've learned.,1
i would be willing to pay a one off fee for unlimited but not monthly.,1
"some sentences are a bit silly (eg ""i'm not an apple"") but overall could only recommend.",1
"it's a great app, it's a masterpiece and i guess the app was really planned very well, but please you guys should add the feature where we can chat with other followers in different languages from different countries.",1
"it's awesome but recently the sound doesn't work, i think it's just in my country, iran,that's a pity, i hope it will come back,it's impossible to continue with out the true pronunciation!",1
"lately,i cant load the audio,but not always,when i have to hear a sentence and write it down,it just doesn't play the audio,or for new words,i dont know what to do!",1
but some tips on pronouncing would be helpful.,1
my kindly request to add arabic and urdu language course and also the stories (for reading) and dictionary options in the application.,1
"makes learning languages easy, unless it uses a different alphabet.",1
however recently the listening exercises have been quite unclear.,1
but i cant log in to my previous acc just i left it a few weeks later.,1
the constant ads for the upgrade of this app keep bugging me though.,1
"if there was only one complaint, although it's not really that, it's just the word i'm using, it's that they just throw larger words and pronunciations at you without warning while you're still doing the simplest pronunciations.",1
sounds don't play since the last update.,1
i have to clear cache every time before every lesson.,1
it would be nice though if you could delete courses on your phone too instead of only on a computer.,1
the only complaint i have is that the lingots feel a little useless.,1
"my biggest complaint for japanese specifically is that there are lessons for hiragana, but we're kinda just thrown straight into katakana and kanji.",1
i should also mention that some of the phrases that we learn in japanese are extremely rarely used by native speakers (according to hellotalk friends).,1
the sound of course don't work properly.,1
all of them get mute during the tests!,1
it would be cool if it had a dark theme though.,1
"excellent way to learn a foundation for a language, but it has to be accompanied by immersion.",1
"im going to be honest right now this game is boring,i never really enjoyed it and couldnt really use it for long until i got bored but with the new update i love it!the update has new stories and they are always fun and entertaining and come with twists!now i love using this app and have no problem get a few stories every day!this makes me happy because i can have fun and learn a new language at the same time!5 stars love it!",1
only things i'd want would be a cool to section where you can like read through a bunch of different tips for each section instead of just one but overall i love it,1
"however, there is one small bug-the voice recognition questions are lenient to the point where while learning french someone said something in hindi in the background and it said that it was correct.",1
"however, i wish they had a few more languages and sometimes the audio doesn't work on some devices, despite turning it on.",1
"one thing bothers me, however... the ads.",1
make it easier to close ads please.,1
"my only complaint is that for spanish it can't understand me when i say ""uno, dos, tres"" even though i'm pronouncing it correctly - i've had my boyfriend whose first language is spanish try and it can't understand him either; it's just a glitch.",1
i wish there could be some back and forth dialogue.,1
only problem is when u r using it for free you see the ads interfering.,1
"the only problem i have, is that the competitive rankings are so large, it's a list cause to try.",1
first has 1500. so placing high is pretty difficult.,1
using the hearts to learn is a little disadvantaging when they run out but basically it's an impressive app.,1
i was a bit disappointed with the costumes for duo.,1
is there a way to show duo in their costumes when the app loads and when lessons load?,1
"your ""hey google"" ad is obnoxiously loud with the blaring trumpet.",1
i hate the ads after every lesson.,1
"i don't like that grammar isn't particularly taught, just suddenly introduced in a lesson for practice.",1
im not necessarily saying they should give books out just suggest easy to read books in the language the learner is desiring to learn.,1
would enjoy seeing more achievements or game like features in the future,1
"yet, one thing wrong is in the spanish lessons you learn to put in sometimes-unnecessary things.",1
"the only thing i need to say is there shouldn't be an option to remove notifications because since i removed notifications i lost inspiration to learn, but i'm starting again!",1
i only wish the quizzes were progress based.,1
it would be greater if the app does not stop sending notifications after a few days and maybe a little bit of change concerning the content of the notifocations would be greater as well.,1
"although its an awesome language learning app, but sometimes during in any particular section of language, it goes few steps ahead without the person who is learning having any clue for it, so i would just like to suggest that, it would be nice if you make ur sections easier and dont advance rapidly to another step without clearing up all the previous doubts",1
exceptional but though the letters are bit confusing in terms of cursive or book type.,1
"the only complaint is, apart from italy and rome, the use of mostly i american place names, which won't ever come up in classic or ecclesiastcal latin literature, which is what i at want to be able to read eventually.",1
would be great if there are more advanced levels of learning.,1
"it'll be better that can connect with friends live, such as live chats, audio calls.from that we can resolve our language matters with natives.",1
"but should show the translation of the words you are asked to recognise by sound, as is meaningless if you don't know what they are...and google doesn't or can't translate either, as that's not that good either!",1
currently am unable to hear the choices of sounds at the start of each lesson.,1
"the audio description comes through fine, but the four options are not spoken once pressed.",1
for beginners i strongly recommend that you click the lightbulb before starting a lesson test.,1
one of the favourite apps in my phone.,1
the grammar is a bit funny.,1
"the only ""bad point"" is the lack of explanation, so i would say that if you are really planning to learn, it's a side tool :)",1
my only area of regret with the system is the abuse of extra points.,1
the only improvement i could think of is to add the actual alphabet and what sounds each letter makes for that language.,1
one thing that i would like to say is that you should also make us do more oral practice.,1
"*there is a ""heart/error"" system in the app.",1
the only thing i would change in duolingo is background colour.,1
"however, you have to take it upon your self to broaden your vocabulary.",1
"currently using the free service, with the odd month premium here and there to give some support.",1
unfortunately i wouldn't be able to afford a whole year even though i think it's a wonderful resource that i hope continues to encourage people to learn.,1
"the mobile version has a limit of five hearts if you dont get premium, but if you have a computer i found that there is no hearts taken away if you make a mistake.",1
definitely should use headphones so you can get the inflections right.,1
)i'd like to see some culture thrown in to learn about.,1
")additional materials like literature or videos, that will be optional.",1
"the only thing i would change about it is the practice quizzes, they don't go over things you've already learned.",1
"the plus version is a little pricey, but definitely worth it!",1
its a very gd app for learning other language..but there should not be too much ad..,1
"first of all i have to thank you for this amazing app.it really works for me.but i have a small problem ,the voices don't work,so i miss a major part of it.can you fix it please?",1
"â˜†update, i'm in ruby and yet it's still showing im in sapphire?",1
"my only issue is that i wish it would let users type in japanese for said lessons (in the mobile app), but it's a small issue that doesn't diminish the rating i'm giving it",1
i would include a very breakdown lesson before reach new verb to show the differences.,1
"great app, but it has problem after the last update, at first it was good sound and pronunciation but now all gone i mean no sound!",1
no pronunciation!ðŸ˜¥ why?,1
"i'd still recommended lessons of some kind, as you can't always find a good explanation of why an answer is what it is.",1
though i would prefer more explanations why certain words are used in different contexts.,1
i really like this app but regarding the dualingo plus i'm a lil bit disappointed u guys already have ads but why u should make us pay to be able to learn offline too?,1
"i think there is be an option that allows users to connect with people, perhaps a chat option.",1
the only problem i have is that it's teaching me how to translate german into english more than it teaches me how to translate english into german but that could be because i just haven't gotten far enough.,1
i didn't update the app because i've heard it makes it a lot harder to learn with the heart system,1
would love to see gaidhlig and manx on here.,1
"significant repetition in the lessons is helpful for newbies, but intermediates will want to skip most early levels.",1
one feature would be great add-on is option to review some of the completed lessons as refresher.,1
the only thing is that after buying the duo skins and some other things you end up with a lot of lingots without any purpose.,1
maybe you guys could add more skins or some other things?,1
and live talking with other spanish people would be nice!,1
sometimes it is a little too rigid on the spelling of the new language but overall i am enjoying the app!,1
"the only thing that i want to mention is , not all the people from around the world can learn english by this app because there are some limited languages as the helping language for learning english not including farsi.thank again for this amusing app.",1
i experienced occasionally a glitch where it cancels your day streak.,1
i just wish there where more choices on regions of some languages!,1
"i'm learning italian, and i need to learn calabrian italian but theres only regular italian!",1
"the lessons are also challenging and knd of fun, but it would be nice if maybe there was a list of the vocabulary and maybe an explanation of how the grammar works somewhere.",1
"please add finnish,cantonese,northern sÃ¡mi and icelandic lesson for english speakers!",1
but what happen to the percentage bar that let us know how fluent in spanish or different language we were.,1
"i just wish it would stay at the same level each time i go on it, instead of not knowing where i was last time i used it.",1
i have lots of gems but nothing i can buy anymore.,1
please add more items in your shop.,1
if possible i would like to see group chat added.,1
i don't have a way to communicate on a daily to apply the languages i'm learning.,1
there are many complaints about duolingo spamming you when you break your streak.,1
sometimes the sentences are too long.,1
there is something need to be fixed about grammar of some languages.,1
"dosnt help with speaking, but learning to read, top notch",1
can there please be a dark mode option.,1
"i use duo everyday when i wake up and go to bed and it's a little rough on my eyes, to have that much white light.",1
"it wont teach me how to speak brittish-, could you change that please?",1
app is fantastic as if you run out of hearts to get more to try and move ahead you have to do a practice section so improving your skills further.,1
"this is a great app, although the hearts run out quickly and i think they take too long to refill :)",1
"in fact i am using it for almost 1 year, but something is missing, the filipino language, you should add that wonderful language, ang pilipino ay isang magandang wika, message from your filipino userðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­",1
"i would, however love to learn dovahzul (from the elder scrolls series).",1
"my only real frustration with this is if i'm having trouble with a certain lesson and need to practice it further, it hardly ever pulls up anything from that lesson in the practice section.",1
i wish there was some way to flag specific things so you can practice your troubled areas more.,1
"unfortunately there is no description to what level is reached , so i havent made up my mind whether to pay for a full subscription",1
monetization could be better.,1
please add persian.,1
just needs more items and accessories for duo in the item shop.,1
"good app for language learning.. though there r some bugs in some exercises, so i think u should add an option to tell about those bugs cause they stop the learning progress",1
"it's great, but you should get more than 5 hearts at a time.",1
"just don't know why i hear the speeches with very long delays, as of late.",1
"tho the heart is annoying, but i understand it is an encouragement.",1
the heart system is puts everything at a halt when you run out?,1
so i say the words in tbe language but don't know what they mean.,1
every time i try and load the page i get booted straight to the results page where i am told that i didn't achieve the pass mark.,1
if by some chance i manage to get to open the milestone section i get booted to the end results page and again am told that i didn't pass without being given the opportunity to complete the section.,1
loved it i am learning korean through the app but you need to know the basics of language to go on with it fortunately i am aware of the basics,1
"if it wasnt for the priceyness of the program i'd learn many languages but for now on a single mothers budget, i'll stick to the ones actually needed in my area.",1
i am a bit annoyed about the billing.,1
they straight up charged me 100$ for the year instead of the monthly rate every year.,1
takes a few to understand their lesson plan but it's set up extremely well.,1
though pictures hard to tell boy from girl something,1
"this is really good for learning languages, but if your dedicated and really want to learn, i would sugest doing other things along with this.",1
"like listen to music in the language you want to learn, podcasts, youtube vids, also duolingo.",1
"side note, i already had some knowledge of the language, so that made it a little easier for me.",1
"also, it'd be wonderful if such exercises were to accept any response offered using correct grammar and vocabulary, not just canned responses.",1
i recommend this app for dedicated adult learners.,1
it's a fantastic application but they have to tell us the meaning of the application and at the same time the application have to tell us what is the word mean in the sentence in what we're saying because we're saying it we does we don't exactly know what the picture is describing it's putting a man with a couple inside it's like a miniature can a cup or many people are drinking a cup i don't actually really understand it very well so like any time details to choose to language example first,1
it would be nice if you didn't have to pay to get the best experience but it is one of the best language learning apps i have had.,1
"please, fix the click button on top screen.",1
"it's a very good learning language apps, but boooooy... it's pretty expensive for me.",1
"at first i was a bit frustrated as you only had three tries at pronunciation, but, it really helps you learn things faster and focus.",1
"only issue i see is when the microphone is disabled to practice pronunciation, i would still like to be able to stay on the screen before it automatically jumps to the next.",1
"i've found one teeny flaw - and that is you need total silence for verbal exercise, if theres a siren in the distance or even if you have your tv on low, it struggles to differentiate.",1
"really have appreciated the app... although, the link to unsubscribe isn't allowing to cancel my subscription...",1
"what i found weird was the fact that it started with phrases directly and the writing is in greek, so if you have no idea regarding the greek alphabet, that's gonna be tricky.",1
"after multiple failed attempts, changing the voice recognition (still x), pronunciation difficulty (still x), it was my speed (correct!",1
"the word teaching, however, is a bit slow.",1
the app can be more effective by teaching more words instead of having the user go through some of the exercises over too frequently.,1
"the app wants you to repeat the syllables, the voice pronounces syllables as it is spoken but the app shows the word break down.",1
"voice pronounces ë¨¸ ê±° ìš”, app shows ë¨¹ ì–´ ìš”. the other issue is that it didn't teach the alphabet or pronunciation rules.",1
"the speaking part is sometimes a little buggy, but overall i'm happy with this app!",1
"there is only pictures and japanese words, no english (other then in menu) which i get since some words can't be translated into english but i wasn't used to this learning style so it took a few tries to get used to it, now i'm learning at a steady pace",1
"however, i would suggest a basic background in german if you have never stidied before.",1
"unfortunately the app doesn't allow you to complete milestones like you can on the desktop version, and some of the pictures are difficult to see on my phone screen.",1
maybe if the borders between the pictures were smaller it would help,1
the only issue i have had is background noise affects how well it years and rates your pronunciation.,1
"i'm learning japanese and it helps me with grammar, letters, and pronunciation.",1
i wish you guys will add some tips about oral practice especially for a1 exam.,1
"love it so far, although the prices in my opinion could be lowered",1
"it does require a good internet connection, but being able to sneakily keep learning while anywhere in the house with the babies has helped a lot!",1
and i was wondering if the games you have on the website will be added to the apps at any point?,1
"you are good at what you are doing, but if you added a option to type down the definition of that word in english or what ever language you speak (in general) and in that language you are ( also generally said) trying to learn and type down for moble, but other wise great job.",1
the only thing that would be better is if they added explanations along with the images in case you do not understand what you are saying based on the picture.,1
"the requirements for the pronunciation feel like i'm speaking quite mechanically, but you have to start somewhere.",1
so i am writing to let you know what language i want..the language i want to learn is bulgarian because my step dad is bulgarian and i want to learn his language so please put it on there so i can learn it ðŸ˜.,1
"i hate that i have to pay to be more advanced in it, i wish it were free",1
"learned quite a bit on the first lesson, i just wish i could get a translation so i know exactly what i'm saying.",1
i like it so far no issues but it would be great that show what are u saying instead of just images,1
would love for daily reminders built in.,1
great app on every bit but can you please add more languages,1
just having a hard trying to add on a second language.. i have my first one and went and purchased a second language for when i am done with the firat.. please help anyone!,1
"it sometimes crash, and difficult to loggin.",1
you have to pay a lot of money to get all lessons.,1
really good program tho i wish they would break down some word and their meaning,1
this app is really perfect unfortunately i cannot afford the subsription but i recommend this app fully wen i can afford it i will subscribe uwu,1
i love this app just cant afford the price to keep learning,1
shame it is not free.,1
stop telling me to rate your apps while i'm using them,1
very intuitive for all with different learning styles and can work at you're own pace.,2
"the gaming mechanic keeps you coming back for more, it's fun to compete on the leaderboards and in a couple of months you'll start to understand and maybe even basically speak another language!",2
making fun out of learning through gamification.,2
wonderful use of visual and audio clues.,2
does a great job keeping you engaged and interested and it really works.,2
each lesson has tips which are useful.,2
it is an easy way to learn a language & you move up or down in leagues pitted against each other.,2
learning is broke up in different categories and uses repetition and adding the old stuff into the new stuff to remember the words.,2
"and i also appreciate the app being free, along with all the languages and lessons!",2
and there aren't many ads either!,2
"it is engaging, fun and effective.",2
the repetition is very helpful for retaining new vocabulary and hearing the sentences is great for learning pronunciation.,2
it has ads but at a minimal but you don't have to watch them so its not bothering you.,2
"was expecting something that gave u the basics them u had to pay to go on, so happy this isn't the case!",2
it unlocks new material as u go on so i don't feel overwhelmed with words but a fast enough teaching pace to develop with.,2
i am really enjoying the gamified experience doulingo brings to learning a new language.,2
i appreciate that it has the listening and speaking parts so strongly integrated into the lessons.,2
i'm impressed that it can hear me speaking even in noisy situations.,2
"repetitive, which really helps you remember!",2
"you can set reminders so you don't forget as well as lose your spot on the leaderboard, where you can compete with the amount of xp you have with others.",2
"the app if free and there are minial ads, so dont worry about paying for anything.",2
"duolingo is a great app because there are so many languages to learn and you can learn more than one at a time, it also covers all the areas of the language.",2
"when learning the language you do everything - by this i mean you match up words, you pick the right words/phrases, you speak words and you also type after a few lessons.",2
i personally also really like the little mascot when he pops up and says something inspirational (this function is optional on settings) and the fact you have hearts.,2
the voice recordings are wonderfully clear with a speed up /slow down option.,2
"i'll get myself to a higher level before paying for further options, and appreciate being given the space to make this choice further along.",2
duolingo is awesome because it can be used in very small chunks.,2
"no long courses, or videos or other long time commitments.",2
you don't just read or listen or watch... you do all the forms of communication you encounter in the real world (including speaking to the app).,2
quick and friendly.,2
"even minor progress is noted in a fun, gamified way so your daily experience is a step forward.",2
the app reminds you every day to continue your streak and it runs well when you use it.,2
ads are non-intrusive and don't hinder the app itself at all.,2
"there isn't pressure for how much you do in a day, you set that and can learn at your own pace.",2
"extremely reliable, short infrequent ads, and highly rewarding.",2
"even the ads aren't too bad since there aren't that many and when i do get ads, they're only about 5 secs.",2
there is also a little bit of the competitiveness.,2
nothing like trying to stay on the top of the leaderboard and learning at the same time.,2
it is even helping me with conjugation and grammar a huge hurdle for me in learning spanish.,2
they have also added a stories section in the app so helpful!,2
i can learn at the pace i choose and not be bothered by the speed chosen by a teacher.,2
makes you genuinely interested in the language you are trying to learn.,2
"the repetitive nature of the way to learn from english to spanish and vice versa is very good, with the audio in spanish to learn the correct pronunciation invaluable.",2
"if you make a mistake in sentence structure, they show you how to correct it.",2
i also like this new story feature.,2
it gets u addicted and the leader board gives u motivation.,2
pretty intuitive.,2
"really helpful, and there's leaderboards to keep things competitive.",2
the ads are minimal and only serve the purpose of funding the app.,2
"duolingo is not a formal systematic, highly organized language course but because it is interactive it is satisfying and fun, like doing an eternal puzzle.",2
its great to be free.,2
"it's also fun, and feeds the reward centers throughout the learning process really well.",2
it has many different skills to learn and has handy motivational messages every so often.,2
self paced lessons are great and can do whenever convenient.,2
the q &a button for clarification from duo & other users is helpful.,2
recommend for all stages for learning,2
but it's free with a few ads that aren't bothersome so all's good.,2
"its fun, interactive it identifies weak points and helps you strengthen them... i've got my daughter on it to help her with her spanish i honestly couldn't recommend it more!",2
yes there are ads but they're not intrusive and you can skip easily... i'm tempted to subscribe its just that good,2
"great app, that makes learning languages fun and easy.",2
the app actually is very fun and rewarding!,2
very consistent and actually very easy to work with.,2
also offers a massive range of languages including latin and klingon!,2
so fun and easy to learn.,2
"it really helps me with school and is not inappropriate at all, me and my parents really recommend this app for school and other occasions.",2
lessons are short or as long as you like and broken into small chunks so you are not overwhelmed.,2
best part is its free with little actual interuption or heavy pushing you on their premium service.,2
there are ads but that's completely fine considering the experience they provide.,2
"great app, free to use but you only get a limited amount of use per day but you can upgrade to unlimited for a small monthly fee, which is well worth the cost as you won't want to put it down.",2
it makes learning fun!,2
and this company ensures that education is available to all with its free version!,2
easy to use.,2
never boring and it is free .my spanish is coming on great i am 59 and love the app.,2
recommended for all ages and abilities,2
it has made learning a different language easy and motivational.,2
the way the lessons are set up really help you to retain the information.,2
i like the way it shows the hiragana for the word.,2
this app gives great repetitive words that help you memorize them.,2
in ways it is better than studying in a class because of the repetition and the way they have you go over what you have been taught.,2
easy to set up and get started.,2
"fun, game-like learning structure.",2
unintrusive ads.,2
would recommend to language learners of any age.,2
practicing with a lot of repetition is really helping.,2
"it makes you work on vocabulary and grammar, listening, reading.",2
and it s fun.,2
"easy, informative, fun and free.",2
added detail about grammar and info such as how to ask for tap water vs sparking water when traveling is a great addition.,2
this is a very interactive app.,2
with lots of languages to learn.,2
"you get to speak, translate english to the language of choice learning and vise versa.",2
i'm actually retaining the language and it's not boring so maintaining the lessons isn't a drag.,2
learn as fast or slow as you need.,2
absolutely free and the ads aren't annoying at all.,2
i also like that i can listen to their podcasts on spotify to practice spanish on my drive to work.,2
they give you a lot of ways to help you learn the language at your own pace and things like leaderboards and streaks to keep you interested and learning.,2
"excellent straightforward learning, broken down into easy steps and short lessons so you can do as little or as much as you like.",2
it is also amazing because if you don't get a question it will keep coming back until you get it.,2
"i love everything you get from duo, the content is thorough and i like how it's structured, a great and fun support when learning a language.",2
"i love the ease of use, the repetition doesn't seem boring.",2
"the lessons are just long enough that you actually learn, but not so long that you get bored!",2
all round excellent experience- just wish they had a finnish course..,2
"nice friendly interface, and very encouraging and easy to use every day",2
really user friendly.,2
easy to get in 5 -15 minutes a day,2
"you earn rewards and are modivated to return to continue your daily ""streaks"".",2
this fun atmosphere in the app keeps me coming back.,2
it takes a lot of repetitions but that is the best way to remember new words.,2
easy pace.,2
can increase pace if wanted.,2
really easy to use and it feels more like a game rather than lessons.,2
fun way to learn a new language.,2
lots of repetition really helps solidify the learning of words.,2
they make it fun and game like so for me it's an excellent learning tool.,2
"i mean come on, they even have klingon!",2
it is the best one i have found and i love the way the league makes you want to learn more to get xp.,2
"the lessons are quite fun, and don't feel like just a big chore.",2
the podcast is great as well,2
(and the ads are actually interesting),2
really easy too navigate and use.,2
has a wonderful way of teaching so that you can learn through different methods and senses.,2
ads are almost nonexistent and are all nondisruptive.,2
i especially love the tips.,2
learning a languages has never been that much fun.. learning through answering questions like a game is really an effective methodology..,2
"this app makes learning languages easy and fun.it is also easy and convenient to pick up and use, doesn't take up much space on your device and encourages you to use it every day.",2
"it,'s free and beter then what i expected.",2
"i recommend this app to everyone, and even young children can use this.",2
using this app is very easy and the exercises are great to improve language skills.,2
it gives enfasis on repeating what we are learnig and that is very good to fix it in memory.,2
makes learning into a game and less of a chore.,2
"duolingo is super addicting, and fun to use.",2
"first, the program structure allows for several repetitions of a new material and that helps in memorizing.",2
the second aspect is a concept of leagues where one can view a progress and compare that progress with others in the same league.,2
it also gives you reminders so you don't forget.,2
the practice sections are really helpful to review your learning.,2
the discussions explain the why if you get it wrong so you can make sense of the irregulars.,2
"duolingo is a very intuitive, user friendly and fun to use.",2
all fall short when compared to that unique fun and game experience it brings to the table.,2
"good number of languages available, for now i have been going for german, spanish and chinese.",2
best of all it's free.,2
"they now have stories to practice reading, it's good for building vocabulary, the system they have makes it fun.",2
the progress report gives just enough incentive to make sure i log in every day to complete a couple lessons.,2
"it's really effective and effecient, the app takes time to make sure you grasp concepts,spelling , pronunciation and accent of whatever language you decide to learn.",2
easy to use for every age range.,2
"but i just did my first story today, and absolutely loved it.",2
easy to play and retain what you learn in a natural and interactive format.,2
fun and easy to use.,2
its a great app and i love that its free and comes with a listen along podcast (at least for french and spanish language) one thing that would be helpful if provided by the creators would be a list of reading material appropriate for the level of learning the user is at.,2
its simple to wander through and very flexible.,2
it's also fun to interact with because of it's platforms.,2
"speaking, writing, interpreting from english to spanish or spanish to english, it all makes learning fun and quick and the app gives us goals to set as well so it's like having a personal tutor at the tip of my fingers!",2
i'm so glad that japanese is added i've been wanting to learn that language for a long time.,2
the ranking system gives the competitive feel and keeps the interest going.,2
up: i like the new update where i can now see my 'cracked eggs'.,2
excellent usability.,2
"the exercises, scores and rewards are strategic and motivating.",2
the only app that i've actually managed to use daily.,2
it's super easy to get into and is actually quite fun to learn with this app.,2
"with the daily reminders and the customizable daily goals, it is super easy to keep going.",2
"also, with the addition of stories in the spanish lessons i've been learning much quicker!",2
"you can learn key phrases, practice speaking them, listen to podcasts, the features are pretty deep for a learning app.",2
"it is a very straightforward language learn app and doesn't seek to completely ""gamify"" the experience but it still manages to keep my interest and motivate me to keep learning, practicing, and progressing.",2
plus i feel oddly encouraged when the little owl pops out and says nice things.,2
it is great using duolingo on android and computer and it can help you learn a language free no matter you are a beginner or not.,2
there are many languages to learn and i really suggest clicking on tips to learn deeper.,2
"fantastic way to learn another language i have had a really hard time in other classes and programs learning spanish, but this is actually enjoyable and game like that it makes it easy to learn, it's also really repetitive to where the farther you get in you feel like you naturally know the words, and it's legitimately free where you're not trapped into not exceeding without upgrading.",2
excellent interface.,2
well paced lessons.,2
steady pace which suits me.,2
clever use of learned words.,2
the graphics and voices are pleasant.,2
there are just enough game-like features to motivate extra study.,2
"for example, errors cost â¤ï¸; i love that you can earn extra â¤ï¸s by practicing.",2
"watching video ads is optional, and earns gems you can spend in the game.",2
this is a delightful app that builds up my language skills in a fun way.,2
"today i discovered the story section on the website, which is lots of fun now that i've learned quite a bit of vocab.",2
"play with a benefit, learn in an easy, fun way.",2
"like that it provides exercise with different language skills, including not only vocab exercise, but also listening and speaking practice.",2
like that it even has speaking practice with a voice detection function to see if the pronunciations are correct.,2
as addictive as a game.,2
really like the restore function for completed lessons to ensure you don't leave behind previously learned content.,2
this app has been great at motivating me to learn a new language as well as refresh me on languages i've learned a little.,2
the lightbulb takes you to a page that explains the lesson.,2
it not got a lot of ads and is a fun way of learning.,2
great for daily use.,2
overall it's still a more fun method of learning than spanish 1 in school or random learn spanish cd's.,2
"app is fully free, there are ads to support the app, but it's not intrusive or anything.",2
"firstly, it's not just french/german/spanish/italian courses - many mire languages, some quite obscure.",2
the lessons are simple and friendly even for absolute beginners for any language it offers.,2
"the daily reminders, subtle spirit of competition evoked from the leaderbaord and the goals and checkpoints all do a great job of helping me learn.",2
"from what i've used so far its excellent, repetitive so that you can memorize the words well.",2
"i haven't used podcasts yet, but the stories help.",2
"it doesn't start off teaching you the alphabet and verb tenses, but teaches you how to speak similarly to how you would teach a child.",2
and the authentic pronunciations buy authentic speakers enhances the ability to learn,2
plus it's free and a fun way to learn.,2
this app is great for children and adults alike.,2
the best part is that the app is regularly updated.,2
i've picked up more french in a couple of lessons than i ever thought 9 possiblethe tips before each lesson are very good and i'm actually enjoying learning a language.,2

edit after a month of use: i like it more than rosetta stone i feel like you get to learn new words slowly and they give you time to learn the new word.,2

"the easy build of vocabulary and the mix of speaking, writing and listening are effective.",2
"excellent app with a good range of motivational twists to keep you practising...and if you are ever tempted to whinge, remember it is still free",2
i love this program so much because not only does it teach you how to read and say the words but emphasizes on pronunciation as well.,2
adding pictures to the words for association is absolutely the top layer of sprinkles one needs to learn effectively.,2

this app makes you think and build your learning experience your own way by throwing right into experiencing the language.,2
"the app tells you what words mean using pictures, and challenges you to break down the sentences yourself.",2
"at first it seemed way too challenging, but i was suprised when they asked me to describe a picture for the first time and i said a full sentence of japanese on my own!",2
really instills the feeling of accomplishment.,2
"i'm glad they sync well, though, so i can use either and stay caught up.",2
closest thing to a classroom as i can get.,2
the first lesson pushed me to figure out the meaning of the words for myself and encouraged me to try speaking them as well.,2
"i've tried duolingo, which is free, but rosetta stone tests your pronunciation much more accurately, and introduces new words by building on existing phrases that you've learned, which is a much more realistic and immersive way of learning than learning individual words in isolation of phrases.",2
"for learning vocabulary in an intuitive way, rosetta stone is much better than other programs.",2
"absolutely amazing and entertaining, a must have for any wanting to learn a new language quickly and enjoyably",2
"it tests you on the same thing multiple times to make sure you can say it, hear it, and read it.",2

great for words and learning to pronounce them,2
"so intuitive, its freaky that i understand it, almost without trying.",2
the application makes sure you are pronouncing the the words correctly.,2
very interactive.,2
very easy to navigate and learning is quick with associations.,2
"great way to learn and understand language using pictures, sounded out audio, and even recording your voice letting you nail that pronunciation!",2
it is invaluable for someone learning a language without a teacher as it subtly teaches the languages rules and teaches correct pronunciation of difficult words.,2
"no english translation, instead its all pictures and the spanish words.",2
i really like the voice interaction.,2
very good speech recognition,2
this is a fun interactive immediately satisfying confidence building program so far,2
"i like this app, easily for leaning by pictures",2
useful app with lots of repetition,2
and i love that i get prompts reminding me to study.,2
"i love rosetta stone so much, you should get it amazing graphics and amazing learning courses !",2
the facility to listen and repeat in french is extremely useful.,2
getting into it repitition helps good free app,2
easy to navigate,2
i really like the use of photos and not translations.,2
"i think this is really good, and for all the people wanting to learn for free this is good as you don't need to buy anything to use the basics.",2
it also doesn't waste as much time on hello goodbye and starts including basic grammar very early on,2
it's a great tool that allows you to learn at your own pace wherever you may be.,2
"it's fairly easy to use, and the lesson plans come with set time frames that are typically short and sweet.",2
it.s nice that it also has pictures that really help visually as well which really helps with the visua memory.,2
"dont worry if you dont know what a phrase means, just hold down on the phrase or picture, and press see translation, it's as easy as that.",2
there are different categories that you can choose from for what kinds of words/phrases you want to learn.,2
that way i can envision it in my head instead of having to translate it over first,2
"you attach sounds with images and ideas, not to english words.",2
it tests your pronunciation.,2
absolutely love the speech and communication breakdown technology and visual association!,2
each lesson is broken down to help improve pronunciation and build confidence speaking and perfecting tone and patience.,2
"the system is really effective because it allows your mind to associate words with images, not their english translations.",2
"this prevents you from getting caught up trying to think of what you want to say in english and translating it, and instead allowing you to think of the language directly",2
was shocked just how well the phone app worked compared to my other devices.,2
"carefully built up learning program, addressing different components (vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation); plenty of possibilities to practice; direct feedback during exercises; and a good balance between doable and challenging.",2
"they even have stories to read, all without being on the premium version!",2
one of the best app for learning german especially for one without any previous knowledge (a1).,2
i like how it uses pictures without your native language so you arent constantly translating back and forth.,2
i love being able to learn at my pace on my phone!,2
i'm a language teacher and i really approve of the concept of full immersion.,2
the app runs cleanly and is almost more user friendly than the program itself.,2
emphasis on picture learning and repetition makes it easy and fun.,2
"only a few lessons in, and i'm thinking my answers in spanish, instead of searching for english translations in my head.",2
the method used is very efficient in retaining new information.,2
"i'm a visual learner so using the pictures really help me, and after only 30 minutes i knew some words in korean!ðŸ˜„",2
great customer service from not only rosetta stone but from google representatives as well.,2
i like the fact that i can pick up where i left off from home.,2
i like having the images along with the vocabulary.,2
the way the app listens to your pronunciation is helpful as well.,2
i believe that the dynamics of having both a visual and audio aid on top of the accent assistance makes thus a great learning tool.,2
uses only the language that you are learning so you think in that language rather than translating in your head.,2
great for kids too!,2
similar to a puzzle.,2
this make it really easy to learn a language and you go up in steps so it builds on what the last lesson was about making it easier to retain each days lesson.,2
"i just completed section 1. the pictures help, there's pronunciation assistance, and it was easy to follow.",2
"great interface, easy to learn with the immersion teaching, i can tell i'll be fluent in spanish in a few months",2
"you think you don't understand a word, but in a couple of minutes, you're using it in sentences as if you've always known it.",2
total immersion is awesome this is an excellent way to learn a language keep up the good work!,2
constantly progressing but lots of opportunities to review what has already been learned,2
i love love love this app â¤ï¸ its allowing me to learn easily not only is it auditary learning but interactive and visual as well which for someone who has aspergers amoung other disorders is so relieving.,2
"this is so fun & easy, if i get less than a 100% on a lesson it tells me to try for a 100%ðŸ˜… or i could go to the next lesson oh my goodness.... all ages can use it if able to .",2
easy to use with a smart phone and very convenient for when i have a few moments to spair or an hour.,2
