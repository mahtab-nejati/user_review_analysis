perfect pp for learning new languages....although its not with languages that you need to advance in..... i recommend it to everyone i know ) bow its one of the best free apes i know...even when or lives are out (they are 5) you can get more lives by practicing which is even better !,0
known as the elite language learning program for a reason ,0
i know how to order food in german however this program helps me learn the details with the german language.,0
have to guess the vocabulary once in a while but perhaps it was deliberate to keep users attention.,0
"if you give it serious time (not 5 minutes a day like they advertise, but more like an hour or two daily), this learning method actually works well to get you started with a language.",0
"amazing learning tool for those who want to set a foundation for learning a language, me personally chose russian and i feel like i am learning a good amount, you just need to dedicate time and effort, i also recommend tiny cards and then follow the language you're learning to help practice and perfect the language of your choice.",0
hopefully i will have russian killed in eventually.,0
just need to put in the work.,0
"overall, great free pp and i love domingo!!",0
!,0
a wonderful and revolutionary pp.,0
wonderful to use before to study up for trip abroad.,0
"where's the pp that makes learning history, path, or other subjects fun?!",0
thank you for your service and helping those who commit to continuous learning and growth.,0
an excellent language pp.,0
fun to use.,0
"lessons depend on the category chosen & can be phrases in your home language & the language you are learning, write what you have heard, speak the phrase or word, enter missing words, vocabulary.",0
see which languages others are learning.,0
"complete as little or more daily or less frequently, easy to pick up again.",0
"but for a free pp, that genuinely reaches you the language and how to spell and pronounce things correctly.",0
it is great.,0
there really are no shortcuts and you have to stick with it.,0
if you want to learn a language you can.,0
this pp is great and makes it easy to get into your routine.,0
just beware of the owl if you leave your modifications on.,0
he will remind you.,0
i have been using the pp for a week and so far is good.,0
i am learning spanish and german and slowly starting italian.,0
"with many option, it's easy to learn a new language at your own pace.",0
this pp is very fun and educational.,0
it makes learning a new language easy and fun!,0
i would give you 100 stars if i could.,0
i really appreciate this pp.,0
"well, it is not a bad application... i mean, it is too similar to a game but if you pay attention and follow the advice the pp itself gives (read each lesson out loud and write the new vocabulary you learn after practicing), then you will probably get the basic knowledge such as sounds and simple vocabulary.",0
"so, it is recommended to beginners but you can't stop here.",0
i would highly recommend this as a method of learning a second language.,0
i have learnt more grammar in a very short period than i have with other language learning software.,0
love domingo and my portuguese is getting so much better!,0
"other than that, this pp is absolutely great!",0
the two languages are so similar and it would be much easier to learn being italian my first language!),0
very nice pp.,0
there are a lot of things that might be useful if you are learning new language.,0
"it is easy, funny and useful.",0
highly recommended this pp when you are learning either at home or outside.,0
this surely is the best free language learning pp available.,0
it makes learning real easy and fun.,0
plus it keeps you motivate and its just amazing.,0
you can set the bar low but when you start you almost dont want to quit.,0
so in my opinion its definitely worth a try!,0
"domingo is a great pp for learning, absolute 5 stars, its great, i love it, the lessons are very intriguing and i love, just love the cut little animation on the lessons, when i'm doing my japanese lessons, i always loved the lessons little pictures, but those little animation are perfect!",0
yes.,0
"it's really good and allows a varied method of teaching , i love the competition with up and story mode.",0
so helpful for learning a language.,0
best pp for this i've found.,0
a very enjoyable pp.,0

this pp is very helpful and i feel that i can become client in the language i am learning using this pp and this pp alone.,0
i absolutely love it!,0
it would help with trying to remember words without having to be in lessons.,0
"other than that, i absolutely love the pp.",0
it has helped me so much!,0
i can get by in french and am using domingo to get up to date.,0
"between the pp and the webster, you've got yourself a perfectly useful way to learn languages any time and just about anywhere.",0
and free?!,0
yes!!!,0
no catches.,0
you can bang out a few good lessons while on the toilet... or waiting for the bus... or in any short moment that you get throughout the day.,0
the key is to stick with it and let it's game-style structure show you the way.,0
i was impressed in how the pp manages to integrate so many methods and functions for becoming comfortable with a foreign language.,0
maybe in the future?,0
"thank you to the developer for a great, free tool!",0
"the pp lets you get into a new language rather random, but in a great speed.",0
well done!,0
"great pp in grain mode, even better when you pay :)",0
amazing.,0
"i'm using the pp to learn japanese from english currently, and although it's definitely suited for teaching spanish, french, and german, it's still the best way to learn japanese that i've found that actually gives you the whole language for free as well as reaches you both how to speak the language and how to read it.",0
most japanese learning apes i've used only do one or the other.,0
i highly recommend this pp.,0
it's simple a simple enough pp.,0
"i'm not far into the pp yet, but it seems good so far!",0
some things can be frustration but that's more due to the lessons than the pp itself.,0
"if you enjoy domingo, this pp is for you",0
this pp helps me so much!,0
i've made so much progress over the last 2 years and i love everything about it!,0
thank so much for creating domingo!!!,0

my girls all have the pp and we are learning as a family.,0
"we are learning a new language for fun, and fun is what we are getting out of this learning pp.",0
thanks,0
free and really works!,0
i started taking spanish in the rd grade and all through school and struggled greatly barely passing or worse and could never retain anything i learned.,0
i dont know how this pp works but suddenly i am remembering words and am able to use them and have real conversations in spanish.,0
i'm learning a lot from this pp.,0
like when i translate something or pick the correct translated word.,0
be careful of types!,0
domingo is helpful in learning a new language.,0

i feel like this is one of the best self study apes.,0
this has helped me learn some languages in an attention grafting way,0
extremely simple and practical.,0
"i find myself doing a little practice every day effortlessly, even with multiple languages added.",0
very useful for maintaining and developing competence in my second languages.,0
"domingo is a ""lucky"" way to learn a language: it requires you to largely work out the rules of the target language yourself, but that is exactly what babies and tollers do.",0
it is just one tool among the many which you need to use to learn a new language.,0
it has flaws but don't treat the course seriously.,0
serious studies are elsewhere.,0

"download it know if u want to speak like a pro.learn with do the owl and speak like a legend or be there and read boring books about languages which are 200pg long.dealing's motor should be ''learn today, speak tomorrow.''",0

fastforward to finding domingo: now this is an pp i can get into!,0
the format feels like a real game and not a lesson.,0
i really have a chance to improve now!,0

"the league system also helps, as it encourages you to do more lessons.",0
"you can get a new skin for do with them, and occasionally you can buy extra lessons with them, but other than that, they don't feel very important or useful.",0

so far this pp is the best resource i have had for learning languages.,0
i love this pp.,0
i'm currently studying japanese.,0

so easy and fun.,0
very good pp.,0
this is absolutely amazing.,0
"i wanted to learn japanese, just to add some fun into my life, and it's working perfectly!",0
thank you for it being free!,0
"this is probably a common complaint, but i usually hit the stop as with super do on accident.",0
thank you!,0
i love the pp.,0
an absolutely phenomena educational application.,0
"while many sites and courses build their content on technical levels, with everything being taught as machine-like and algorithmic, domingo is a breath of fresh air that truly attempts to imbibe fleecy in its users.",0
"it's the difference between translating ""je suis content(e)"" to ""i am happy"" and understanding ""je suis content(e)"" as ""je suis content"".",0
"to any one searching for an aid to learning language, with ample practice, do is the way.",0

it's free and the material is fantastically done to help you learn fast and remember.,0
it has a huge list of languages.,0
there is one ad at the end of each lesson.,0
so they dont bug you every second.,0
definitely worth more than 5 stars.,0

"even when i stopped for over a year, i hadn't forgotten what i learned.",0
"domingo uses the same method as the very expensive roseola stone computer software (immersion), and they do it for free.",0
absolutely 5 stars.,0
i have never got such an experience from a language learning application before.,0
i have been using it for something like over a week and overall i still am amazed at how it makes me want to learn new things each day sometimes multiple times a day.,0
"an easy and productive way to learn, practice and experience languages.",0
i really like the fact that domingo in general has improved.,0
"(keeping streaks, setting your daily challenge) overall, i find it a good tool to help learn a language, not entirely sure whether it can teach the language completely but at the very least, it is a very good stepping stool.",0
amazing pp that helps learn languages for free.,0
"i can't believe this pp, this is free(like literally), very very easy to go with and this is some high quality stuff..",0
the fattest and easiest way to learn a new language!,0
"five days into the week, i have 150 or so up.",0
i'm in with.,0
second and third sit at about 350 up.,0
even placing high enough to advance to the fourth bracket is pretty involved.,0
"i expected the character to be wearing it all the time through the pp, not just when it peeped in during lessons.",0
otherwise i feel it was a waste of gems to purchase them.,0
p.s.,0
please find a way to turn down the volume on it.,0
"i have 70000+up in spanish, and 4000+ in french, yet i hated this pp more that i liked it.",0
"just my fondness for languages, and it being free (i'm frugal) kept bringing me back.",0
loved it!,0
i think i can endure the as now.,0
good work team!,0
much more effective than using a physical language book.,0
"really nice pp, very advanced learning system.",0
i love this pp for a few reasons.,0
love it!,0
this webster helped me keep an a in my language classes end after i finish my glasses i was able to get even better at the same witches and even learn more.,0
i would definitely recommend this to any students and people who just simply want to learn another language.,0
this pp is amazing.,0
"it helps cream the words in my mind, and even gives pro tips!",0
"for example: ""to so juan.""",0
"the 'to' is not needed, since 'so' already means 'i am'.",0
"i'm just assuming that you might say 'to so' to be more formal, maybe?",0
that's what i don't know.,0
"otherwise, 5 stars!",0
the way domingo reaches is very good and shows you many sentence examples that will help you make your own in your language of choice.,0
"although there are times that it feels grind, but that's how you actually learn the language and be able to speak and write it.",0
"i think the office feature is worth purchasing, too.",0

it's surprisingly simple to use with its neat design and layout unlike many apes.,0

i love this pp!,0
it helped me learn spanish.,0
my friend sophia starting learning danish as well on this pp!,0
i need to give this pp more than 5 stars!,0
of˜ƒ,0
lots of mobile games have rewards for logging in daily and still that doesn't motivate me to do so nearly as much as this pp does.,0
i'm currently on a 100 day streak and have used it every day =d.,0
edit 1: still going strong.,0
excellent pp!,0
it's been incredibly helpful.,0
"and as a lesion, it was wonderful to see a story involving two women on their honeymoon!",0
thanks so much do team!,0
Â¡much gusto!,0
domingo is a way of learning languages and doing so in the go.,0
but it's more than reading the words.,0
"therefore, if you want to brush up on a new language or refresh after some time away from speaking that language, domingo is the best pp to date...a modern day roseola stone for the digital age.",0
i love this pp.,0
it's very easy to build up skill on any language through the apes as it guide you systematic way .,0
"it's nice pp to start learning a foreign language...easy , interactive and engaging",0
great way of learning languages!!,0
definitely recommend it!,0
!,0
"it helps you listen, speak, read and write and when you need more real communications, you can join events at your neighborhood.",0

great experience and a fun way to learn.,0

"i stated from nothing and i'm learning very quickly, enjoying it all along.",0
i've been learning for nearly two months now and still enjoying it a lot.,0
this pp is by far one of the best things i've ever download.,0
"not only has do convinced me to stop wasting time watching brain-dead couture video, i can now actually speak in a different language!",0
"also the whole stories feature is great as it gives a fairly good stimulation of how conversations are held, which in turn is vital for becoming proficient in a language.",0
fun and easy to use.,0
very practical for language learning.,0
domingo is the best free language learning pp i've used.,0
it's efficient for what it is and is still growing as they update it.,0
i'm actually learning.,0
thoroughly enjoy!,0
a very smart pp.,0
i like the pp they make it easy and fun to learn and they really work with you in trying to progress.,0
absolutely amazing!,0
i love this pp.,0
it makes learning languages fun and effective.,0
lots of fun and learning a new skill.,0
really great.,0
domingo is a really good pp.,0
it was recommended by one of my friend.,0
easy to use and understand the system as well.,0
such a great pp.,0
makes learning fun n and unapproachable!,0
i'm hooked :),0
pretty good pp.,0
"so, you don't improve on the wee words!!",0
"otherwise, am enjoying and am learning.",0
great pp.,0
although i am just at the beginning stages of learning it is fun and information,0
otherwise great.,0
i'm also learning new ways to say things in languages i was already familiar with.,0
most seem to miss that aspect of domingo and get upset when they are immediately asked about words and phrases they don't know.,0
"i love this pp i am learning french, spanish and welsh and i never dreamed of learning any language.",0
if you want feedback i would add little games in between to help you and to know what you struggle with.,0

great way to learn or refresh a language.,0
it is super easy to use the free version.,0
also to practice to re up your health.,0
i am practicing ukrainian.,0
i have a friend who first language is ukraine.,0
he says it is good.,0
so far it is a good pp.,0
i will update my rating after further use.,0
i am rate 21 in banking so far.,0
:),0
i've been hooked on this for a few days now.,0
"i've lived in china for a few years, mingled in japanese in college, and had a couple of awesome russian roommates.",0
this pp is great for touching up on languages i haven't spoken in a while and has been teaching me russian at a surprising pace (cyrillic is no joke).,0
not a big deal.,0
"oh, and it's 100% free",0
solid start in domingo.,0
"started with spanish, to which i did have some previous experience learning.",0
though it never really took back then.,0
it seems to be taking now.,0
"not sure yet if that's because of the previous base and the ten thousandth time is the charm for me, or if these short, repetition, simple lessons really help build an understanding.",0
i'm willing to give domingo the credit!,0
the pp is also good and very well done.,0
"i've a fair bit of language learning experience, and domingo is very good indeed.",0
"i've always laughed at courses with almost-nonsensical sentences (eg, ""the blue mouse is in the trap""), but such tests make you think about *every* word, and not just guess by context.",0
"i do some every day, and am nearly 8 months in the hungarian course, and i'm loving it.",0
"thanks, domingo owl, you're the best.",0
"i only got this a few days ago but so far it's been engaging, encouraging and overall pleasantly education.",0
loved it.. easy to learn and systematic approach to build fundamentals.,0
it takes time to learn and remember the language so i've learnt that you need to be patient with the pp as you won't learn it in 2 weeks but it could be months the more you use it.,0
the course is simple to follow and the forum allows for queried to be answered.,0
there are some who compound more points than time allows and this stops target being achieved.,0
"but, this course is still the best for learning a language and not just basic conversational ability.",0
i have recommended domingo and there is now a group of six of us studying together.,0
"this is a great pp, and so far, i've been learning russian and progressing very well.",0
it would really help if that was added.,0
otherwise an amazing pp!,0
"i've always wanted to learn a foreign language, but i thought it would be difficult.",0
this pp teachers in such a way that keeps you interested.,0
great language learning pp!,0
this pp is amazing.,0
"if you are a beginner and don't know a language, domingo is the best pp for you.",0
it will help you learn a language very efficiently.,0

i was going to give 4 stars but realized it's not the program...it's me.,0
likes!,0
"i haven't utilized the pp to its fullest, but what i've used so far has been good.",0
i like that it's pass/fail with pronunciation because that's where i struggle the most.,0
i've ignored most of them (hata) but it does plant the seed and today i started lessons again.,0
hopefully will stick with it :-/,0
well done!!!,0
great pp,0
can you guns give me probably some discount please?,0
good to improve language,0

"the pp is great, everything here has the fantastic sense of helping people improving their english skill... i mean it's really good!",0
just try it,0
"it was was easy to learn and fun, i enjoyed it!",0
its roseola stone.,0
the number one language learning program in the world.,0
of course deserves 5 stars.,0
takes time to learn and i like the way it goes through the steps.,0
it is challenging but when i can't complete a task there are option to open 'windows' with translations (for instance) for further guidance.,0
i feel i've learnt so much in just one hour!,0
great!,0
just keep practicing!,0
best pp in learning any languages!,0
very easy to follow!,0
great addition to my day.,0
easy and fun to use.,0
very easy.. highly recommended,0
wonderful having so much fun,0
it's a great tool to practice stuff that you already know and to learn some new stuff,0
this pp reaches basis without telling you exactly what to say and you pretending to memories.,0
"even after a few days of not doing it, i still can remember what i learned previously because of the unique way it is taught.",0
easy to learn with this pp.,0
"even if i can't do that particular exercise right then, i shouldn't be hurried past.",0
"other than that, excellent pp!",0
i understand some spanish already.,0
"the pp doesn't provide traditional methods taught in school; the pp makes you think about what you are saying with several visual examples, and also helps measure your understanding and pronunciation with each example.",0
"i use it daily to help brush up on my comprehension and application of spanish, and i recommend this pp for anyone looking to learn a second language.",0
i love this pp and want to share it with my son,0
update after a 3 months of use: this is the best pp i've ever come across for learning a different language.,0
it's immersion and intuition and i will most certainly be continuing with my subscription.,0
that's just nitpicking though.,0
10-Act,0
very well-designed.,0
roseola stone makes it easier to progress then any other program i have seen.,0
well this is fun!,0
but of course we need to buy it to get better access.,0
good thing i already know some greek and everything doesn't seem that overwhelming of˜‰ looking forward to explore more,0
"j'accuse the pp, mais it's right.",0
ll.,0
"i have my and language proficient in french, but for certain words it kept x'ing me.",0
my speech was just too elongated).,0
"i *wish* the pp had given clues, because i was getting' real t.o.",0
'ed at the pp.,0
"however, for not being a live human, this root does remarkable well and my confidence in the grammar's improving too!",0
"this pp is great for learning a language, fast.",0
"i would highly recommend this pp to a friend, or family.",0
you can learn so many words in such a small amount of time.,0
thanks roseola stone for helping me to learn italian everyday.,0
very effective in teaching pronunciation.,0
there are just two flaws.,0
really good for getting you speaking the language and recognizing characters.,0
core lessons go a little fast but smaller specific lessons let you practice things like pronunciation of the syllables.,0
i like that it tells you of you are pronouncing something wrong.,0
"if my opinion changes with further use, i'll update this rating.",0
really great when haired with other learning programs/books/material.,0
the audit is great to listen to in the car on the way to work for extra listening comprehension work!,0
awesome learning tool,0
great pp.,0
"haven't gotten very far into it yet, but i'm already learning so much.",0
"instead of learning to translate it over to my first language which is english, i learned to associate the language that i'm learning with pictures.",0
great way to sharpen skill.,0
outstanding method of learning,0
was not so hard a little issue with my pronunciation,0
"if you don't mind paying, this a has the best learning outside of complete immersion.",0
"the written word is not for beginners, though.",0
"you may need another a to learn angel letters, chinese or japanese.",0
such neat educational technology development that is organized and super effective in producing results!,0
easy to use and fun,0
i usually use the lawton version because i think this method gets more effective by seeing larger picture and in a quiet room.,0
"however, for the use of the audit clips on the way, the pp version is useful.",0
thanks for the steady updated.,0
i really enjoyed learning japanese here.,0
it's more like a project based learning method than normal methods learning from recognizing the alphabet.,0
i think it will be more efficient for one to master a language.,0
good luck.,0
absolutely incredible.,0
you will surprise yourself with how fast and quick you will learn the basis of the language.,0
spanish in my case.,0
the structure of the learning process is done in a unique way.,0
you will cruise fearlessly throughout the learning units.,0
"in short, the best of them all!",0
i've used most of all the other apes but none of them can be compared to even the half of roseola stone.,0
"good , but only one lesson.",0
"i have utilized several, at least 5 different methods to learn hebrew, including those with personal teacher interaction -- as well as having researches over a dozen other methods before purchasing; yet, i have found roseola stone incredibly far more effective than any other method -- also, though i've formally studied both spanish & russian, hebrew is not an easy language for an american to learn, i have been surprised at how well through roseola stone that in a short time i've already...",0
i studied german in the past and was able to use up to unit 9 in review.,0
for me this is a great resource.,0
"the noun declaration, propositions, sentence structures and verb congregations can be confusing to a novice.",0
great if you want an easy way to learn the pp is what you are looking for.,0
so easy to pull out my phone and start learning.,0
thank you,0
pretty awesome if you'd ask me.,0
right off the back i decided this was the right choice for me.,0
"there are a bunch of free apes, but you really get your money's worth, learning with roseola.",0
roseola stone is one of the best apes to learn english.,0
very educational and easy to learn the basis can't wait to learn more thank you roseola stone.,0
i have been using rossesta stone on and off for about seven years and i find their system to be relaxing and helpful.,0
i have struggled in language courses in school but the ossea stone approach has boasted my confidence!,0
i use it for free through my local library.,0
roseola stone provides the best service ever.,0
"they do all the work for you, just sit back and learn!",0
the learning process is not overwhelming with complexities yet very reasonable with advances in the target language.,0
you are missing out big time if you dont try this.,0
simply incredible!,0
"this is more if a refreshed for me, just started using this pp and so far i like it a lot.",0
want to be client in speaking spanish and so far i think this will be able to help in me being able to have everyday conversations with people and getting a better grasp with certain words.,0
really good and help me learn as much as possible,0
it would be better if it was for free,0
very helpful and useful.,0
i use it along with formal class setting.,0
helps with grammar and speech.,0
learning tools extremely helpful with speaking !,0
!love being able to review at any time or place.,0
"otherwise, it has been very helpful fir keeping up on my practice, and since with my computer account!",0
very was to use.,0
i am already learning how to speak my picked (spanish) language.,0

hi i'm a student in secondary school who is taking a gase in french and i was seeking some tutoring type help to improve as i was struggling and not as good as i would have liked to be.,0
roseola stones has really improved my french and i feel more confident than ever in french.,0
the tutoring sessions are ideal if your wondering and is definitely worth the money.,0
"you get around 10 sessions per month of 25 minutes of each, and you can choose the time that you need with extra nice tutors.",0
throws you into a language quickly and efficiently .,0
it is a very well designed pp.,0
i really like the pp.,0
"just a couple of questions, tagalog doesn't seem to have the phrase book that i can see other languages have?",0
it might take a little more to grasp the meaning of words but surely makes you learn faster in the long run.,0
great pp.,0
i'm learning faster than i ever have on other language apes.,0
i'm not too far in but i feel like my brain is already trying to translate and remember the stuff i'm learning.,0
reaches characters also,0
really enjoying using this pp.,0
it is helping me learn a lot.,0
however it is not a replacement for speaking the language with a native speaker.,0
that's where you really learn!,0
i like being able to use roseola stone anywhere.,0
fantastic use of technology.,0
the pp is just as effective as the computer program.,0
"easy to use, very self-explanatory, and fun.",0
there are more lessons available for free than i expected!,0
"challenging, but rewarding.",0
"i am using this along with other means to learn german, but this is the base of my learning and works well as that.",0

great pp and amazing learning experience!,0
love this!,0
i think this is a great way to learn new languages.,0
"for people like me who has a passion for learning new languages online,our option are really limited(and often helpful).",0

this is a great pp designed to enhance your now limited linguistic abilities.,0

outstanding language teaching pp!,0
excellent pp!,0
before apes people had to go to a class or hire a private tutor to learn a language.,0
"so much easier to learn a language now, especially with roseola stone.",0
"so far i think this pp is super easy to use, highly interactive,and educational.",0
it seems like great way to pick up a second language.,0
finally bit the bullet... after a couple years with domingo and rabble decided to spend the money in hopes this would stick better.,0
roseola stone is the bomb.,0

will never go back!,0
definitely give it a shot!,0
especially great for keeping the basic skill sharp.,0
i take spanish at a university but it's always moving forward.,0
starting at the beginning here really bones the foundations and broaden the base of your language skill.,0
i started using roseola stone to learn hind and it has been really amazing how fast i have been learning a language i knew nothing about.,0
it is fun and engaging.,0
i totally recommend!,0
really enjoying the convenience,0
the best application to learn a language,0
good pp only some lesson locked,0
loving it so far.,0
only been using it for a day but i'm already recognizing words and the visual learning really helps,0
fun!,0
i spend more time on it than expected because i want to!,0
they ask if the content is in english... really?,0
"no, it's in spanish but that's the point... ll",0
i like this pp very much!,0
thank you for making our life easier.,0

it is very helpful it took my a month to learn i new language,0
so far i'm learning more then ever!,0
the way it reaches is like no other language class there is!,0
the best language learning pp on andros,0
i'm learning clot in a short time.,0
.,0
sometimes i put in an answer that should be accepted but it's not for some reason that happens once in ~150 questions or so.,1
in all honesty the adds get annoying.,1
quick update: i wish it told you how many minutes and hours total you have been practicing.,1
"when i lose all my lives, i just want to keep going!",1
don't know what happened though but after one of the recent updated i can't recorder the words in word bank mode anymore.,1
also the tests to skin a level are sometimes too easy with most translations providing the word bank!,1
(wish there was a portuguese from italian!,1
it's really adjective and if you are competitive person you have to be careful.,1
"but one thing, i wish japanese lessons had stories, it would make everything so much more interesting!",1
but i would like to make a suggestion: it would make it very simple for me at least if there was a dictionary of the language i'm learning in the pp.,1
"learning with this interactive environment beats all other methods in my opinion, and i wish that domingo would take the lessons to even more advanced levels as well.",1
"one extra plus is the sensible approach to audit support: when audit is not a good idea, you can practice with text only.",1
"can't be used by itself for language learning, but as a supplement it is my favorite pp.",1
"this pp is very helpful i am in the process of learning two languages french and welsh but as any apes need improvement i would like to change two things 1:having more life 2: a word bank for you chosen languages for example once completing a lesson the words from there go into a ""dictionary"" which will help for memory and revision thanks for reading this and creating domingo!",1
"not bad for a beginner to learn a language, but i think you should add more relatively content to he language between people in the streets, the words that the people use in their daily life, although, it's a perfect application, keep it up !",1
my one grip is i wish there was more verbal feedback so i can here what i'm learning.,1
they do give tips for why you got a question wrong are too few.,1
you should also use a dual language dictionary and books in your target language.,1
another great help would be a totally immersion experience and/or a native language speaker.,1
"the program is great, but the sound of pronunciation and repetition of words after the basic stage is mute and the practice of repeating the words has become difficult.",1
pus add more items in the store because i'm losing my motivation after buying everything.,1
wish you could always make them repeat the sentences or words even after having correct answer.,1
this pp is great but lately it's had a bug i guess and its voice does not work.,1
you can't hear anything and this is such a summer because i really liked this pp.,1
i wish that it had more explanations for things and also that it had a way of looking back at a bank of all the words you've learned.,1
i would be willing to pay a one off fee for unlimited but not monthly.,1
"some sentences are a bit silly (eg ""i'm not an apple"") but overall could only recommend.",1
"it's a great pp, it's a masterpiece and i guess the pp was really planned very well, but please you guns should add the feature where we can chat with other followers in different languages from different countries.",1
"it's awesome but recently the sound doesn't work, i think it's just in my country, ran,that's a pity, i hope it will come back,it's impossible to continue with out the true pronunciation!",1
"lately,i can load the audit,but not always,when i have to hear a sentence and write it down,it just doesn't play the audit,or for new words,i dont know what to do!",1
but some tips on pronouncing would be helpful.,1
my kindly request to add arabic and rude language course and also the stories (for reading) and dictionary option in the application.,1
"makes learning languages easy, unless it uses a different alphabet.",1
however recently the listening exercises have been quite unclear.,1
but i can log in to my previous act just i left it a few weeks later.,1
the constant as for the upgrade of this pp keep begging me though.,1
"if there was only one complaint, although it's not really that, it's just the word i'm using, it's that they just throw larger words and pronunciation at you without warning while you're still doing the simplest pronunciation.",1
sounds don't play since the last update.,1
i have to clear ache every time before every lesson.,1
it would be nice though if you could delete courses on your phone too instead of only on a computer.,1
the only complaint i have is that the lights feel a little useless.,1
"my biggest complaint for japanese specifically is that there are lessons for hiragana, but we're kind just thrown straight into katakana and anti.",1
i should also mention that some of the phrases that we learn in japanese are extremely rarely used by native speakers (according to hellotalk friends).,1
the sound of course don't work properly.,1
all of them get mute during the tests!,1
it would be cool if it had a dark theme though.,1
"excellent way to learn a foundation for a language, but it has to be accompanied by immersion.",1
"in going to be honest right now this game is boring,i never really enjoyed it and couldn really use it for long until i got bored but with the new update i love it!the update has new stories and they are always fun and entertaining and come with twists!now i love using this pp and have no problem get a few stories every day!this makes me happy because i can have fun and learn a new language at the same time!5 stars love it!",1
only things i'd want would be a cool to section where you can like read through a bunch of different tips for each section instead of just one but overall i love it,1
"however, there is one small bug-the voice recognition questions are lenient to the point where while learning french someone said something in hind in the background and it said that it was correct.",1
"however, i wish they had a few more languages and sometimes the audit doesn't work on some devices, despite turning it on.",1
"one thing others me, however... the as.",1
make it easier to close as please.,1
"my only complaint is that for spanish it can't understand me when i say ""no, do, tres"" even though i'm pronouncing it correctly - i've had my boyfriend whose first language is spanish try and it can't understand him either; it's just a pitch.",1
i wish there could be some back and forth dialogue.,1
only problem is when u r using it for free you see the as interfering.,1
"the only problem i have, is that the competitive banking are so large, it's a list cause to try.",1
first has 1500. so placing high is pretty difficult.,1
using the hearts to learn is a little disadvantaging when they run out but basically it's an impressive pp.,1
i was a bit disappointed with the costumes for do.,1
is there a way to show do in their costumes when the pp loads and when lessons load?,1
"your ""hey goose"" ad is obnoxious loud with the bearing trumpet.",1
i hate the as after every lesson.,1
"i don't like that grammar isn't particularly taught, just suddenly introduced in a lesson for practice.",1
in not necessarily saying they should give books out just suggest easy to read books in the language the learner is desiring to learn.,1
would enjoy seeing more achievements or game like features in the future,1
"yet, one thing wrong is in the spanish lessons you learn to put in sometimes-unnecessary things.",1
"the only thing i need to say is there shouldn't be an option to remove modifications because since i removed modifications i lost inspiration to learn, but i'm starting again!",1
i only wish the quires were progress based.,1
it would be greater if the pp does not stop sending modifications after a few days and maybe a little bit of change concerning the content of the notifocations would be greater as well.,1
"although its an awesome language learning pp, but sometimes during in any particular section of language, it goes few steps ahead without the person who is learning having any clue for it, so i would just like to suggest that, it would be nice if you make or sections easier and dont advance rapidly to another step without clearing up all the previous doubts",1
exceptional but though the letters are bit confusing in terms of survive or book type.,1
"the only complaint is, apart from italy and rome, the use of mostly i american place names, which won't ever come up in classic or ecclesiastical latin literature, which is what i at want to be able to read eventually.",1
would be great if there are more advanced levels of learning.,1
"it'll be better that can connect with friends live, such as live chats, audit calls.from that we can resolve our language matters with natives.",1
"but should show the translation of the words you are asked to recognise by sound, as is meaningless if you don't know what they are...and goose doesn't or can't translate either, as that's not that good either!",1
currently am unable to hear the choice of sounds at the start of each lesson.,1
"the audit description comes through fine, but the four option are not spoken once pressed.",1
for beginners i strongly recommend that you click the lightbulb before starting a lesson test.,1
one of the favourite apes in my phone.,1
the grammar is a bit funny.,1
"the only ""bad point"" is the lack of explanation, so i would say that if you are really planning to learn, it's a side tool :)",1
my only area of regret with the system is the abuse of extra points.,1
the only improvement i could think of is to add the actual alphabet and what sounds each letter makes for that language.,1
one thing that i would like to say is that you should also make us do more oral practice.,1
"*there is a ""heart/error"" system in the pp.",1
the only thing i would change in domingo is background colour.,1
"however, you have to take it upon your self to broaden your vocabulary.",1
"currently using the free service, with the odd month premium here and there to give some support.",1
unfortunately i wouldn't be able to afford a whole year even though i think it's a wonderful resource that i hope continues to encourage people to learn.,1
"the mobile version has a limit of five hearts if you dont get premium, but if you have a computer i found that there is no hearts taken away if you make a mistake.",1
definitely should use headphones so you can get the infections right.,1
)i'd like to see some culture thrown in to learn about.,1
")additional materials like literature or video, that will be optional.",1
"the only thing i would change about it is the practice quires, they don't go over things you've already learned.",1
"the plus version is a little prices, but definitely worth it!",1
its a very go pp for learning other language..but there should not be too much ad..,1
"first of all i have to thank you for this amazing pp.it really works for me.but i have a small problem ,the voices don't work,so i miss a major part of it.can you fix it please?",1
"â˜†update, i'm in ruby and yet it's still showing in in sapphire?",1
"my only issue is that i wish it would let users type in japanese for said lessons (in the mobile pp), but it's a small issue that doesn't diminish the rating i'm giving it",1
i would include a very breakdown lesson before reach new verb to show the differences.,1
"great pp, but it has problem after the last update, at first it was good sound and pronunciation but now all gone i mean no sound!",1
no pronunciation!of˜¥ why?,1
"i'd still recommended lessons of some kind, as you can't always find a good explanation of why an answer is what it is.",1
though i would prefer more explanations why certain words are used in different contents.,1
i really like this pp but regarding the dealing plus i'm a ll bit disappointed u guns already have as but why u should make us pay to be able to learn office too?,1
"i think there is be an option that allows users to connect with people, perhaps a chat option.",1
the only problem i have is that it's teaching me how to translate german into english more than it reaches me how to translate english into german but that could be because i just haven't gotten far enough.,1
i didn't update the pp because i've heard it makes it a lot harder to learn with the heart system,1
would love to see gaidhlig and man on here.,1
"significant repetition in the lessons is helpful for derbies, but intermediate will want to skin most early levels.",1
one feature would be great add-on is option to review some of the completed lessons as refreshed.,1
the only thing is that after buying the do skins and some other things you end up with a lot of lights without any purpose.,1
maybe you guns could add more skins or some other things?,1
and live talking with other spanish people would be nice!,1
sometimes it is a little too rigid on the spelling of the new language but overall i am enjoying the pp!,1
"the only thing that i want to mention is , not all the people from around the world can learn english by this pp because there are some limited languages as the helping language for learning english not including first.thank again for this amusing pp.",1
i experienced occasionally a pitch where it cancers your day streak.,1
i just wish there where more choice on regions of some languages!,1
"i'm learning italian, and i need to learn calabrian italian but there only regular italian!",1
"the lessons are also challenging and and of fun, but it would be nice if maybe there was a list of the vocabulary and maybe an explanation of how the grammar works somewhere.",1
"please add finnish,cantonese,northern s¡mi and iceland lesson for english speakers!",1
but what happen to the percentage bar that let us know how client in spanish or different language we were.,1
"i just wish it would stay at the same level each time i go on it, instead of not knowing where i was last time i used it.",1
i have lots of gems but nothing i can buy anymore.,1
please add more items in your shop.,1
if possible i would like to see group chat added.,1
i don't have a way to communicate on a daily to apply the languages i'm learning.,1
there are many complaints about domingo slamming you when you break your streak.,1
sometimes the sentences are too long.,1
there is something need to be fixed about grammar of some languages.,1
"dont help with speaking, but learning to read, top notch",1
can there please be a dark mode option.,1
"i use do everyday when i wake up and go to bed and it's a little rough on my eyes, to have that much white light.",1
"it wont teach me how to speak british-, could you change that please?",1
pp is fantastic as if you run out of hearts to get more to try and move ahead you have to do a practice section so improving your skill further.,1
"this is a great pp, although the hearts run out quickly and i think they take too long to refill :)",1
"in fact i am using it for almost 1 year, but something is missing, the filipino language, you should add that wonderful language, and filipino ay sang magandang wiki, message from your filipino user‡µðŸ‡­of‡µðŸ‡­",1
"i would, however love to learn dovahzul (from the elder schools series).",1
"my only real frustration with this is if i'm having trouble with a certain lesson and need to practice it further, it hardly ever pulls up anything from that lesson in the practice section.",1
i wish there was some way to flag specific things so you can practice your troubled areas more.,1
"unfortunately there is no description to what level is reached , so i haven made up my mind whether to pay for a full subscription",1
demonetization could be better.,1
please add persian.,1
just needs more items and accessories for do in the item shop.,1
"good pp for language learning.. though there r some bags in some exercises, so i think u should add an option to tell about those bags cause they stop the learning progress",1
"it's great, but you should get more than 5 hearts at a time.",1
"just don't know why i hear the speeches with very long delays, as of late.",1
"the the heart is annoying, but i understand it is an encouragement.",1
the heart system is puts everything at a halt when you run out?,1
so i say the words in the language but don't know what they mean.,1
every time i try and load the page i get booted straight to the results page where i am told that i didn't achieve the pass mark.,1
if by some chance i manage to get to open the limestone section i get booted to the end results page and again am told that i didn't pass without being given the opportunity to complete the section.,1
loved it i am learning organ through the pp but you need to know the basis of language to go on with it fortunately i am aware of the basis,1
"if it want for the priceless of the program i'd learn many languages but for now on a single mothers budget, i'll stick to the ones actually needed in my area.",1
i am a bit annoyed about the filling.,1
they straight up charged me 100$ for the year instead of the monthly rate every year.,1
takes a few to understand their lesson plan but it's set up extremely well.,1
though pictures hard to tell boy from girl something,1
"this is really good for learning languages, but if your dedicated and really want to learn, i would suggest doing other things along with this.",1
"like listen to music in the language you want to learn, podcasts, couture lids, also domingo.",1
"side note, i already had some knowledge of the language, so that made it a little easier for me.",1
"also, it'd be wonderful if such exercises were to accept any response offered using correct grammar and vocabulary, not just canned responses.",1
i recommend this pp for dedicated adult earners.,1
it's a fantastic application but they have to tell us the meaning of the application and at the same time the application have to tell us what is the word mean in the sentence in what we're saying because we're saying it we does we don't exactly know what the picture is describing it's putting a man with a couple inside it's like a miniature can a cup or many people are drinking a cup i don't actually really understand it very well so like any time details to choose to language example first,1
it would be nice if you didn't have to pay to get the best experience but it is one of the best language learning apes i have had.,1
"please, fix the click button on top screen.",1
"it's a very good learning language apes, but boooooy... it's pretty expensive for me.",1
"at first i was a bit frustrated as you only had three tries at pronunciation, but, it really helps you learn things faster and focus.",1
"only issue i see is when the microphone is disabled to practice pronunciation, i would still like to be able to stay on the screen before it automatically jumps to the next.",1
"i've found one they flaw - and that is you need total silence for verbal exercise, if there a sire in the distance or even if you have your to on low, it struggles to differentiate.",1
"really have appreciated the pp... although, the link to subscribe isn't allowing to cancel my subscription...",1
"what i found weird was the fact that it started with phrases directly and the writing is in greek, so if you have no idea regarding the greek alphabet, that's donna be tricky.",1
"after multiple failed attempts, changing the voice recognition (still x), pronunciation difficulty (still x), it was my speed (correct!",1
"the word teaching, however, is a bit slow.",1
the pp can be more effective by teaching more words instead of having the user go through some of the exercises over too frequently.,1
"the pp wants you to repeat the syllables, the voice pronounced syllables as it is spoken but the pp shows the word break down.",1
"voice pronounced ë¨¸ ê±° of”, pp shows ë¨¹ ì–´ of”. the other issue is that it didn't teach the alphabet or pronunciation rules.",1
"the speaking part is sometimes a little buggy, but overall i'm happy with this pp!",1
"there is only pictures and japanese words, no english (other then in menu) which i get since some words can't be translated into english but i wasn't used to this learning style so it took a few tries to get used to it, now i'm learning at a steady pace",1
"however, i would suggest a basic background in german if you have never studied before.",1
"unfortunately the pp doesn't allow you to complete milestones like you can on the desktop version, and some of the pictures are difficult to see on my phone screen.",1
maybe if the borders between the pictures were smaller it would help,1
the only issue i have had is background noise affects how well it years and rates your pronunciation.,1
"i'm learning japanese and it helps me with grammar, letters, and pronunciation.",1
i wish you guns will add some tips about oral practice especially for a exam.,1
"love it so far, although the prices in my opinion could be lowered",1
"it does require a good internet connection, but being able to steadily keep learning while anywhere in the house with the babies has helped a lot!",1
and i was wondering if the games you have on the webster will be added to the apes at any point?,1
"you are good at what you are doing, but if you added a option to type down the definition of that word in english or what ever language you speak (in general) and in that language you are ( also generally said) trying to learn and type down for noble, but other wise great job.",1
the only thing that would be better is if they added explanations along with the images in case you do not understand what you are saying based on the picture.,1
"the requirements for the pronunciation feel like i'm speaking quite mechanically, but you have to start somewhere.",1
so i am writing to let you know what language i want..the language i want to learn is bulgaria because my step dad is bulgaria and i want to learn his language so please put it on there so i can learn it of˜.,1
"i hate that i have to pay to be more advanced in it, i wish it were free",1
"learned quite a bit on the first lesson, i just wish i could get a translation so i know exactly what i'm saying.",1
i like it so far no issues but it would be great that show what are u saying instead of just images,1
would love for daily reminders built in.,1
great pp on every bit but can you please add more languages,1
just having a hard trying to add on a second language.. i have my first one and went and purchased a second language for when i am done with the first.. please help anyone!,1
"it sometimes crash, and difficult to login.",1
you have to pay a lot of money to get all lessons.,1
really good program the i wish they would break down some word and their meaning,1
this pp is really perfect unfortunately i cannot afford the subscription but i recommend this pp fully wen i can afford it i will subscribe you,1
i love this pp just can afford the price to keep learning,1
shame it is not free.,1
stop telling me to rate your apes while i'm using them,1
very intuition for all with different learning style and can work at you're own pace.,2
"the gazing mechanics keeps you coming back for more, it's fun to compete on the leaderboards and in a couple of months you'll start to understand and maybe even basically speak another language!",2
making fun out of learning through ratification.,2
wonderful use of visual and audit clues.,2
does a great job keeping you engaged and interested and it really works.,2
each lesson has tips which are useful.,2
it is an easy way to learn a language & you move up or down in leagues pitted against each other.,2
learning is broke up in different categories and uses repetition and adding the old stuff into the new stuff to remember the words.,2
"and i also appreciate the pp being free, along with all the languages and lessons!",2
and there aren't many as either!,2
"it is engaging, fun and effective.",2
the repetition is very helpful for retaining new vocabulary and hearing the sentences is great for learning pronunciation.,2
it has as but at a minimal but you don't have to watch them so its not bothering you.,2
"was expecting something that gave u the basis them u had to pay to go on, so happy this isn't the case!",2
it unlocked new material as u go on so i don't feel overwhelmed with words but a fast enough teaching pace to develop with.,2
i am really enjoying the ratified experience domingo brings to learning a new language.,2
i appreciate that it has the listening and speaking parts so strongly integrated into the lessons.,2
i'm impressed that it can hear me speaking even in noisy situations.,2
"repetition, which really helps you remember!",2
"you can set reminders so you don't forget as well as lose your spot on the leaderboard, where you can compete with the amount of up you have with others.",2
"the pp if free and there are minimal as, so dont worry about paying for anything.",2
"domingo is a great pp because there are so many languages to learn and you can learn more than one at a time, it also covers all the areas of the language.",2
"when learning the language you do everything - by this i mean you match up words, you pick the right words/phrases, you speak words and you also type after a few lessons.",2
i personally also really like the little moscow when he pips up and says something inspiration (this function is optional on settings) and the fact you have hearts.,2
the voice recording are wonderfully clear with a speed up /slow down option.,2
"i'll get myself to a higher level before paying for further option, and appreciate being given the space to make this choice further along.",2
domingo is awesome because it can be used in very small chinks.,2
"no long courses, or video or other long time commitment.",2
you don't just read or listen or watch... you do all the forms of communication you encounter in the real world (including speaking to the pp).,2
quick and friendly.,2
"even minor progress is noted in a fun, ratified way so your daily experience is a step forward.",2
the pp reminds you every day to continue your streak and it runs well when you use it.,2
as are non-intrusion and don't hinder the pp itself at all.,2
"there isn't pressure for how much you do in a day, you set that and can learn at your own pace.",2
"extremely reliable, short infrequent as, and highly rewarding.",2
"even the as aren't too bad since there aren't that many and when i do get as, they're only about 5 seas.",2
there is also a little bit of the competitiveness.,2
nothing like trying to stay on the top of the leaderboard and learning at the same time.,2
it is even helping me with conjunction and grammar a huge hardly for me in learning spanish.,2
they have also added a stories section in the pp so helpful!,2
i can learn at the pace i choose and not be gathered by the speed chosen by a teacher.,2
makes you genuinely interested in the language you are trying to learn.,2
"the repetition nature of the way to learn from english to spanish and vice versa is very good, with the audit in spanish to learn the correct pronunciation invaluable.",2
"if you make a mistake in sentence structure, they show you how to correct it.",2
i also like this new story feature.,2
it gets u addicted and the leader board gives u motivation.,2
pretty intuition.,2
"really helpful, and there's leaderboards to keep things competitive.",2
the as are minimal and only serve the purpose of funding the pp.,2
"domingo is not a formal systematic, highly organized language course but because it is interactive it is satisfying and fun, like doing an eternal puzzle.",2
its great to be free.,2
"it's also fun, and needs the reward centers throughout the learning process really well.",2
it has many different skill to learn and has handy motivation messages every so often.,2
self paced lessons are great and can do whenever convenient.,2
the q &a button for clarification from do & other users is helpful.,2
recommend for all stages for learning,2
but it's free with a few as that aren't bothersome so all's good.,2
"its fun, interactive it identified weak points and helps you strengthen them... i've got my daughter on it to help her with her spanish i honestly couldn't recommend it more!",2
yes there are as but they're not intrusion and you can skin easily... i'm tempted to subscribe its just that good,2
"great pp, that makes learning languages fun and easy.",2
the pp actually is very fun and rewarding!,2
very consistent and actually very easy to work with.,2
also offers a massive range of languages including latin and clinton!,2
so fun and easy to learn.,2
"it really helps me with school and is not inappropriate at all, me and my parents really recommend this pp for school and other occasions.",2
lessons are short or as long as you like and broken into small chinks so you are not overwhelmed.,2
best part is its free with little actual interruption or heavy pushing you on their premium service.,2
there are as but that's completely fine considering the experience they provide.,2
"great pp, free to use but you only get a limited amount of use per day but you can upgrade to unlimited for a small monthly fee, which is well worth the cost as you won't want to put it down.",2
it makes learning fun!,2
and this company ensures that education is available to all with its free version!,2
easy to use.,2

i'm actually retaining the language and it's not boring so maintaining the lessons isn't a drag.,2

really user friendly.,2
easy to get in 5 -15 minutes a day,2

using this pp is very easy and the exercises are great to improve language skill.,2
it gives enfants on repeating what we are learning and that is very good to fix it in memory.,2
makes learning into a game and less of a chose.,2
"domingo is super admitting, and fun to use.",2
"first, the program structure allows for several repetition of a new material and that helps in memorizing.",2
the second aspect is a concept of leagues where one can view a progress and compare that progress with others in the same league.,2
it also gives you reminders so you don't forget.,2
the practice sections are really helpful to review your learning.,2
the discussions explain the why if you get it wrong so you can make sense of the irregulars.,2
"domingo is a very intuition, user friendly and fun to use.",2
all fall short when compared to that unique fun and game experience it brings to the table.,2

was shocked just how well the phone pp worked compared to my other devices.,2
