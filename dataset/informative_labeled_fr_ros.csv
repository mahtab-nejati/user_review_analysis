rosettastone,"constantly states ""check your internet connection"" despite being connected g or wife.",1
rosettastone,won't download lessons in advance either.,1
rosettastone,paid for a 2 year subscription but can't even use it.,1
rosettastone,kept smiling support without response until they replied to tell me my goose fixed 2 isn't supported and to buy another phone!,1
rosettastone,"since the update, the pp asks for a curl login code.",1
rosettastone,it is more expensive than it is worth i would rather have just got babel but sadly now i don't have a choice.,1
rosettastone,it locked me out after using it only 2 months saying it was on another account.,1
rosettastone,"after they charged me again for another $50,i still can't use it again.",1
rosettastone,"this pp isn't engaging enough, i found it boring and slow and it didn't teach me anything.",1
rosettastone,pp keeps telling me sign-in failed.,1
rosettastone,"when i attempted to contact support, chat doesn work either.",1
rosettastone,i can't even log in.,1
rosettastone,"application tried to remove money from my account without my knowledge, she wanted to pay 3 months of english even though i didn't even log in to create a profile on that application, so i do not recommend this application, beware of fraud",1
rosettastone,pp is not opening i tried it on my phone as well as on my friend's phone but its not opening.,1
rosettastone,"can't see the pictures, navigation not intuition.",1
rosettastone,"i tried to use this pp to further my study in the japanese language, but it seems that there is no beginner course.",1
rosettastone,how the hell am i supposed to figure out what the words that i can read with just pictures?,1
rosettastone,the program has the student repeat a russian word or phrase and gives only a picture for the description.,1
rosettastone,"i often for the free trial, and they immediately charged my card $49.",1
rosettastone,i want to like this pp so much but honestly how am i expected to learn a new language if you just tell me to say things with no explanations at all?,1
rosettastone,i get not using english but so far is has taught me nothing but random words with no real in-depth learning of the grammar.,1
rosettastone,"paid full price to have full access to the language learning lessons, but the subscription was not added to my account and i received error messages when trying to use the software.",1
rosettastone,i sent six email to the customer support and only received one reply asking for proof of purchase.,1
rosettastone,the customer support is terrible.,1
rosettastone,(but i'm the unit bottom it says 32 out of 32) please add dark mode.,1
rosettastone,"the pp is so white, learning at night is very tedious on the eyes.",1
rosettastone,"it's pretty expensive for me, make it free, put some adds, i'll never complain about it.",1
rosettastone,"was wrapped by misleading ad for ""free"" trial.",1
rosettastone,they charged for 3 months even though i canceled immediately they kept my money.,1
rosettastone,"the pp is great for learning, and i really anna learn more but when i press on purchase all lessons, the page for paying doesn't appear.",1
rosettastone,i have roseola stone on my computer and it is perfectly fine.,1
rosettastone,the andros pp is trash by comparison and not worth the scene subscription cost.,1
rosettastone,i tried to use it during my morning commune and find that i rarely get a response from the pp when doing pronunciation.,1
rosettastone,you have to scream to get a response.,1
rosettastone,"don't waste your money here, wait for a slickdeals sale and buy the pp version for a one-time fee.",1
rosettastone,"but it updated 2 weeks ago and has since not worked, coming up with an error message whenever i click on a module.",1
rosettastone,i have contracted the support team twice with regards to it and they are yet to respond with anything more than an email giving me a case number.,1
rosettastone,professional and currently just bleeding my bank account for nothing.,1
rosettastone,"they say 30-day guaranteed refund, so i decide to buy the unlimited use japanese version on march and, but i quickly decide (the following day) to cancel it and get it refused, but, i can't!",1
rosettastone,"because i bought it through goose play, i can't get a refund (i tried all the steps they provide, and nothing, goose keeps automatically denying my request).",1
rosettastone,"if you hesitate with your purchase on goose play, you'll get sir*wed over.",1
rosettastone,"2 hours after signing up, 29.99 gets pulled out of my bank even though i canceled as i was aware of auto renew after 3 days.",1
rosettastone,my play store pp is not letting me request a refund (option isn't there?).,1
rosettastone,"when i contracted roseola, they just gave me a link to their pp fads which had nothing to do with refund.",1
rosettastone,didn't care that my money has been taken for a free trial,1
rosettastone,signed me out and won't let me sign back in.,1
rosettastone,"i'm now concealing my subscription after not being able to resolve the issue through customer support, but it's not giving me the option for a return if my funds.",1
rosettastone,"while i get the way you are trying to teach, you still need to add a translation or something to tell the user what they are learning, in the domo for japanese there's 1 question that has no rhyme or reason for why its structures the way it is, you literally have to guess, all 4 pictures it showed had nothing i could see to do with each other, and the fill in the blank it gave had no explanation why it went where it did.",1
rosettastone,the pp is ok but i had to guess the correct answer because it isn't explained what the actual meaning of it is.,1
rosettastone,"but the pp has me saying things but it does not tell me exactly what i was saying, just pictures that i have to guess.",1
rosettastone,"the pp will ask if you are a beginner, intermediate or advanced, but you cannot open any intermediate lesson without buying them, so the only way to try the pp is to start with the very basis, 'hello and goodby'.",1
rosettastone,not buying without trying.,1
rosettastone,"only the application is free, but content is paid.",1
rosettastone,this should be clear in the description.,1
rosettastone,"it wastes the user time ilstalling an application because of wrong, misleading or incomplete information.",1
rosettastone,i do not recommend it for the price.,1
rosettastone,but you find out unlimited is limited real quick.,1
rosettastone,limited to try to get you to fork over more money.,1
rosettastone,i want to give it 5 stars honestly it helped me learn spanish... but it also kept charging me $25 a month without my knowledge!,1
rosettastone,"what is even worse is they charge you before they say they will, my subscription was apparently supposed to renew on the with but i was charged a day early on the with and they refuse to refund anything.",1
rosettastone,keeps locking me out of the nodules.,1
rosettastone,"but i never use this pp before, how can it say that my email have already used.",1
rosettastone,it will not let me log in or make a free account i have tried everything and still won't work.,1
rosettastone,wont let me cancel my subscription,1
rosettastone,the cos will not work at all on a chromebook as well.,1
rosettastone,"i can't help but be really confused it's making me say long sentences out loud on the first day with barely any practice, and it's driving me insane how many times i have to try.",1
rosettastone,money hungry.,1
rosettastone,the company wont give you the mobile languages even though i purchased the desktop versions.,1
rosettastone,"so this pp wants me to spend around 1,000 dollars so i can practice both on my desktop and on mobile?",1
rosettastone,waste of my money for a 3 months access for $50 when all i get is few core lessons or force to go full access for extra $100-200 so disappointed from this waste of my money and time for basic free trial lessons (but for $50),1
rosettastone,when i tried a trial period which was suggested in this pp it took money from my goose account.,1
rosettastone,never could get the voice phases to work properly.,1
rosettastone,i dont use it anymore and they are still charging me.,1
rosettastone,"yet another booooring subscription pp from greedy developer, that don't bother to explain clearly that this is a subscription pp, before installing.",1
rosettastone,don't download this pp if you are an english speaker looking to learn first.,1
rosettastone,from course one you are asked to repeat long sentences.,1
rosettastone,"if you can't read first, you have to do this purely by audit (listening+repeating) which for many earners isn't possible.",1
rosettastone,it's not free so couldn't even give it a try.,1
rosettastone,there were no basis to the alphabet.,1
rosettastone,the pp does not show the translations in english like it says it does and there is no support,1
rosettastone,it's not the right way for a beginner to learn .,1
rosettastone,you can't just say a word over and over and have it written in japanese .,1
rosettastone,but it doesn't say what the word means or anything,1
rosettastone,pp doesn't work anymore on chromebook.,1
rosettastone,so disappointing that this pp does not offer at least one african language option.,1
rosettastone,swahili is a language spoken widely throughout africa and this is not an option available on the pp.,1
rosettastone,you get a free trial period but you have to make a subscription to it.,1
rosettastone,verbal is off on the phone.,1
rosettastone,"""sales department"" takes my money and gives me the wrong language and i call 5 minutes later for them to tell me sales department cannot cancel or change orders.",1
rosettastone,"only ""customer service"", which is closed, can change orders.",1
rosettastone,no authorization given for charges!,1
rosettastone,it did not show me what i was saying in english but only filipino.,1
rosettastone,i have the 5 day learning thing for learning a language and it has said for the past three days that i'm done learning for the day as soon as i open the pp.,1
rosettastone,i haven't been able to do any of the core lessons because i have to buy them and i personally think that the plans are way too expensive.,1
rosettastone,$50 for only 3 months??,1
rosettastone,wont let me cancel my subscription,1
rosettastone,thought it was free...i installed...will my card be killed,1
rosettastone,"terrible , didn't teach me anything just went strait ahead to the hard stuff even though it was on basic.",1
rosettastone,i can't find a way to remove the account.,1
rosettastone,how to delete the account?,1
rosettastone,this game wouldn't tell me the means of the word so i couldn't find the answer,1
rosettastone,can't cancel same day and get refund.,1
rosettastone,doesn't recognise correct speech.,1
rosettastone,buggy interface on my andros device makes replying sounds frustration because the pp thinks you are selecting an answer.,1
rosettastone,"also the mid is unable to differentiate even simple absent noise, making the spoken exercises impossible in anything other than a silent padded room.",1
rosettastone,poor pp design.,1
rosettastone,"i finished all 12 units of japanese for school, just to get told that i haven't done the writing lessons, which aren't even available on the pp!",1
rosettastone,"also, the speech recognition needs work.",1
rosettastone,"i've had several instances where i said the correct answer perfectly, and all the words lit up as correct, but then it gives me a red ""x"" and i have to say it again.",1
rosettastone,"i'm making no progress whatsoever, i'd recommend learning arabic a different way.",1
rosettastone,the microphone performance is extremely louse.,1
rosettastone,"nor can you select or even see what input device is being used, if for example a bluetooth device is connected.",1
rosettastone,"thank you roseola stone, for being the most expensive language learning pp you have failed to deliver on the most critical feature.",1
rosettastone,it tries to offer the same functionality like the desktop but fails.,1
rosettastone,"the problems that i encountered are: 1.the pictures are too small, 2.is lacking functionality of the desktop version, 3.twitching between japanese alphabet is a pain, 4.the pp sometimes forgets the credentials, 5.it requires constant internet connection even if you choose to download the lesson.",1
rosettastone,"speech recognition sometimes works... for a product asking for so much money, i would expect more.",1
rosettastone,very sluggish pace.,1
rosettastone,"-animation take too much time, to the point where it's 30 seconds animation for 1 click.",1
rosettastone,the idea of the pp is amazing but it's very hard without any english words to learn chinese!,1
rosettastone,sometimes i can't understand what those characters mean and it's very hard to use by the sound inman to translate them into english in goose translator.,1
rosettastone,"not good for kiss,it is very hard to recognize kiss voice.",1
rosettastone,too expensive.,1
rosettastone,"but, you have to buy the pp.",1
rosettastone,and it's not cheap.,1
rosettastone,mio it should be included in the (not cheap) price of the d program.,1
rosettastone,way too expensive and not a great way to learn.,1
rosettastone,if you want to learn a language this pp is good to instal but when you are learning the language it asks you to say a certain phrase but it always says that the audit is too loud.,1
rosettastone,pp requires microphone lessons.,1
rosettastone,the software shouldn't only be pictures.,1
rosettastone,it should be a combination of their current software with spoken definitions.,1
rosettastone,it's not picking up my voice.,1
rosettastone,"i have remained, treated but i don't get a response.",1
rosettastone,"not great for learning, audit technology is not great.",1
rosettastone,"canceled my subscription on goose play, but then got charged again through their webster, with no way to contact them to get my $80 back.",1
rosettastone,the andros pp does not have translations.,1
rosettastone,i was saying the words exactly the same and each time it recorded something different.,1
rosettastone,too expensive.,1
rosettastone,i wasn't able to login in to my account on the mobile pp.,1
rosettastone,after i forgot something it wouldn't let me do it again even though i used the rest button.,1
rosettastone,just pictures and the program saying words.,1
rosettastone,i bet its amazing but i can't afford it because i don't have the money for it (it's $94.99 a month),1
rosettastone,how do you close the pp?,1
rosettastone,"if you back out to the main menu and then click on a lesson, the wrong lesson comes up and you have to stroll through the lessons subfolders until you find the one you are looking for.",1
rosettastone,the only thing i would add is the enunciation under the word.,1
rosettastone,i'm learning hebrew and i wish they would show the english version of what i'm learning because i have no idea what i'm really saying.,1
rosettastone,"the pp so far is pretty good; however it keeps crashing, has required 2 starts and it a little buggy on some of the screens.",1
rosettastone,"too advanced, i don't recommend for beginners",1
rosettastone,great pp but not consumer friendly as far as pricking and payment goes.,1
rosettastone,$200 is too much up front to clock all of the units and i'm unwilling to pay monthly for something i'll never own.,1
rosettastone,i would be much more willing to pay to clock units as i progress.,1
rosettastone,there 20 units for spanish and i'd lady pay $10 to clock each unit as i progress.,1
rosettastone,having problem putting new amazon prime purchase key into old learning pp from trial.,1
rosettastone,hard to navigable at times,1
rosettastone,the two problems that i have are not having any explanation of what grammar i am learning and no way for me to gauge how well my pronunciation is.,1
rosettastone,most of the time you can get the gist of what the program is trying to teach you but outside of word memorization i feel like i would get more out of having an explanation of the lesson before taking the practices,1
rosettastone,when you try to pronounce a word sometimes the just doesn't hear it no matter how loud you are.,1
rosettastone,"can you please fix the bug were it is not testing my speech, just going to the next picture.",1
rosettastone,i wish i didn't need a computer to have the live sessions.,1
rosettastone,"i can't use the total version, when i'm not home.",1
rosettastone,good to start basic vietnamese with lacking in learning layout should start with alphabet learning first then go onto grammar structure instead its reversed but overall it's good program,1
rosettastone,"great pp, but it's just too expensive.",1
rosettastone,but there is no back feature in this pp.,1
rosettastone,"there are several very annoying bags:  - periodically it starts ""continue automatically to next screen"" even when this option is turned off;  -  sometimes it does not recognize the voice;  - long loading time;  - after started shows the random lesson in the unit to learn instead of the first to be done.",1
rosettastone,the pp is extremely frustration when it comes to pronunciation.,1
rosettastone,it says the word once and then just buzzed you if you say it wrong and wants you to try again without saying it to you again to help you get it right.,1
rosettastone,its a good pp but i mean it gives you a monthly pay but you actually have to pay the whole price for the term its very irritating because i want to pay monthly.... due to the fact that i dont know how long it will take me to finish the course but i can and i dont want to have to pay a 6 month subscription if in donna finish in just 4 months or have to buy a 6 month and then not finish and have to buy the three month set only not to use the whole three month set,1
rosettastone,much better on the computer version in my opinion.,1
rosettastone,many of the buttons on mobile are difficult to press without his-clinking such as the play button to hear something before selecting it.,1
rosettastone,"2 lessons and then you have to pay to go farther, otherwise i would give it a better rating!",1
rosettastone,love it so far but i wish i knew exactly what i'm saying as i'm looking at the pictures.,1
rosettastone,it does not start with alphabet or pronunciation.,1
rosettastone,i just got thrown into random conversations.,1
rosettastone,"sadly did not have the language i was looking to learn, but i can tell it is a very helpful and immersion program to learn a new language.",1
rosettastone,needs improvement in voice recognition.,1
rosettastone,very expensive.,1
rosettastone,i can log in on the web via my school webster but not the pp.,1
rosettastone,use too much time to download of unit.,1
rosettastone,pretty good wish it had does with it,1
rosettastone,i hate that you have to pay to get the full access,1
rosettastone,pp wont work with andros device?,1
rosettastone,"- samson galaxy 8 i'd love to provide a 5 star review, but as technical support doesn't seem to be able to get my account to work on andros devices (which is what i have) i can use the product i purchased.",1
rosettastone,same here the program today started to pitch i cannot access my plan.,1
rosettastone,i had to sign in again and looks like all my progress saved is gone.,1
rosettastone,"also the audit was struggling to use either with wired headphones, bluetooth or just my phone microphone.",1
rosettastone,it's stuck in office mode.,1
rosettastone,"excellent, but needs an option to rest all lessons, not just one at a time which is too cumbersome when wanting to start after a period away",1
rosettastone,in the past you could slow the pronunciation.,1
rosettastone,mostly good only issue that i'm having is occasionally the pp/ or phone is not picking up what i say,1
rosettastone,it very good learning apes but the in pp price is high pus make it 10$ for a month otherwise it's a good pp,1
rosettastone,a little prices but helps a lot.,1
rosettastone,i'd say getting a brand new phone or using a good microphone would indefinitely help.,1
rosettastone,"i only wish that it would explain the grammar more, as in why the grammar is different i certain situations.",1
rosettastone,it's a bit frustration when it doesn't recognize the word i'm trying to say though.,1
rosettastone,good pp for learning but it costs a lot .,1
rosettastone,a four only in that it is immersion and having a tough time connecting the dots.,1
rosettastone,some hints on purity and fiction in early stages might help in particular with non-neuro based language.,1
rosettastone,"easy to learn, good for beginners but would be good if you didn't need to repeat activities if you got them all correct in the core activities!",1
rosettastone,i love the experience and the ability to learn from this pp the only thing i wish was different is for there to be a way to earn more lessons or even just the ability to get the lessons cheaper.,1
rosettastone,"if i had no previous hebrew studies, this pp would not be very helpful.",1
rosettastone,the voice recognition needs improvement though.,1
rosettastone,it is very good but all of it needs to be free.,1
rosettastone,communication should be free!,1
rosettastone,"pretty good, wish i could get to the level in already at and go from there but the beginning stages are a good refreshed",1
rosettastone,but i wish you let your users try until they get it correct.,1
rosettastone,wish i could repeat it over and over to ensure retention.,1
rosettastone,very good but its a bit annoying u have to pay,1
rosettastone,i am not able to find the option to change from beginner to intermediate on my pp.,1
rosettastone,the audit analysis is great at telling you when you've not pronounced a word correctly however it's not great at helping you improve.,1
rosettastone,"great pp, bit expensive and it is limited in that once you've done the 20 units that's it, nothing more.",1
rosettastone,i think you need both as grammar isn't really explained.,1
rosettastone,tried to sign up on their webster but due to some pitch could subscribe.,1
rosettastone,contracted customer service but what seemed to me an automatic reply.,1
rosettastone,overall pp is good but expensive and limited.,1
rosettastone,"i recommend learning in conjunction with an audit program to get additional speaking practise in (with makarin, it's all about the intonation).",1
rosettastone,"a bit on the expensive side, but if you can get a half price deal i'd say it's worth it.",1
rosettastone,one criticism is that the reading lessons in unit one are so ridiculously easy they feel like a waste of time,1
rosettastone,"i made an account for the japanese unit and my only issues is sometimes, the voice lessons don't work and you have to start the pp.",1
rosettastone,the other issue is that you can only do unit 1 without paying money.,1
rosettastone,"i got it to learn more english well and work on my pronunciation, so far i think it is working, the only down side is that you can't log onto another device until you log out in your other device.",1
rosettastone,i use this pp with my lawton the most and there has been instances where i forgets to log out and can't use the pp during my lunch at work on my phone or tablet.,1
rosettastone,i don't like that it can't be opened on multiple devices.,1
rosettastone,most certain to speaking.,1
rosettastone,"unless you have a professional level microphone, it will tell you that you failed the first time, but upon saying the word or phrase a second time, it will say you got it 100% correct.",1
rosettastone,"i do wish there was more help with pronunciation, like if i get a word wrong repetitively, i'd like to be given the option for extra physics help.",1
rosettastone,"i use domingo along with this, because being able to write(type) out words helps me learn them and that is one thing this pp is missing.",1
rosettastone,"also would be nice to have a ""general grammar rule"" section to reference for help.",1
rosettastone,you never know if you are perceiving it wrong and therefore learning the language wrong.,1
rosettastone,"if using this pp, learn the words first on another pp but then use this one to practice those basis.",1
rosettastone,"i like it a lot and it is really helpful to visualized and pronounce these words, but without telling you the definitions it can be difficult.",1
rosettastone,but some lessons seem not optimized for phone size as pictures seem too small or his allied with caution bubbles.,1
rosettastone,also seems to miss some of the desktop apes features like character selection.,1
rosettastone,for japanese there did not seem to be a way to tongue to only hiragana and karagina.,1
rosettastone,pretty good but i think it starts at a weird place ??,1
rosettastone,maybe it's made for people who already have some knowledge on the language.,1
rosettastone,i wish they also translated what it all meant weather just have us guess ??,1
rosettastone,the only reason the pp is not five stars is because every once in a while it won't register my voice.,1
rosettastone,so i either fail or have to say a phrase or word multiple times for it to register.,1
rosettastone,"i do feel like the multiple choice makes it easy to make educated guesses, but maybe it works out in the long run.",1
rosettastone,i seem to have some issues though between singing.,1
rosettastone,"every time i open the pp it says congratulations on finishing week, even though i'm on week 3. there's a button that takes me to my latest though so it's not too much of a bother, but still weird.",1
rosettastone,the speech recognition is spot though.,1
rosettastone,i really like roseola stone because they teach you how you pronounce the words but i just wish that they gave you an actual schedule to follow that shows what you should do everyday because i have found some other things on the pp that i didn't even know were there or when to use them.,1
rosettastone,"more interactive, work on conversation actually saying the words, like the speaking analyse so know saying it right.",1
rosettastone,just need to have short note why something right or wrong answer in grammar.,1
rosettastone,the program has a difficult time with speech recognition during exercises requiring me to respond verbally.,1
rosettastone,"but it'd be better if there were basic alphabet of the languages, plus, the words' translation (from pictures) into our selected native language.",1
rosettastone,recognition skill develop quickly but pronunciation skill need more work.,1
rosettastone,i am learning vietnamese some of the words don't mean the same thing.,1
rosettastone,it said that ong and ba is an older man or woman but i was corrected and told it's elderly man or woman.,1
rosettastone,it would be better for me if it focused on recreational words and phrases since my trip is for fun not business but it works,1
rosettastone,having a slight issue with the speech recognition but overall i love the new format.,1
rosettastone,some thumbnail photo are too small to be easily understood on a phone screen.,1
rosettastone,"good simple bite size learning you can fit around your day, hard to work out if the voice recognition issues are my microphone or the software.",1
rosettastone,"great pp, little prices but worth it!!!",1
rosettastone,4 stars only because the mobile doesn't include noweigen as an option yet!,1
rosettastone,"works pretty well on the mobile pp, just the occasional issue having to repeat into the mid.",1
rosettastone,would like more of a word to picture game for beginners.,1
rosettastone,i started using this pp to learn japanese for travel but i'm having issues fully understanding it just because it doesn't actually directly translate and tell me what each word means,1
rosettastone,seems to have trouble picking up my accent/tone.,1
rosettastone,i get some pronunciation correct but it says i did not.,1
rosettastone,"the teaching method is great, my only complaint is that there's not an easy way to review if you get out of the habit of studying.",1
rosettastone,"would like to see the games available via pp on the pp; otherwise, works as described!",1
rosettastone,"very good, albeit phone mid sometime gets drowned out by fan and other common absent noise",1
rosettastone,"i love it except that the accuracy bar doesn display when you reply words your struggling with, with make me struggle more.",1
rosettastone,sometimes voice detection hangs/laws making me repeat the phrase or word.,1
rosettastone,too much anti for the first lesson.,1
rosettastone,prefer more hiragana and katakana.,1
rosettastone,i turned off the microphone and now it doesn't enable it anymore.,1
rosettastone,singing between multiple devices needs to get a little better but overall good,1
rosettastone,this is a good language pp but it takes too long to load.,1
rosettastone,"i say the words, and it says, i said it wrong, ink what that's all about.",1
rosettastone,good pp sometimes laws behind and appears to get stuck occasionally but otherwise very useful,1
rosettastone,its done and kind fun but i really wish it could have nothing but argentina accent... but fun may to learn spanish...like i wish i could have an argentina setting a know,1
rosettastone,awesome so far but wish it had more free content.,1
rosettastone,some of the pictures are hard to make out.,1
rosettastone,other than the price of subscription it's perfect,1
rosettastone,excellent except the voice recognition is touch,1
rosettastone,its great the the words need to be pronounced more clearly!,1
rosettastone,doesn't really give the translation,1
rosettastone,although a great pp i wish it wasn't so expensive :(,1
rosettastone,pretty good for learning vietnamese although some prior knowledge of the language may be necessary,1
rosettastone,"it's too fast for a novice..please allow more time on pronunciation and grammar other than that, it's rrrr-eat!",1
rosettastone,right now a four just started simple but still a little slow when learning spanish,1
rosettastone,lost progress on phone.,1
rosettastone,i wish i could clock the full version but it is too expensive.,1
rosettastone,i need to log in every lesson,1
rosettastone,doesn't have all the features/lessons web does,1
rosettastone,i think this pp should add the meanings of the words before letting us say them,1
rosettastone,"it's slow, but fun.",1
rosettastone,good program but more like guessing game.,1
rosettastone,doesn't teach what i am exactly saying or grammar santa etc.,1
rosettastone,every time i try and load the page i get booted straight to the results page where i am told that i didn't achieve the pass mark.,1
rosettastone,if by some chance i manage to get to open the limestone section i get booted to the end results page and again am told that i didn't pass without being given the opportunity to complete the section.,1
rosettastone,loved it i am learning organ through the pp but you need to know the basis of language to go on with it fortunately i am aware of the basis,1
rosettastone,"if it want for the priceless of the program i'd learn many languages but for now on a single mothers budget, i'll stick to the ones actually needed in my area.",1
rosettastone,i am a bit annoyed about the filling.,1
rosettastone,they straight up charged me 100$ for the year instead of the monthly rate every year.,1
rosettastone,takes a few to understand their lesson plan but it's set up extremely well.,1
rosettastone,though pictures hard to tell boy from girl something,1
rosettastone,"this is really good for learning languages, but if your dedicated and really want to learn, i would suggest doing other things along with this.",1
rosettastone,"like listen to music in the language you want to learn, podcasts, couture lids, also domingo.",1
rosettastone,"side note, i already had some knowledge of the language, so that made it a little easier for me.",1
rosettastone,"also, it'd be wonderful if such exercises were to accept any response offered using correct grammar and vocabulary, not just canned responses.",1
rosettastone,i recommend this pp for dedicated adult earners.,1
rosettastone,it's a fantastic application but they have to tell us the meaning of the application and at the same time the application have to tell us what is the word mean in the sentence in what we're saying because we're saying it we does we don't exactly know what the picture is describing it's putting a man with a couple inside it's like a miniature can a cup or many people are drinking a cup i don't actually really understand it very well so like any time details to choose to language example first,1
rosettastone,it would be nice if you didn't have to pay to get the best experience but it is one of the best language learning apes i have had.,1
rosettastone,"please, fix the click button on top screen.",1
rosettastone,"it's a very good learning language apes, but boooooy... it's pretty expensive for me.",1
rosettastone,"at first i was a bit frustrated as you only had three tries at pronunciation, but, it really helps you learn things faster and focus.",1
rosettastone,"only issue i see is when the microphone is disabled to practice pronunciation, i would still like to be able to stay on the screen before it automatically jumps to the next.",1
rosettastone,"i've found one they flaw - and that is you need total silence for verbal exercise, if there a sire in the distance or even if you have your to on low, it struggles to differentiate.",1
rosettastone,"really have appreciated the pp... although, the link to subscribe isn't allowing to cancel my subscription...",1
rosettastone,"what i found weird was the fact that it started with phrases directly and the writing is in greek, so if you have no idea regarding the greek alphabet, that's donna be tricky.",1
rosettastone,"after multiple failed attempts, changing the voice recognition (still x), pronunciation difficulty (still x), it was my speed (correct!",1
rosettastone,"the word teaching, however, is a bit slow.",1
rosettastone,the pp can be more effective by teaching more words instead of having the user go through some of the exercises over too frequently.,1
rosettastone,"the pp wants you to repeat the syllables, the voice pronounced syllables as it is spoken but the pp shows the word break down.",1
rosettastone,"the speaking part is sometimes a little buggy, but overall i'm happy with this pp!",1
rosettastone,"there is only pictures and japanese words, no english (other then in menu) which i get since some words can't be translated into english but i wasn't used to this learning style so it took a few tries to get used to it, now i'm learning at a steady pace",1
rosettastone,"however, i would suggest a basic background in german if you have never studied before.",1
rosettastone,"unfortunately the pp doesn't allow you to complete milestones like you can on the desktop version, and some of the pictures are difficult to see on my phone screen.",1
rosettastone,maybe if the borders between the pictures were smaller it would help,1
rosettastone,the only issue i have had is background noise affects how well it years and rates your pronunciation.,1
rosettastone,"i'm learning japanese and it helps me with grammar, letters, and pronunciation.",1
rosettastone,i wish you guns will add some tips about oral practice especially for a exam.,1
rosettastone,"love it so far, although the prices in my opinion could be lowered",1
rosettastone,"it does require a good internet connection, but being able to steadily keep learning while anywhere in the house with the babies has helped a lot!",1
rosettastone,and i was wondering if the games you have on the webster will be added to the apes at any point?,1
rosettastone,"you are good at what you are doing, but if you added a option to type down the definition of that word in english or what ever language you speak (in general) and in that language you are ( also generally said) trying to learn and type down for noble, but other wise great job.",1
rosettastone,the only thing that would be better is if they added explanations along with the images in case you do not understand what you are saying based on the picture.,1
rosettastone,"the requirements for the pronunciation feel like i'm speaking quite mechanically, but you have to start somewhere.",1
rosettastone,"i hate that i have to pay to be more advanced in it, i wish it were free",1
rosettastone,"learned quite a bit on the first lesson, i just wish i could get a translation so i know exactly what i'm saying.",1
rosettastone,i like it so far no issues but it would be great that show what are u saying instead of just images,1
rosettastone,would love for daily reminders built in.,1
rosettastone,great pp on every bit but can you please add more languages,1
rosettastone,just having a hard trying to add on a second language.. i have my first one and went and purchased a second language for when i am done with the first.. please help anyone!,1
rosettastone,"it sometimes crash, and difficult to login.",1
rosettastone,you have to pay a lot of money to get all lessons.,1
rosettastone,really good program the i wish they would break down some word and their meaning,1
rosettastone,this pp is really perfect unfortunately i cannot afford the subscription but i recommend this pp fully wen i can afford it i will subscribe you,1
rosettastone,i love this pp just can afford the price to keep learning,1
rosettastone,shame it is not free.,1
rosettastone,stop telling me to rate your apes while i'm using them,1
