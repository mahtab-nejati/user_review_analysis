purchased the plus subscription at the end of october 2019 for 6 months and paid upfront.,0
today when doing a lesson the new year promotion popped up and after closing it my plus subscription is no longer active.,1
i still have until the end of april but can't find a way to reinstate the plus features.,1
tried reporting it through the help centre but that has a bug too and i'm ubable to submit my request.,1
please help!,0
good and useful but still frustrating when it gives you red for obvious fatfingering.,0
"on languages with sound recognition exercises, it needs translations of the sound bits when they have meaning on their own.",0
that would help memorizing the characters.,0
this app isn't about learning anymore but a competition to stay in the league.,1
i try to learn for hours daily but i still get demoted and it's so frustrating.,1
i end up doing stories to stay in the league instead of learning.,1
it's frustrating.,0
i'll have to look for another app that is strictly for learning and not competing with imaginary people,1
never make learning process a competition.,1
one should learn slowly and with efficiency.,0
competing in leagues and striving to secure place in top 10 has been one of the worst experiences.,1
"and this new health system is freaking, people learn with mistakes and they should be let to do so.",1
i agree that it is one of the best platforms to learn a language but that doesn't mean you impose so many unnecessary things.,0
better duolingo changes the way of health and the leagues.,1
"it was very good at first, but now it does not play sounds and pronunciations an there is no support for this problem",1
unusable.,0
"towards the end of each lesson, there is a question with a fill in the blank.",0
a typing box or multiple choices don't show up at all and causes me to have to exit the lesson uncompleted.,0
"after the recent update, the pronunciation of the words and and sentences are gone.",1
i have to go on learning without sound and voice guide.,1
the app bothers me several times per day and they send me multiple emails per day to keep practicing.,1
i don't need to be harassed multiple times per day & i certainly don't need to justify or explain myself for not continuing to practice.,0
enough is enough.,0
"great app without hearts, but really sucks with them.",1
i had about 150 days without the hearts (lives).,0
then they showed up.,0
you get five lives a day and then you lose one for every simple mistake.,1
they justify the hearts by saying that you won't learn new material if you spend too much time on the app.,1
"this seems to be a flat out lie, because everything else is geared to making you want to spend more time learning, leagues, xp's, etc.",1
the paid version has unlimited lives = real reason.,0
"app asks, what language do you speak but it's not showing urdu neither i want to read text in urdu , i prefer english text but i have to select environment from those languages which i can't even read .. why we must have to choose our language while we installed english version of app there must be no restrictions on selecting language for environment as it can stay in english and user can learn any of your given language.",1
with latest update they shortened the number of lessons per level.,0
"while it makes it quicker to breeze through and collect crowns, you end up retaining far less of the content.",0
"previous version, if you didnt want to grind you could test out of a level.",0
that was better because users could move on when ready.,0
"now it is basically just a flash card game app, not a true language course.",1
i've canceled my subscription.,0
the heart feature they have added is useless - if it is my goal to learn a language in 3 months and i'm limited to 10 mistakes a day i'm not going to get very far!,1
"looks like people who have an old version of the app don't have this problem too, which is even more frustrating!",0
i love this app and the ethos of providing free languages to the masses.,0
"however, i hate the streaks and the leaderboard, i don't want to compete with others.",1
i want to learn at my own pace.,1
"i don understand why i can't turn these two ""features"" off.",0
they're anxiety inducing and made me quit this app.,0
"i love this app, though was hacked pretty badly after making exceptional progress and can't get my money back for the plus account and haven't received a response after reporting it three times.",1
they need a way to log out of all locations and two-factor authentication to fix these types of issues.,1
"i had to disable my account after two years of progress, start over after a 69-day streak, and lost everything.",1
someone is still using my plus account for free while i start completely over w/ads.,0
:(,0
i am changing my rating again on this app again.,0
"it used to crash a lot, that has been fixed.",1
now i have an app telling me i don't know how to read and write languages that i grew up with.,1
"if the people that designed this app are so smart, i dare them to try and live one day on the streets of la speaking the spanish they say is spanish.",1
zero.,0
i've used this app for over a year and a half.,0
"the recent update has changed several things i'm unhappy about, and i'm about ready to delete it.",0
many people are visual learners.,0
why take this away when going back to prior lessons to get a refresher on words?,0
"also, the lack of help is awful in the app.",1
"no explanations, just hints on how languages work.",0
i also tried duolingo plus and it's not worth the money.,1
the new hearts addition is basically negative reinforcement.,1
i no longer like this app.,0
i used to love this app.,0
"while researching on how to learn a language, i learned that intensity is the most effective practice method.",0
"now, before this update, i could do that.",0
i could go hours picking up this knowledge and being able to hold it in.,0
"however, after the recent update with this awful heart system, i can no longer continue with my usual method of learning.",1
"not only that, it punishes students for making mistakes.",0
"mistakes are going to be made, duhhhh!",0
so why make this update?,0
"hey , if you are learning any asian language for example korean , hindi etc.",0
than this app isnt the one you should use!~ its worst for learning korean!,0
"actually , the words don't sound like its written.",1
and it had the worst start i guess!,1
first level (basics) should be hangul i guess :| (imo) .,0
"either way , i learned hangul from internet , but i got insantly confused when i learnt the same on duo app!",0
"sorry to say , but its the worst app to learn korean.",1
really good for french/spanish etc tho!~,1
this app is useless now.,0
especially with mandarin.,0
it just throws random characters at you and you have to figure out what they are and how they are used.,1
the things you have to learn are not useful and therefore are terrible to learn when you're just starting.,0
i got this app.,0
to brush up on my latin.,0
at first it was good but the audio portions are muffled and with egg making it difficult to discern the speech.,1
"also when it asks me to type the latin i hear, when i do it says i am typing in english.",1
poor quality control.,1
"i would have kept it, but it is unreliable and has many defects.",0
it is not an app.,0
to be trusted.,0
uninstalled.,0
i've been a loyal user for about 5 years now and had no complaints until very recently.,0
duo has a new feature that exists solely to frustrate and dishearten learners.,0
"after devoting a lot of time and energy into completing a lesson, duo will now arbitrarily pick completed lessons to rob users of and then demand that the they redo what they've already done in order to ""restore"" the accomplishment that duo has arbitrarily stolen.",0
it's infuriating.,0
"""health"" (whatever that is) runs out every time you make a tiniest mistake.",1
"i failed to type the final ""m"" in ""mom"" at the end of a (somewhat lengthy) sentence, and it immediately erased a portion of my health find a better way to handle free users, or i'll find another way to practise my foreign language skills....",1
"the language lists are not in alphabetical order which makes finding a language tricky, then the actual teaching doesn't help because they just say words so fast you can't really catch the proper pronunciation.",1
"to properly learn a language you need to be shown how to get your tongue around the words, not just butcher the spelling into your own language.",0
duolingo has tricked me into paying again for the subscription by saying i lost my 397 day streak when i didn't as i had streak freeze bought.,1
it has something to do with checking the app right after midnight.,0
"now i payed 10$ for the subscrition, had to cancel the reecuring payments, checked the app, got back my streak, but the monthly streak repair (the reason i bought the subscription) wasn't used up.",1
meaning duolingo lied to me into paying.,1
this is the last time.,0
i want my money back.,0
(update) not only do i get charged ingots to watch ads instead of being given ingots.,0
i have now lost all my ingots for skipping a day.,1
so now i can't get another streak freeze because it decided to take all my ingots along with it.,0
pretty sure it's just trying to jip me at any chance so i buy the plys version.,0
"it was a fund app at first, but i feel it's gone downhill",0
leaderboard still sucks (cheaters and cheesers).,0
i used plus for a month and it sucked because offline mode is super buggy and it doesn't download enough lessons at a time.,1
you also lose your streak unless connected to the internet every day so i lost my nearly 300 day streak even though i studied offline every day!,1
finally single month sub cost should be closer to 6/12mon sub costs- like $8/month.,1
it's not right to have to spend $13/mon for the same thing bc i'm too poor to pay $50 at once.,1
"cannot delete a language properly, it just replaces it whenever you delete a course.",1
"mobile app is extremely inferior to the desktop version, esp.",1
concerning the health system.,0
"alternative answers from english to other languages are not accepted, despite them being valid in the language spoken.",1
"doesn't explain why you got something wrong, esp.",1
"concerning grammar, syntax and conjugation.",0
get rid of the hearts!,1
this app could be amazing if they would get rid of the hearts/lives aspect of it.,1
having to wait 5 hours while trying to learn a new language is making this harder than it already is.,1
"get a heart, start a lesson, but once you make another mistake you are back to waiting another 5 hours.",1
cynical money grab.,1
"i use this app all the time, and they've just added 'lives' meaning if you run out, the app locks you out so you can't learn until they get restored after a period of time or you buy more.",1
this is a dreadful update and will certainly negatively affect my experience.,1
so much for free learning.,0
used this for french.,0
the male and the female pronounced words differently.,1
someone struggling with pronunciations will never get better if the app isn't consistent itself.,1
i also felt like it didn't cover grammar at all.,1
your bug report section doesn't work 1. launch application around 11pm.,1
2. start any class.,0
3. proceed to answering all but the last question.,0
4. answer last question as midnight rolls over.,0
"actual result: streak freeze did not prevent loss of streak, remained unused and streak reset to 1 day.",0
expected result: streak freeze freezes the streak accordingly and completion past midnight adds one day to current streak instead of resetting to 1 day streak with streak freeze remaining unused.,0
i liked it up until i lost all my xp points.,1
"i worked really hard to get up to nearly 2000, then all of a sudden i go down to 29..wth?!",1
i was #1 then i went down to 29th when i clearly was beating the person who was in the new #1 spot.,1
i almost wanted to quit.,0
"apparently i was supposed to go into a new league but when i checked, i was still in the same one.",1
i'm beyond pissed!,0
"lessons loading slowly, lagging, lacks of pronunciations after a lesson and the subscription button (i was forced to post to be subscribed and attacked by a moderator, thus 1 star), the ""can't listen/talk"" button is placed in a very inconvenient position and causes disabling lessons by accident; the app doesn't have stories and the forum, inability to disable the word bank.. and now duo leaves regardless of what settings say, no motivational messages, he just abandons you after few lessons.",1
lost my streak even though i had a streak freeze on.,1
had to waste my free trial to get it back.,0
i was saving it until i had time to use it.,0
if it happens again i'll probably uninstall and find a different app.,0
"i signed up to do the trial of duolingo plus, i used it once or twice but, it's within 2 weeks of the first payment being taken, i haven't done anything with the account and i can't claim a refund... what happened to the consumer cooling off period?",1
this is not cool...,0
how many times do i have to do the same exercise for it to count my experience and streak ?,1
it's so annoying when it gets like this and it isn't the first time.,0
this app is supposed to save time so why i am wasting mine trying to keep a streak because the app is glitchy ?,0
it was a five star app until it burned me for a 536 day streak even with a streak freeze in place.,1
the owl did the same thing to my wife 6 months later.,0
burned her for a 675 day streak with a streak freeze in place.,1
they must not want people using the free app.,0
"the owl said tagalog would be released over a year ago, yet still nothing, but klingon is there.",1
my wife taught at university and volunteered to be a contributor for english for tagalog speakers but she was totally ignored.,0
"i placed 8th in the gold league and was supposed to move up to the sapphire league, but i'm still in the gold league.",1
i tried to submit feedback but its having issues.,1
otherwise it would be 5 stars.,0
might be useful as a side exercise if you study.,0
but it'll is bad when it comes to basic grammar.,1
it doesn't teach it but expect you to know how to write it.,1
just a simple self study would be a big improvement.,0
this makes learning a guessing game and that suck badly.,0
willl most likely uninstall.,0
does not track streaks correctly.,1
no obvious way to report bugs.,1
progression is at times confusing.,0
no obvious way to provide accents to letters.,1
new update with hearts is a heckin terrible.,1
"you can't learn day-to-day without buying premium because there are not enough hearts, and you have to do exercise to obtain hearts which leads to nothing, just another repeated sequence.",1
"one missed comma in sentence and you have to repeat it again and again, it's irritating",1
this had the offline feature before plus there wasnt any limitations for learning.,0
this was free before.,1
of course yes we are going to make mistakes often so no 5 hearts isnt enough.,0
please make this available offline,1
worked for about 5 minutes.,0
"now it doesn't load at all, or constantly has a message that there's no connection regardless of whether i'm on wifi or using data.",1
the new hearts system makes it unusable and removes the lighthearted learning experience.,1
now i look up much more in order to not lose - and do less lessons (and watch less ads).,0
previously it was 5* app,0
the heart system is useless.,1
really they just want you to pay for the app.,1
"wasn' t that convinced by it, but now i am blocked as i don't have any hearts, i'll look at other ways to learn.",1
who can learn a language and make only 5 mistakes.... please be honest duolingo..you are now a pay for app.,1
the app is pretty broken.,0
can't get past the placement test selection screen.,0
"can't sign in, create a new account, or connect with friends.",1
basically unusable.,0
i have given right answers but it showing it as wrong answer.,0
the study got stucked i have seen no option to skip or to go forward.. and there is no option in the to report the problem.,1
"using from last more than 20 days, but now sometimes shows ""no internet connection "" &i lost all recent work, after uninstalling again download but after use of sometime again shows connection problem.",1
pathetic,0
the update is not good.,0
"fix the new 5 hearts per lesson, please.",1
it results in me using your app much less.,0
your advertisers would probably prefer that i use your app more as opposed to less.,0
the lessons load forever regardless of network quality and audio is missing half of the time.,1
"surely, this can be fixed instead of ""changing how daily streaks work""?",1
"used to be great app before monetization changes, now it is not fun and not free.",0
"also, all updates i've seen in last year made app look worse.",0
it's a good app.,0
but now they've introduced a lot of storys that are full of lgbt content.,0
"i do respect the sexual options of the people, but i believed that this app it's to learn languages.",0
need focus!,0
"the playback from the sentences fails to speak out the whole sentence, it only outputs the last words.",1
i need to click on the speaker button to hear them completely.,1
i can't change my profile picture.,1
i tried several times.,0
"it always says ""an error occurred.",0
"try again later"".",0
this is so frustrating.,0
i just want to change my profile picture.,1
please help.,0
"at the new version it doesn't say the word or phrases, why?",1
"several time i unistall and install this app again, but it doesn't workâ˜¹",0
they just deleted streak freeze without warning and i lost almost 90 days.,1
very disheartening.,0
should switch back to memrise.,0
very bad quality of translation to russian.,1
translations with the same meaning are marked is incorrect.,0
the previous version was much better,0
"is there a reason that there is ""health""?",1
why is this treated as a game?,1
"i am learning a new language because i need to, this is not a game to me.",0
"and why am i learning how to say ""i eat bread"" in spanish rather than learning how to have a basic conversation with someone?",0
"trying to report a bug on the app and it doesn't let me, which is apparently another bug.",1
extremely irritating.,0
"sneaky ""free"", as soon as you run out of ""hearts"" they force you to wait or buy more.",1
just like any other freemium app on existence.,0
do not buy this app!!,0
still waiting for my refund app completely broken!,0
months without being able to use it.,0
"constantly states ""check your internet connection"" despite being connected 3g or wifi.",1
won't download lessons in advance either.,1
paid for a 2 year subscription but can't even use it.,1
kept emailing support without response until they replied to tell me my google pixel 2 isn't supported and to buy another phone!,1
do not buy this app guys.,0
do not give these thieves your money.,0
refund me!,0
"since the update, the app asks for a url login code.",1
i don't have one because i purchased the app with my hard earned cash.,0
i told the company this but they just ignored me.,0
"as a result, i can't get into the app.",0
"this is poor customer service, and i will seek to have my money returned to me",0
if i could rate this 0 stars i would.,0
it is the most absolute irritating thing i have ever dealt with.,0
this is a very vague app and it will expect you to know a whole bunch of spanish words that you have never practice and expect your do them perfectly.,0
for anyone who is thinking of downloading this app never do so don't waste your money or time.,0
it is more expensive than it is worth i would rather have just got babel but sadly now i don't have a choice.,1
very frustrating.,0
it locked me out after using it only 2 months saying it was on another account.,1
i spent a lot of time trying to contact the right people.,0
"after they charged me again for another $50,i still can't use it again.",1
please help me.,0
"this app isn't engaging enough, i found it boring and slow and it didn't teach me anything.",1
something like duolingo is much better for anyone who wants to learn a language.,0
app keeps telling me sign-in failed.,1
something went wrong.,0
"when i attempted to contact support, chat doesnt work either.",1
i can't even log in.,1
ive tried multiple times and it keeps saying something went wrong,0
"application tried to remove money from my account without my knowledge, she wanted to pay 3 months of english even though i didn't even log in to create a profile on that application, so i do not recommend this application, beware of fraud",1
app is not opening i tried it on my phone as well as on my friend's phone but its not opening.,1
"can't see the pictures, navigation not intuitive.",1
please contact me to ensure i will not be charged for this.,0
this app is the pinnacle of incompetent.,0
"for one, there's no option for a placement text for non-beginners.",0
"which wouldn't be a huge problem, if it wasn't for the fact that going through the lessons is so unnessacarily tedious because of the pointless, slow-ass fade transitions and the decision to force you to listen to each entire sentence before answering.",0
"duolingo is infinitely better, not to mention free.",0
same thing: only works while online.,0
what's the point: keeping people on a tight leash ?,0
well...i got really excited when i saw that there is a rosetta stone app...even more excited when i got the apl and my user info worked to link to my past p.c.,0
progress....did one lesson and now i have to buy more to unlock?,0
how is it linked to the one i already bought but not enough that i can use it on the app more than 1 lesson worth?,0
disappointing,0
it's horrible.,0
"i tried to use this app to further my study in the japanese language, but it seems that there is no beginner course.",1
"i chose the lowest level course it has, but not not only did it start teaching me words from the beginning, those words were mainly written in kanji, which i barely know anything about.",0
and it didnt even give a translation either!,0
it just showed pictures.,0
pictures!!,0
how the hell am i supposed to figure out what the words that i cant read with just pictures?,1
!,0
horrible.,0
impossible to learn from.,0
the program has the student repeat a russian word or phrase and gives only a picture for the description.,1
but a picture is worth a thousand words.,0
there is too much ambiguity.,0
"even if you can repeat the word or phrase, you dont know what it means.",0
its way too fustrating.,0
thank god i didnt spend a ton of money on this.,0
"i opted for the free trial, and they immediately charged my card $49.",1
i immediately cancelled the subscription but did not get a refund!!,0
instead they will cancel it in december and keep my money!!,0
"i cant comment on the actual value of the app, because i feel scammed and will be using another subscription app instead that gave me a 7day free trial ( and i am now happy to pay for) beware!!",0
!,0
i want to like this app so much but honestly how am i expected to learn a new language if you just tell me to say things with no explanations at all?,1
i get not using english but so far rs has taught me nothing but random words with no real in-depth learning of the grammar.,1
i read the generic reply but when people are telling you it's not working you should take that advice and alter the program.,0
"paid full price to have full access to the language learning lessons, but the subscription was not added to my account and i received error messages when trying to use the software.",1
i sent six emails to the customer support and only received one reply asking for proof of purchase.,1
"i immediately replied with proof of purchase, and then no further email correspondence from rosetta stone.",0
i finally looked up the us phone number for technical assistance and had to call 3 times.,0
only on the third call when i requested a refund was my issue was finally escalated and resolved in 30 minutes.,0
the subscription was added to my account.,0
a simple issue should not take so long and be so frustrating to fix.,0
this took over a week and nearly an hour calling internationally.,0
good luck if you ever experience a real technical issue.,0
the customer support is terrible.,1
"they asked me questions like ""why did you buy it through the play store?",0
"you should have bought it on our website"" well the app takes you to the play store to complete the purchase.",0
edit: latest version introduces display error.,0
i have speaking and listening focus.,0
in overview it shows me that there are 33 lessons per unit.,0
(but i'm the unit bottom it says 32 out of 32) please add dark mode.,1
"the app is so white, learning at night is very tedious on the eyes.",1
:(,0
"it's pretty expensive for me, make it free, put some adds, i'll never complain about it.",1
"was trapped by misleading ad for ""free"" trial.",1
they charged for 3 months even though i canceled immediately they kept my money.,1
they are crooked.,0
total garbage.,0
much better free apps out there.,0
don't let them sucker you out of $60 like they did me.,0
outdated.,0
this is terrible!,0
you have to pay to do it!,0
"i'm sure that the actual app is good, but i'm not wasting my money.",0
getting prompted to review it about every 10 minutes- even after doing a review!!,0
!,0
"the app is great for learning, and i really wanna learn more but when i press on purchase all lessons, the page for paying doesn't appear.",1
speech recognition is horrible.,0
i have rosetta stone on my computer and it is perfectly fine.,1
the android app is trash by comparison and not worth the obscene subscription cost.,1
i tried to use it during my morning commute and find that i rarely get a response from the app when doing pronunciation.,1
you have to scream to get a response.,1
i've tried it on my iphone as well and it's the same there.,0
"don't waste your money here, wait for a slickdeals sale and buy the pc version for a one-time fee.",1
"the app was great, brilliant for learning especially if you have experience already in what you're learning.",0
"but it updated 2 weeks ago and has since not worked, coming up with an error message whenever i click on a module.",1
i have contacted the support team twice with regards to it and they are yet to respond with anything more than an email giving me a case number.,1
unprofessional and currently just bleeding my bank account for nothing.,1
do.,0
not buy.,0
"they say 30-day guaranteed refund, so i decide to buy the unlimited use japanese version on march 2nd, but i quickly decide (the following day) to cancel it and get it refunded, but, i can't!",1
"because i bought it through google play, i can't get a refund (i tried all the steps they provide, and nothing, google keeps automatically denying my request).",1
"if you hesitate with your purchase on google play, you'll get scr*wed over.",1
do not buy!,0
!,0
signed up to the 3 day free trial.,0
figured it'd give me a chance to see if i got on with it then i could subscribe after next payday.,0
"2 hours after signing up, 29.99 gets pulled out of my bank even though i cancelled as i was aware of auto renew after 3 days.",1
my play store app is not letting me request a refund (option isn't there?).,1
"when i contacted rosetta, they just gave me a link to their app faqs which had nothing to do with refunds.",1
didn't care that my money has been taken for a free trial,1
signed me out and won't let me sign back in.,1
i have a paid subscription.,0
update.,0
"i'm now cancelling my subscription after not being able to resolve the issue through customer support, but it's not giving me the option for a return if my funds.",1
i'll be contacting my bank tomorrow to have them reverse the payments.,0
"while i get the way you are trying to teach, you still need to add a translation or something to tell the user what they are learning, in the demo for japanese there's 1 question that has no rhyme or reason for why its structured the way it is, you literally have to guess, all 4 pictures it showed had nothing i could see to do with each other, and the fill in the blank it gave had no explanation why it went where it did.",1
atleast tell us what we are trying to learn so we don't get stuck.,0
the app is ok but i had to guess the correct answer because it isn't explained what the actual meaning of it is.,1
it also sucks that you have to buy the other lessons like why :/,0
i was excited to start because i really wanted to learn to speak swedish and thought i'd give this a shot.,0
"but the app has me saying things but it does not tell me exactly what i was saying, just pictures that i have to guess.",1
this is an inadequate way of learning.,0
i'm very upset with this.,0
definitely will not be purchasing the full version.,0
"the app will ask if you are a beginner, intermediate or advanced, but you cannot open any intermediate lesson without buying them, so the only way to try the app is to start with the very basics, 'hello and goodbye'.",1
not buying without trying.,1
"only the application is free, but content is paid.",1
this should be clear in the description.,1
play store and apple app store are to be blamed for allowing this.,0
"it wastes the user time ilstalling an application because of wrong, misleading or incomplete information.",1
okay this is really a disguised rip-off.,0
a bait and switch.,0
i do not recommend it for the price.,1
you think you're getting a lot for the money.,0
but you find out unlimited is limited real quick.,1
limited to try to get you to fork over more money.,1
i want to give it 5 stars honestly it helped me learn spanish... but it also kept charging me $25 a month without my knowledge!,1
"what is even worse is they charge you before they say they will, my subscription was apparently supposed to renew on the 11th but i was charged a day early on the 10th and they refuse to refund anything.",1
do not pay for this app!!!,0
this is essentially a scam :(,0
"great program, but the subscription and app are impossible!",0
keeps locking me out of the modules.,1
"considering going back to duolingo.. not wuite as good of a language program, but for a free program, the user experience is way better!",0
"i don't know what's happen, but when i want to sign up, it say my email have been used before.",0
"then, i try to sign in, and i can't too.",0
"but i never use this app before, how can it say that my email have already used.",1
can you help me?,0
it will not let me log in or make a free account i have tried everything and still won't work.,1
i know i have one because i have used it before and it says that there is a problem with the account.,0
do not buy this learning software!,0
go with babble.,0
i talked to an agent prior to buying i bought the cds and explained i wanted mobile and home use of the cds.,0
i was told that you then have to pay again for their online service to use your purchased expensive language cds on a mobile device!,0
absolutely a waste of money!,0
the cds will not work at all on a chromebook as well.,1
i will make sure to tell everyone i know to not use this product!,0
"i can't help but be really confused it's making me say long sentences out loud on the first day with barely any practice, and it's driving me insane how many times i have to try.",1
money hungry.,1
the company wont give you the mobile languages even though i purchased the desktop versions.,1
"so this app wants me to spend around 1,000 dollars so i can practice both on my desktop and on mobile?",1
that is ridiculous.,0
waste of my money for a 3 months access for $50 when all i get is few core lessons or force to go full access for extra $100-200 so disappointed from this waste of my money and time for basic free trial lessons (but for $50),1
awful app.,0
when i tried a trial period which was suggested in this app it took money from my google account.,1
its first time when i get in such strange circumstanses while using a trial access in education app.,0
never could get the voice phases to work properly.,1
"several attempts, all failures.",0
i called 2 months ago to end my service subscription because the app won't let me under manage subscription.,0
i dont use it anymore and they are still charging me.,1
"yet another booooring subscription app from greedy developers, that don't bother to explain clearly that this is a subscription app, before installing.",1
"awful was a free trial membership that couldn't get off the free trial membership screen online help was no help go with duo lingo, they stand by their product and it's free",0
don't download this app if you are an english speaker looking to learn farsi.,1
"unlike every single free app i've used, this app only provides words in farsi script.. there is no english alphabet lettering to help with pronunciation eg ""salÃ¢m"" for Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù….",0
from course one you are asked to repeat long sentences.,1
"if you can't read farsi, you have to do this purely by audio (listening+repeating) which for many learners isn't possible.",1
i've never been so upset about wasting my money on a subscription.,0
it's not free so couldn't even give it a try.,1
"not giving my credit card for a ""free trial"" just to see if it even works.",0
this app is good in terms of teaching.,0
but it makes you buy 76/80 lessons.,0
only the first 4 are free.,0
i'm trying to lear korean for a trip and this was a huge waste of money.,0
there were no basics to the alphabet.,1
it's like playing russian rullete because it simply throws you into full sentence structure.,0
absolute waste of money.,0
duolingo free app does a better job...,0
the app does not show the translations in english like it says it does and there is no support,1
terrible experience .,0
it's not the right way for a beginner to learn .,1
you can't just say a word over and over and have it written in japanese .,1
.,0
"if  i go to japan and someone  speaks louder and slower , would it make me understand ?",0
or what if they were to point to a sign or some  text .,0

everyone having a cd course paid activation code should be able to create an account and continue to learn using the app,0
"i chose to learn russian, i got a word, had to say it best i could, and depending on how well i say it, i would pass.",0
but it doesn't say what the word means or anything,1
app doesn't work anymore on chromebook.,1
worthless!,0
so disappointing that this app does not offer at least one african language option.,1
swahili is a language spoken widely throughout africa and this is not an option available on the app.,1
you get a free trial period but you have to make a subscription to it.,1
verbal is off on the phone.,1
i have it on my computer and that this would be good too.,0
its not,0
"""sales department"" takes my money and gives me the wrong language and i call 5 minutes later for them to tell me sales department cannot cancel or change orders.",1
"only ""customer service"", which is closed, can change orders.",1
very unprofessional for a top name brand in language learning.,0
no authorization given for charges!,1
it did not show me what i was saying in english but only filipino.,1
i don't understand why you have to pay money to just learn a new language on these appsðŸ˜¡,0
i have the 5 day learning thing for learning a language and it has said for the past three days that i'm done learning for the day as soon as i open the app.,1
and apparently i learned 2 days worth of german on the very first day.,0
i haven't been able to do any of the core lessons because i have to buy them and i personally think that the plans are way too expensive.,1
$50 for only 3 months??,1
this is app is not helpful and i think that google translate does a better job of teaching languages.,0
wont let me cancel my subscription,1
thought it was free...i uninstalled...will my card be billed,1
"terrible , didn't teach me anything just went strait ahead to the hard stuff even though it was on basic.",1
"i signed in, i don't want to use it or get a bill.",0
i can't find a way to remove the account.,1
how to delete the account?,1
this game wouldn't tell me the means of the word so i couldn't find the answer,1
can't cancel same day and get refund.,1
i hate it all you do is say it and don't even learn.,0
