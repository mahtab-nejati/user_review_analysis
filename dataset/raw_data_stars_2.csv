duolingo,2,0,"i got the pp and have been using it all the time. personally thought it was great. about a month in i tried to get my girlfriend to join, but for whatever reason her game uses ""hearts"" where mine uses ""lights"". this difference literally means that she cannot do what i have been doing, which is playing for about 5 minutes each day. the heart system actually stops you from learning and instead blocks you with a pay wall to play their ""free"" pp..."
duolingo,2,10,"spanish: needs to indicate what dialect or country of origin each word comes from. needs much more variety with pronunciation examples. some examples are inaccurate or misleading. needs option for all verbal only exercises, for marketing a specific dialect too. the problem with visual based learning is that one needs visual cubs to remember things - once the cubs are absent (like in realistic conversation), you forget it all. ok for absolute beginners, but not for further learning."
duolingo,2,1,"often doesn't count when you've completed a level. have to take the same lessons over and over before it shows that it's been completed. but if you make a mistake, it will take your hearts. also, you sometimes have to pay twice to refill your hearts. if the pp worked correctly, it would be a five star pp."
duolingo,2,18,"this pp goes in wrong direction. as many people have mentioned, the hearts system discourages learning. besides, the pp lacks many features that the web version has - such as timed practice and ability to type answers instead of selecting them from the tray. i used to be a plus user for several months, but stopped since i don't want to sponsor the changes i don't agree with. now it looks like it's time to install the pp altogether and stick to web. if the gems make it to web too, i'm out."
duolingo,2,7,"it's not horrible when you first start out. it's actually rather easy to learn. however, there are some issues in the later ""levels"". it gets harder, which it should. if you use headphones or earbuds the voice sounds like it is saying one thing but it is trying to say something else. the translations can be rather strange or awkward. the heart system is kind of painless, it's only there to put a block on progress. if you want a good language pp, i suggest paying a subscription to munro."
duolingo,2,11,"only feared towards an american audience, for both spanish and english earners (even the flags are wrong). the same with portuguese. it's very inconsistent when his-tying due to finger errors. however, the biggest problem is there are never any explanations as to why the rule is as it is. you only know if it's right or wrong and have no indication why this is the case. very limited but a decent option to start learning some basic vocabulary for a new language."
duolingo,2,1,"great pp, but there's some issues with the latest versions. i've had up take some courses over again because do somehow hasn't remembered what i've completed. and there's no bug-report feature!?? also, when you get the ""scuffle words"" to complete a sentence, it's no longer possible to rendering words by pulling (andros 10)"
duolingo,2,7,"this pp is pretty much only good for vocabulary. i'm trying to learn a completely new language, and the rules of the language are not being explained. i don't know how to properly read the language, any of the grammar rules, what words to use in each instance, act. i'm not learning the language-- i'm learning neat words and phrases that do me no good w/o understanding. it would be better to give a lesson on the mechanics of the language and then the flash cards to test the skill."
duolingo,2,0,it is very easy for your brain to use process of elimination rather than memorization. clot better learning if you write along and keep the audit off and switch your keyboard to the native language. do not except to learn here without daily use of the pp and writing outside of it. this is my experience but when i am done i usually can't remember much of it or it is mixed up. (i am mainly referring to japanese and learning hiragana) this would be much better if it included a writing exercise.
duolingo,2,9,"i honestly liked the older version better. i hate the heart system, i only get 5 mistakes and i really don't want to pay. i'm learning french for school and it's really hard to when i only have 5 mistakes. it would be 5 stars if there was no heart system, i get that they need people to pay but i like it when there was no heart system."
duolingo,2,50,"this pp is very educational and helped me a lot with my languages ( learning spanish). however, i am not impressed more than i am disappointed. if you answer a question wrong, it takes away a heart and you only have 5 and if you run out you either have to wait or pay money to have unlimited hearts and the time for waiting is a couple of days. how are you supposed to learn if you can even try? i am very mad about the limit."
duolingo,2,6,"have been using the pp to learn japanese for over 40 days straight. however, i am unable to move on because i keep running out of hearts (i.e. lives) for supposed errors, when i have the exact answer as the ""correction"". i have reported the errors to no resolve. so now i am frustrated and will be meeting the pp. i definitely do not have time for this..."
duolingo,2,6,this new heart thing doesn't work. i got answers that are right but lose hearts regardless. i get penalized for minor spelling errors. and on top of that i need gems to refill those hearts. how long does it take to refill those gems. this doesn't help learning. it might help you get more subscribers but whatever. learning has turned from something fun to a stupid grind to refill my hearts.
duolingo,2,2,"it's fine for those who have never studied a language before. for advanced earners it's a joke, particularly with all of the technical stitches. it's impossible to move to new levels because the program translated wrong. also, while i can move ahead in progress, it has stopped registering my advances. i get no record of my status."
duolingo,2,11,enjoyed the pp until they did an upgrade or reaped it. i had made it through all the levels. after the change i was essentially sent back to beginning and my progress was erased. i am not a beginner. i've spent a year trying to regain some advanced status again but pp keeps having me spend all my time on doing lessons that i've mixed out in. ridiculous. at this rate it will take 3-4 years to make any significant progress again. definitely thumbs down. it should encourage not discourage.
duolingo,2,14,"i enjoy learning japanese with this pp, the community is great, they give tips and tricks to understand the lessons easily, but i just have this issue in the leaderboard and achievements. i have already finished first in the leaderboard twice, in the ruby and emerald league, but i wasn't able to receive any rewards or even accomplished the 'winner' or even the 'champion' in the achievements tax. this is very frustration, i have lost my motivation to compete anymore please fix this."
duolingo,2,0,"have been using this pp for couple of months now. it seems very promising at first but with time once you get past the very basis it starts to get very long and challenging without any real system of teaching i find myself memorizing correct answers in stead of learning the language. this system i feel like is more focused on creating an impression of progress but lacking any practical teaching, testing of knowledge. this will work only as a complimentary pp to real courses."
duolingo,2,25,"the health system sucks a lot. it does not encourage attempting different ways to phrase sentences, and punishes me for trying to do more exercises a day. for all this talk about ""keeping education free"", it really pushes the premium/played account status. also the network is hideous beyond description and adds nothing but clatter to the experience. i lastly prefer the web version over this mess. i only keep this on my phone for doing last-minute exercises to save me streak."
duolingo,2,4,"the pp principally works, but it does not include the explanations the web pp offers (the tips section for each lesson explaining background). without that it's often hard to follow. also often there is an error when trying to access the forum for a given phrase. together with domingo often claiming an answer is right, even though there are spelling mistakes (and not pointing them out), this pretty much means you constantly need a second pp to verify the spelling is actually correct."
duolingo,2,3,"i would give 5 stars, but sadly i can't. quite a few bags i guess: like not accepting the right answer and having a whole bunch of points (450) wiped, so not only did i lose my hearts, i lost all my progress & hardware:( & my place in the leader boards. really disheartening. it's such a good system otherwise. please can you sort this?"
duolingo,2,0,domingo was a little rocky at first when learning japanese and i still dont agree with some of its training. however european languages ended up being perfect for the type of training structure they have and gave it a 3 out of 5. the real problem with the pp came when i convinced friends to download it and they were given a form of the pp that try's to force you to upgrade to premium with hearts. it ruined the experience and they installed it.
duolingo,2,0,"normally, i'd rate it 5 stars! however, they've apparently decided to remove the tips section of the german course, which i'm currently doing! well, that wrecked it for me! the tips were really useful! i've decided to stop using the pp for this reason!!"
duolingo,2,0,"you completely removed the motivation to reach your daily goal since you can now maintain your streak by completing a single lesson. also, this pp could really use some states like time spent learning or words learnt (they even sometimes tell you in random email). edit: also, it is 2020, get a dark mode :("
duolingo,2,0,doing japanese course in introduction and it is extremely frustration when using you/natasha no name wa madura hand desk. when using 'desk' in the sentence it is purely at random of and can get me to lose a hearts. it feels more like luck instead of learning. please fix as this feels like an intentional feature to buy premium membership which goes against your motor if free learning.
duolingo,2,1,"it seems like a good pp. alas, i was asked to ""create a profile"" before i could progress past the basic lessons. also, no way to turn off modifications(probably locked behind account creation). the heart system is trash. shame really."
duolingo,2,0,"i really did love this pp but there is a bug in it that means it keeps easing my progress so i can't clock and continue on to more difficult lessons, effectively making the pp useless. i hope they fix this soon cause otherwise i would've given it 5 stars."
duolingo,2,0,this is really good pp....but there are some faults that need to be checked immediately....in hind n english words watching section there are some words that are correctly matched but the answer will show wrong...eg for word hate correct answer is narrate carta run...but answer will show that it is wrong....hence we cannot move to next page until all answers are correct....so there is no other option but to leave the page....ply solve this issue...other words are cats n billion...
duolingo,2,1,"i dont know about other languages, but this pp is bad at teaching japanese. i am learning japanese and am a beginner (i dont know hiragana or any japanese words). domingo at times shows me a random word in english, and gives me 3 choice to choose from (written in hiragana). example: the word is ""pencil"", which i have never heard in japanese before, meaning i wont know how its spelled in hiragana either. the pp forces me to guess, and when i'm wrong, i lose a heart and can learn anymore."
duolingo,2,1,"what do you do when you pass levels but the pp doesn process your progress. its like frozen i keep going trough the lessons without mistakes and give done 5 lessons even progressed to the next level but the pp says give only done 2 out of 8 lessons ?? any solutions for that, rather than that been working perfectly so far, but what currently happening is rather annoying"
duolingo,2,0,"hearts didn't properly regenerate, answers had duplicates solutions that would cause you to lose hearts, closing an ad would lead to getting domingo plus every time, and there are better methods of teaching languages. domingo doesn't have a good structure for reviewing words."
duolingo,2,19,"used to be a wonderful pp to get people learning new languages without spending a fortune or having to go to classes in busy lifestyle. however the new heart system is a massive failure. how can you expect to learn a language and only make 5 mistakes? why not just put another ad in after every lesson if you really need more money. 5 star pp if it wasn't for the heart system, whoever thought of that wants firing"
duolingo,2,0,the pp is great but all of a sudden it shows i'm office and won't load content. my internet connection is good and everything else on my phone is sanctioning properly.
duolingo,2,1,"domingo is a great pp don't get me wrong but, i absolutely hate the heart system please i really need to learn japanese so can you just please remove the heart system you could keep the ad you could keep the how you use it please no more hearts."
duolingo,2,1,"just about the time you get on a roll, you run out of hearts and have to wait to get back to the lessons. it's very frustration and obviously a play to make people pay a monthly fee for the ""free"" pp."
duolingo,2,0,i've been using this pp about a year. i used to get lessons where it would have you repeat sentences. i no longer get those. and every day three lessons i've already completed need to be restored. i have not been able to move past where i am because i always have to restore what i've already finished. it's annoying
duolingo,2,0,"not terrible, but they made some changes recently that really detracted from the user experience and despite two email providing feedback and seeking a response over the past 6 months, i've heard nothing back as to why."
duolingo,2,1,"before the update this would be 5 star -you shouldn't have stars, mistakes are part of learning -premium is dumb and expensive -i don't like the new gem thing either everything else is fine but because of these three things i don't like it anymore"
duolingo,2,0,"the sound doesn work,when i want to translate the lines and write it the speed is very very very low,the old previous version was really really better than this one,in not satisfied with this,unfortunately"
duolingo,2,0,it was a awesome pp at the beginning but the sound has stopped since i started italian. i tried every way to fix it but didn't answer. so i will never use this pp anymore.
duolingo,2,1,"as that i can't say ""no thank you"" come regularly and i have to install them to get any more lesson. frustration! otherwise the program is excellent!"
duolingo,2,3,it's a good pp but it's rather throttle with the hearts system - it makes quite frustration to use the pp. they claim it's designed to help with learning but it is clearly designed to incentive you to pay
duolingo,2,0,"i liked this pp, at least at first. the owl is cut, the lessons were fun, and i learned a lot of spanish. but .. apparently when i first made my account, i had enabled some privacy settings that restricted my access to some cool features. when i went in to change this, it twitched and wouldn't let me. so now i can't do these cool things on do, and it's really frustration. also it loads really slowly, and everything you can buy in the 'store' is worthless. i haven't loved this pp."
duolingo,2,1,"the first rounds of lessons are good but as you get further into the lessons the answers are unclear. for example in the first rounds you are taught that ""how are you"" translated to ""come vestas"" later on when asked to translate ""how are you"" it does not give these option and says it is ""come le va te used"" there is no explanation provided..."
duolingo,2,0,"i am very disappointed in the pp for andros. the plus version has been stuck for two days. on the tying translation test, it gets stuck."
duolingo,2,0,"uses your data to download content for office without permission and there is no way to shut it off or undo it without buying the pp. it will always store data office for the 7 day free trial, even if you reject the offer. if you buy the pp, the option to turn off autodownload is under settings. this option to turn it off isn available on the free pp. i really like the pp but it has many issues like this and customer service is almost nonexistent, which is why i will not pay for it."
duolingo,2,0,"i really like the pp. however, several of my achievements haven't updated, and their support team never followed up about it. that was a disappointing experience."
duolingo,2,0,"come on! you cut off the option for regenerate hearts! now are 4 hearts! i know the office option isn't free but please domingo, you guns where doing it right."
duolingo,2,0,"the audit play back simply doesn't work for me, no idea why but it's broken."
duolingo,2,0,used for a while but one section where you fill in the banks stitches. can't see the word bubbles at the bottom. so can't move forward.
duolingo,2,0,"good pp, really enjoying learning french but all my hearts keep disappearing for no reason and then i can't continue. i would pay for domingo plus if it weren't so expensive."
duolingo,2,0,i am using this pp for i think a year and i have learned quite many words. sons: they made skin skill after level 0 to paid. very inappropriate as.
duolingo,2,10,good pp it really could've been a 5 star if it wasn't for the awful heart system. it takes the fun away from learning and penalizing someone for making a mistake is not a good teaching method. i used to use it a lot but nowadays because i keep making mistakes i'm not able to learn it as much as i used to. the training is boring of so i decided to not just use the pp and wait and awfully long time to get 1 stupid god damn heart. please remove this awful feature.
duolingo,2,2,"the pp is definitely beneficial, and i learned the languages very easily. my only problem i had was sometimes when you had to choose a word that matches another, i'd try to tap the word but it would disappear and i'd get the question wrong. it's a great pp overall, but my rating won't change until the bug does."
duolingo,2,3,"the heart system ruined it. ever since they implements the heart system, this pp is pay to progress, despite it being heavily advertisement tormented to ""keep learning free"". they have definitely gone back on that for a full, max profits model. learning a new language is about making mistakes and learning from them. since the heart system you are only allowed five mistakes per lesson or you have to pay the in pp currency to refill your hearts. i haven't progressed since this change."
duolingo,2,8,"i download the pp to start learning chinese, and maybe start another language as well. things were going fine until i decided to start hind. it started off by prompting you select the towel sound you hear, the big problem being that it doesn't sound out the towel when select an option, and being new to hind i don't know the difference between ī and i, so i was left guessing. i wouldn't be complaining if i'd made a genuine mistake, or i didn't have to wait forever for my hearts to refill."
duolingo,2,0,"i liked it, but when me and my mon created a profile, it took forever to load and it made us create a profile a second time!"
duolingo,2,2,i liked it better before because just because you get 5 answers wrong you have to wait! which isn't fair because what if you have to study for a test in another language? if you get a few answers wrong you may or may not fail that test. i guess it's an okay pp for like smart people but not for beginners like me so beginners get a different pp this isn't for you (or me).
duolingo,2,0,"it is good and was good, but the hearts feature, which i didn't have on my old account that i quit the day i switched, is horrible."
duolingo,2,0,"ok, been using it for a few days, trying to zip thou tests since i do have an intermediate knowledge of the language i choose (italian). pro: does meet the basis, it seems. con: - won't scale/render in landscape mode - silly repeated phrases such as ""the men write in the sugar""! senseless phrases. eat sugar is used too, too many times, very silly and irritating - unable to use pp on andros 9 when font size and display size are set to near max, missing lines and phrases, unable to ch"
duolingo,2,5,i really love this pp but the recent update is awful. you now need to pay lights to test out of a level. that is really infuriating for people who want/can to progress fast. update (30-dec-2019): it is now the second time that i open my domingo on a monday morning to find that my streak freeze was used up even though i had a weekend amulet. this is clearly a new recent bug
duolingo,2,87,"while this pp does teach you languages, it is also forcing you to grind the same lessons over and over for too long, recently they have made it even longer - unless you pay for the subscription. this is especially bad for users already with a decent proficient in the language who are forced to repeat the same low level lessons with a limited number of ships. this can be a language started but if you are wanting a better return on time spent, look elsewhere. for free, it's okay."
duolingo,2,8,"remove button that disabled listening exercises. i keep accidentally tapping it while playing, forcing me to exit and mentally flick it back on in settings. screen rotation/slipping does not work on my galaxy tax a. another thing that irritated me: the dumbly at the bottom right corner, which, lets you practice all skill simultaneously; the problem is that it gives me questions that i have not seen yet because once you get level 1 in a skill it unlocked the lower ones and those are these."
duolingo,2,18,"i loved the pp! but the last update is really not pleasant! i can't take anymore a placement test when doing another course. then you can't delete a course, i mean that if you took one course for english speaker, you cannot delete it if it's the only one, even having a lot more for french speaker, so you're king of getting lost with courses for different language speaker, i wanted to try but i don't like and i can't remove it. also why did you stop to offer ""free test"" .... please do something"
duolingo,2,0,keeps disconcerting and saying there's no internet connection - in on hyperoptic internet with 1 meg bits per second...!
duolingo,2,6,"tried to learn hind.. and i noticed problems, such as different bowels sound exactly the same, there no distinction at all, and sense it's just a guess which one to choose, most like leading to making mistake. also, i couldn't complete several tasks due to the pp not accepting the correct answer. and the last, it doesn't have any grammar notes or explanation, so it's really like running in the fields with no direction"
duolingo,2,0,recent changes have badly damaged the experience - it's very hard to see what you need to review and revise in a comprehensive and efficient way.
duolingo,2,23,"game is different across users -- my husband download it (not the plus ver) and was enjoying it, so i wanted to try. i download it as well, but mine is different! we both get as, but i also have hearts, which i lose with each mistake (or even a his-click). you don't get special benefits with hearts, you just can't play without them. hearts take a long while to regenerate--this impedes learning pace, and i don't want to pay for plus when my husband has these features free."
duolingo,2,78,"i used domingo for over a year and loved it, as didn't bother me, but i really don't like the heart system with the new update. language learning is by making mistakes and it's not the same as a game. i guess it's fair that domingo wants pp to pay, but it's annoying after year(s) of it. should have made some additional features as paying."
duolingo,2,1,"there's a problem with singing information on the domingo pp on mobile devices and on the domingo on the computer. i practiced on my computer, but it didn't reflect on my phone. i lost a 161 day streak because of that! i'm very upset about this. also why is there different lesson information on the domingo on pus? it's very confusing."
duolingo,2,6,"i used to love this pp and progressed rapidly, but then they started using the heart health and penalizing me for mistakes on new lessons. mistakes are a big part of learning (even do says so! ) and i've been extremely frustrated with the hearts and having to quit a lesson towards the end because i ran out of hearts. please go back to lights and no hearts!!!! i tried to use the online version, which doesn't have the hearts, but it's hard to use on a mobile devise. ply discontinue the hearts!!"
duolingo,2,18,"i use to have the premium version. but i stopped using it as much. going back to the free version is almost unable. it locks up. i have a fixed 2. but it seems like the attempt to get data in real time and the requirements of the new i, make the pp freeze up continuously. i think the testes just download all the data(pro). and never deal with the pain."
duolingo,2,12,"i am trying russian and i found it very frustration that the initial section labelled ""alphabet"" actually did not teach the alphabet! i'm wondering if there is an error in the pp and that section is mislabeled. i've had to teach myself the alphabet elsewhere. also, some of the other languages have grammar lessons that you can read to help understand the language better but so far russian doesn't have that option. otherwise the lessons are fun and interactive, although the vocabulary is a bit odd"
duolingo,2,21,"great application would it be if you changed these two things in it. there are a lot of mistakes in accents and intonations in languages (especially in russian language), that are not changed, however, they were marked as incorrect. i like reading stories, though i find it really offensive to read the dialogue #6 (in taxi). please, either change the topic or let people read next stories without it, because i can not reach next chapter. looking forward to updated! thank you for attention!"
duolingo,2,3,"ok so i've been using this pp for years and it's always been helpful but the update is such a downgrade, i live in an area where phone signal and wife are spot so i used to download the lessons and do them office, but now i apparently have to pay $12.99 monthly??? also you can't see all the lessons in a group ( ex you used to click on ""basis"" and it would show you what you were donna learn in every lesson) and the progress quires used to be free so you could skin things you already knew.."
duolingo,2,18,"i find the pp very clung. i've lost lives because i have selected words which haven't gone up to the sentence. it also doesn't teach words before testing us on them. i have just lost a life even though i got an answer right (checked with a welsh person). all in all, i'm getting p*used off. i haven't learned anything new after living in wales for 6 years"
duolingo,2,6,"it worked fine when learning welsh, but for german it kept saying my answer was wrong when it was identical to that of the correct answer. not only did it take away all of my hearts and force me to stop but when i went to purchase more hearts it took my gems and gave nothing back. the pp clearly has a lot of bags that needs fixing but the idea of the pp is still good. it is just currently unable for me."
duolingo,2,7,"i was really loving this pp until the f@$*ing hearts system started on my andros phone. now, you get punished for mistakes, even genuine types or background sounds that mess with your spoken attempts. i don't think treating the learning experience like a game of candy crush is very helpful. i get anxious as i lose hearts, and tend to look up answers on goose which is making the process slower and much less fun."
duolingo,2,31,"it's a pretty good pp, but have a lot of mistakes in the answers and the users complaints/reports are not taken in any care. it is very annoying lose ""life"" because of some wrong translation in the pp, but it's even more when you report it and nothing happens. the developer don't care to use the user's free help to improve their product. it is a good pp for beginners, that's all"
duolingo,2,22,"after the latest update i am a regular user, and this update has demotivated me, we should be able to make mistakes, the hearts system is just not right. also, my pp is showing gems instead of lights now, just because i use it on my pad too. i don't understand what's going on. this pp used to be so great, how am i going to do multiple lessons in a day now?"
duolingo,2,1,today domingo seems to be broken. it is refusing to recognise the nodules i have done despite me being online :/
duolingo,2,99,"i was having a good time with this pp for a while, until one day it just random stopped working. i had an 18 day streak but suddenly the lessons would not load. it would say ""an error occurred"" at the top. tried installing and uninstalling. now it will not even log me in. frustration but it is whatever, i suppose. also, i hate how a small little type can ruin the health bar. it is so annoying."
duolingo,2,21,"domingo was an amazing pp, would've given it 5 stars a couple months ago. but the latest updated do not promote language learning like they used too. it's like they took away everything that made this pp work. i used to actually retain information with this repetition practices and high daily goals. now goals mean nothing and lessons are short and not memorable. would even pay for those features in the future. right now i want to abandon it."
duolingo,2,25,"i was enjoying this pp until they decided to change the way it works. you no longer can learn at your own pace because they've changed it to a life-based video game style system. i don't know anyone who learns new content in less than five tries. it disrupt the flow because you can no longer move forward and have to wait for these lives to regenerate. either you want to teach and have content stick, or you want to be a game."
duolingo,2,3,the pp is great for learning at your own pace but since the hearts were added the pp isn't enjoyable anymore. you'll only be able to get things wrong 5 times before you're not able to learn anymore and you have to wait for hours to get more hearts to be able to play again. this is very frustration to me. especially if you are struggling with something. it doesn't help. please get rid of it.
duolingo,2,0,to be improved - pp and customer service. trying to learn russian again and the pp is struggling with the transliteration of russian to english and vis versa. i have remained repeatedly about advise on this as i am stuck at the lowest level on the pp. not 1 reply to my email. hence canceled the subscription and requesting a refund of the 6 months worth paid for in advance.
duolingo,2,10,"honestly, i really like domingo. i've been using it for french and japanese and it's pretty been great (though only when supplemented by other learning). my biggest complaint is that they do tons of changes to the way their reward incentive work, and it differs by platform, and sometimes from week to week. it's kind frustration how inconsistent they are at times. i just want them to pick something and stick to it for more than a month."
duolingo,2,0,doesn't help when the answer you are trying to press is hidden under the continue button and the program goes into loop asking you the same question - which you can't answer!!!
duolingo,2,1,thank you for fixing the problem! so far i love this pp! in learning french and it's really easy! edit: ok i still love the pp but the whole 5 lives and having to get gems to pay them is stupid. i mean really?! i get a few answers wrong and boom all progress lost and have to wait. i'll bring my review when you fix this. 😠
duolingo,2,0,"a bit limited (especially in greek!), but the spanish lessons are very good. wish the slow option was given on each question. also would really like the tip option for greek!! (11/2019 degraded):i really hate the update that disregard learning in place of making it easier to earn crowns(ratification)! you now complete 4 lessons to earn a crown. i have a ton of crowns, but haven't learned much! i felt like i was achieving something before, but now i feel like this pp is only a game!"
duolingo,2,0,"was a 5 star pp when it actually allowed you to practice. if you make a certain amount of mistakes it will not let you keep taking lessons. forces you to pay for ""lives""/ pay for their subscription or to wait over 4 hours to get more attempts. not free and stops people from learning."
duolingo,2,17,"great little pp, feels like i'm actually learning and i've always struggled with motivation when learning a language but the pp helps. couple of issues, would like a bit more explanation of rules of a language, i feel like i'm memorising terms rather than understanding them. this is especially the case with masculine and feminine terms, as the pp has simplifies this to ""masculine words end in o, feminine words end in a"" and it's not even true."
duolingo,2,1,"totally discouraged at checkpoint 1 lessons have been great. pp a handy tool for completing lessons away from computer, where it's easier to do lessons and other language activities. got to checkpoint 1 and was tested on everything except what was covered in the previous lessons. whole paragraphs of text contained maybe 5 words that had been taught in preceding lessons. no way to skin checkpoint. how depressing to study hard and be tested on everything except what you've learned. nearly quit."
duolingo,2,10,it's a good way to learn a new language however the experience is completely ruined because of the as. sometimes the screen will freeze and then i will have to re open the pp. i also don't like the fact that when you answer wrong they don't explain how you got the answer wrong. domingo also doesn't seem to accept alternative answers to questions. overall i am dissatisfied
duolingo,2,0,the lessons are good but we need to click all the time to continue some of the histories are with left content and i think that is unnecessary create this kind of think. my kiss do some exercises with me and i don't want to teach left for a kid
duolingo,2,0,"although it can help give you some basic sentences and vocal, it doesn't go into how to create your own sentences using the words you learned. it gives you tools but doesn't teach you how to use them"
duolingo,2,1011,"since they added the heart feature the pp isn't enjoyable anymore. you can only get 5 wrong answers before basically locking you out of the pp. you have to wait hours to get one heart back, then that's only one wrong answer before getting locked out again. it makes starting a language almost impossible because everyone is going to make mistakes starting out, they're not going to want to keep going if the pp tells them they can't keep learning because they failed too many times."
duolingo,2,0,"domingo is a nice pp, but recently i've started experiencing a significant number of bags in this pp. unfortunately, support staff does not react on my numerous email to fix them. so, i have no other choice as to write a negative review here."
duolingo,2,0,"the hearts system makes this otherwise great pp unstable. get a few wrong questions wrong and you can't continue learning. you can't repeat the lesson, even from the beginning. you have to wait hours, reach few hours you get one more heart, which is one more answer you can get wrong. makes me feel stupid, sucks my determination to get this learnt. can't see why it's supposed to help. if it's just to make you pay, then i get that. not sure though, maybe they will have hearts after you pay too."
duolingo,2,5,usually fine but an issue has come up in the leader boards. i finished and place in the gold league yesterday and when i've completed a lesson to start in the next league it's placed me back into the gold league. i'm so confused and annoyed at the effort i put in update: the leaderboard thing is fixed but now i have a whole new problem where after completing a lesson it doesn't save my progress or up and i have to do it all over and it auspiciously starts working again everytime i screenshot
duolingo,2,2,"decent language pp however different people are given different versions, my wife has a version with no ""health"" and gems and she is earning ex and learning language far faster as a result, instead i am slowed down whilst the pp tries to push me to by the premium subscription and watch avert fore more health, the current system allows you to male only 1 mistake every 4 hours. its clear that if you are chosen to have the gems and health version of this pp, you exist only to make them money"
duolingo,2,8,"i really like domingo, but recent updated to both the pp and the webster have made using the pp difficult. the webster and pp having different requirements for leveling up lessons and the inconsistency between lights and gems make for an unpleasant experience. the lives are also an unnecessary ratification feature that serve no purpose other than to hinder learning, which is what domingo is supposed to be about."
duolingo,2,18,"great pp! as long as you dont mind that it can and will take pictures, look at your personal pictures, record audit, record video, modify your settings, modify your sd card, read data on your sd card, delete content on your sd card, search, find and view other accounts tied-in with your phone, analyze wife connections, analyze data from anyone else who is on the same wife as you, run at start up and listen through your microphone. really? why? no thanks . . ."
duolingo,2,229,"to learn words its ok, as its an online pp, there is no explanation as to when and why the word/meanings/phases change, just when you think you've got it, not so! unfortunately i used the plus free trial, and missed the cancellation date, so of course i was charged $167.00, beware as it auto renew in 12 months, together with being constantly bombarded with email from them."
duolingo,2,2,"gets worse to start with this pp is great, it makes sense and reaches you the basis well, then it camps up the learning rate to an insane degree. the first few lessons teach you about 6 words at a time, in the later lessons they expect you to learn a lot more than that so nothing cement itself in your head. for example the body parts lesson expected me to learn about 20 body parts swell as various new adjective in one lesson. my advice is use it sparingly and try to find a better pp."
duolingo,2,0,l am looking for an application which reaches simultaneously two languages together. same words in same unit levels. that should be %15 reduction from total time. domingo is not the one!!! but if l searched simultaneous learning domingo is at first finding! a disappointment of absence. we you show or response by answering?
duolingo,2,0,"i download this to help me brush up on my turkish. although i'm married to a turkish man, i hardly use turkish anymore. this is a really clever way to learn, bordering on genius! it could do with an explanation feature but that's not why i've scored it so low. it's the content that lets this pp down. the pronunciation is sometimes so bad even my husband can't get it! correct answers can lose you a heart. you can use the flag feature to point out mistakes but it changes nothing. disappointing."
duolingo,2,3,completely stuck on multiple hind courses. there are stages in the lessons which have a 'match the letter to the sound' portion and to and the sounds each do not allow me to match them with the provided symbols. so far my only option has been to spend gems to take the test to skin the lesson but if those sounds come up during the lesson then i've wasted gems and cannot continue. the pp has been mostly helpful but its frustration to be stuck with nothing to do on it.
duolingo,2,1,this pp is good but falls short in one aspect it will sometimes allow bad swellings of words when it may be one letter off but other times it will fail you for the same misspelling regardless of level. they also hit you with phrases out of the blue where they have not even covered that phrase or even those words so you are forced to spend more time checking the translation then actually learning anything. immersion is better than showing translation.
duolingo,2,1,"i did not find it enough helpful in learning japanese karagina and anti! this is intended for english people, many things are not precise in this pp. japanese teaching method is also odd here. one should probably find some other apes if they have to learn eastern languages...."
duolingo,2,4,"it relief on rd parties to clarify concepts, which aren't available for every exercise. it is inconsistent in its accepting translations. it provides insufficient preliminary information permanent to the exercises, a lacking variety in practice examples, which only reinforced familiarity with the specific examples, not the concepts. edit: they've introduced a delay in shipping as. i'm sure the ""improvement"" in user experience makes me want to buy premium."
duolingo,2,2,"its helpful i guess. it used to be more so. they taken away some of the best parts of the pp, ak the message boards and guild. also in trying out the plus feature, and i can never finish a progress quit because at around 60%, the pp just freeze. its super disappointing to be honest. i used to recommend this pp a lot since give been studying languages since high school, its really gone downhill"
duolingo,2,0,i was really excited to learn a language i always wanted to learn but they didn't have it. they already have a nice variety but its still small if you want something specific.
duolingo,2,0,"i do 3 apes every day just to keep the sequence. today domingo informed me i had lost my 346 day streak but i could pay to get in back. other apes still continuous. quick appraisal later and i am ditching this. doing spanish and i can't tell if the content writer is a native speaker of spanish or english if either even. there is no theory just random words and phrases thrown out repeatedly so there is no indication of how verbs are derived, nous you just end in o or a! bye."
duolingo,2,0,"i've been working on hind for 50 days. since the beginning, i've been facing the problem of trying to tap pairs together. the last pair through process of elimination should always go together. however, every time i tap the pair to move on, it lights up red and i am unable to move forward from it. i would usually use the gems to skin the lesson whenever i had that problem. now, i can't do that because the pp won't let me do it to ones that i've already completed (to restore). please fix this."
duolingo,2,73,"ok, it was 5/5 stars before they introduced the health points, now you can only make 5 mistakes, then you have to buy more health or you do a practice to gain one single health point. shame, it was such a great learning tool before, on the webster version there is no health points, i don't understand why there have to be health points on the mobile..."
duolingo,2,8,"domingo is a terrible experience. the lessons are too repetition, which makes progress excruciating slow. if you want to move on to new lessons, you have to pass a test. the thing is, the test will have questions with words and phrases that have not yet been covered. so even with doing all the lessons multiple times, passing the test is fairly difficult. on top of that, the pp will nonstop send you modifications and email. i love the idea of free learning, but the pp is seriously flowed."
duolingo,2,2,"a mixed review. previously i had rate this pp 5 star and was a huge advocate for domingo to anyone that would listen. now, since the update around 2 months ago, i'm sad to say that although at its core domingo is a brilliant tool to teach the structure of your desired language in theory, it spends to little time drilling these into you before rushing you onto the next subject matter by over having the number of lessons. this has resulted in very very little retention long term. i'm gutted."
duolingo,2,0,difficult pp to use as it has a complicated reward system. you have to earn hearts and crowns before you can move on to a higher level and you have to repeat the same lessons over and over again if you don't have enough. or buy the plus course.
duolingo,2,0,"it's pretty good, though they need to put more effort into the liability. for example, the font is too small and there's no way to adjust it. also, they should provide a way to bookmark progress so you don't need to stroll stroll stroll stroll to get back to where you were in the lessons."
duolingo,2,16,"the actual content is great, however in the past few years they have began charging money for many things that were previously free, and up the lingo prices for everything, downed the amount of lights that are actually earned, and have limited you to only being able to make 5 mistakes before you have to pay to use the pp or you need to wait 24+ hours to use it again. i am no longer a satisfied user of domingo because of all the money charges, and excessive advertising for money charging"
duolingo,2,0,"only one mode of delivery. no ability to play games, listen to conversation or read exerts. becomes a boring way of learning. too easy to guess without really learning anything. set as a competition to score against other players which only inventivices to go through the lessons faster without retaining. pp has a great deal of room for improvement. the one good thing is the simple approach it uses to teaching a language with clear sections and methodolocial way more words are introduced."
duolingo,2,17,"keeps slamming my email after concealing 3 different types of email and disabling everything in the pp... also said i was out of hearts, i had 3. also the whole heart system is just awful. also the free trial is like 90€ after the free week if you don't cancel. it's okay for learning but it's a shame that the developer keep trying to scar your money."
duolingo,2,3,"this pp was really good but there's something , the problem i have is that i had voice but since a few weeks ago i have had no voice at all, my purpose was speaking spanish and notice that but how can i do that now ? overall i'm dissatisfied"
duolingo,2,2,"i liked the previous version better, without the hearts and having to wait for them to refill or whatever, so many colors and simply designed features my eyes are hurting. some things are better left untouched."
duolingo,2,0,"as expected, domingo isn't the best when it comes to actual learning, especially concerning grammar. it also doesn't help that in many exercises, it will say you made a mistake even though you used the exactly right sentence."
duolingo,2,0,like the pp but i find the font far to small and unable to make it bigger. developer need to address this problem anyone who's eye sight isn't perfect struggles. i'm not going to pay for plus when i can't see it.
duolingo,2,9,"it's too bad. used to be really good and stable, but now they are more focused on a ""fun"" interface and banking than the functionality of the pp. so many bags, like consistently not getting the streak jingle until the next day, lessons not registering up, but daily goal still being met, even if the up says it isn't. getting stuck. if i wasn't on a 660 days plus streak, i'd find another pp, because domingo has really dropped significantly in quality, unfortunately."
duolingo,2,0,"my patience is running out with this pp. it asks me to translate a sentence with the 'click on' word option. i click the words and translate it perfectly. the answer comes up as incorrect, showing me the correction as the exact words i clicked on. this is happening more and more costing me my comb up and lives. also, my partners pp doesn't have lives, so why does mine? and why does it need 5 hours to rejuvenated 1 life? i thought this was free education forever? not a greedy money making play"
duolingo,2,0,the pp was great .... but now you only have a couple if chances to get it right before you loose your hearts. ..pay out if your lights to replenished but doesn't always do it. bags with the hints getting stuck on screen and bags with the sound .....it used to be more fun more free and much much more simple
duolingo,2,12,"it's misleading when it says one can use it office using the paid version. it needs to update itself all the time, so if there's no internet connection, there's nothing one can do. all the time there's an error message when one click on a lesson, to work, one needs to click a second time. i'm very disappointed."
duolingo,2,0,good pp in general but the sound cuts out random making it extremely frustration!
duolingo,2,0,i thought it was free with an option to pay 4 pound a month for extra activities but £56 has been taken from my account straight away not happy
duolingo,2,0,my friend had this pp and told me about it and a week later she accidently turned on the plus version (which costs money) and not the cheap one the yearly one!!! and it cost almost a £100 and no cancelli because she forgot on the day. i'm not saying the pp is bad but that is just my experience.
duolingo,2,17,used to be such a great pp until they added in the heart feature. takes the fun out of learning as it punishes you for getting the answer wrong. its impossible to learn a new language without making mistakes and the heart feature means if you make too many mistakes to can learn anymore for a few hours.
duolingo,2,0,"ok yes it's pretty good the only thing that's more of a pain is the hearts, like really? i use this for school so i need to use it more then the hearts make me be able to do. it's even recommend in my school to use domingo so i really hate the hearts when i lose all of them and isn't able to continue my studying, it really doesn't need to be there. if this is changed it would be a lot better then it is, even on most of the community conversations is about the hearts to get ride of it."
duolingo,2,9,"good language learning pp. there are occasional bags, and you need somewhat good network connection. you can only make 5 mistakes unless you pay real money; this move is a capitalists garage. this is especially bad since the leaderboard (ak leagues) was introduced giving fairness among users."
duolingo,2,0,works great until you hit lessons with missing/unlicked audit files (chinese).
duolingo,2,0,"i think this is a great start to learning a new language. however, i want to go back and test myself on the words and its not letting me do that. why? its also an issue when the voice part, wont allow the word to be corrected when doing speech."
duolingo,2,0,"it was an excellent learning tool before the implementation of the hearts feature. putting chances in a free-to-play game is understandable, but turning a teaching resource into a moneymaking gazing service is trite, counterproductive, and crass. the saline of free language learning no longer applies"
duolingo,2,1,for some reason it often ask the same question couple times in a row even thought i answered correctly and a at this point i don't need to see it again. and in questions where you have to choose the meaning of the word there are usually 3 option and 2 of them are so obviously wrong even a monkey would guess a right one. because of that i often find myself just choosing the only option that fits without even knowing what i'm clinking because other are so plain stupid.
duolingo,2,0,"good pp for absolute beginners, but as i ve taken already some spanish lessons, the content is dull for me. just repeating and no progress in learning. bow, i m just using the free pp. maybe there is a feature which aims at progressing quicker... but to date i m not interested to pay for it.."
duolingo,2,0,"sometimes the volume goes out, mid exercise. you can see the speaker animation, but the voice is mute. i can complete the exercise, if i can hear what is being said. i have started over multiple times, because of this problem"
duolingo,2,0,"the pp is good but i dislike the use of achievements, gems and hearts. it makes it feel like a game and when you run out of hearts you can't continue your lesson, which defeats the purpose of the pp."
duolingo,2,2,when you make mistakes you run out of hearts and you can't play if you don't have money for extra ones. you have to wait hours to get one heart which equals to one mistake and then all over again...wish i could learn the languages without any problems and practice as long as i want...but no...
duolingo,2,0,"generally a nice pp but ridiculously overpriced for plus version. if it was a little more unfordable i'd buy it, even if to just repair a streak, but the fact that it's gone up 3 bucks a month in a matter of months is dumb. goodby streak and my motivation for even using the pp consistently"
duolingo,2,4,the pp is fine and i like the way it work but the hearts system is terrible and really keeps you from progressing. my wife has the pp on her phone and its great bc it doesn have the hearts system. its not worth the frustration. being allowed 5 mistake a day is insane. in just glad i have another pp to help with my studies
duolingo,2,0,"this is why i don't like using domingo past a certain point. ""what kind of lunch are we having today?"" and ""what are we having for lunch?"" mean the same thing. and it's also why i get so angry with this pp and the fact that we lose hearts! this pp just makes me angry more than it reaches me."
duolingo,2,46,"nice concept but very buggy and zero customer support. the program for learning italian is badly explained (idioms and unusual construct thrown in without any prior or later explanation ) , very repetition (same examples over and over and over again until your autocorrect already learns them), contains some weird and frankly disturbing sentences for practice ('when do they die?', 'i don't have the cow but i have the leather' etc.). the users are left to each other for support and advice."
duolingo,2,0,very nice when it's only a male voice. i get everything wrong when i have to type the female voiced stuff because she just isn't pronouncing it correctly. this is the case for german anyway.
duolingo,2,0,"someone please fix the arabic course! i like domingo for other languages and i understand that arabic is still fairly new to the pp, but i feel like the audit is off (either incomplete or plays on random words incorrectly). overall i feel like domingo could pay more attention to the arabic course and fix up some of the issues"
duolingo,2,0,"i was unfortunate enough to get a version of domingo that has an extremely scurvy ""hearts"" system for lessons. it's your standard money-rubbing premium move; ""oh no, you made a mistake in that lesson and you're out of hearts. would you like to wait four hours for another chance, or pay now to instantly refill it?"" they have rolled this system out as a random test group; my close friends have a different economic system and can use the pp whenever they want. and i can't. weak."
duolingo,2,0,frustrated by the pressure to create a profile. didn't have to do that in the past you want too much information
duolingo,2,0,it's not challenging at all and this pp only really reaches you vocabulary and words. it doesn't tell you how to property put sentences together or say the words well. there are better apes in my opinion.
duolingo,2,105,"nowhere near as good as the web brother version. missing explanations given in brother, gets stuck on match the pair items that should match as the only final pair and yet can't progress from that, and uses the same audit files for similar sounds while testing you expecting you to know a difference that isn't present when using identical sound files. these issues have been around for a while."
duolingo,2,0,"why do i still get as when i pay do plus subscription!!!??? and i practice a lot and make like 500 up, then i see this next person gathering more than 3000 up in no time!!! how come some can get up that quickly and others can't? and why do you put people like that in the same league as others that must struggle to get 500 up!!!! this passes me off why do i pay for a subscription when i still get as???????? shall i just cancel my subscription?????? i am not happy with this.......🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
duolingo,2,0,"i'm trying to subscribe from my domingo plus account and it's almost impossible to find a way of doing so. i've tried all the obvious, managing subscriptions on several accounts etc. anybody have any idea what the problem could be?"
duolingo,2,0,"it's a good pp, just getting fed up, that i can not save my progresses. as i run out of gems credit or whatever it is. i watch all the avert and yet it will not let me continue. can not save anything and had enough of it"
duolingo,2,1,"why do i constantly have to practice hiragana and katakana to ""restore this skill""???? are you bidding me?! i use domingo to learn anti, and i'm forced to waste like 15 minutes every day on this! i do know hiragana and katakana already! there is just no way i could forget them while practicing other skill - it's a basic skill! please stop torturing me with this!"
duolingo,2,0,what happen in your pp? i just installed it in my phone then longed in using my account on my desktop then suddenly the pp closed. i tried to open it for several times but its not working. i even tried to reinstate it but the pp still closes before i even tried to play the game. pus fix this. thanks!
duolingo,2,0,"hi, i have download the pp yesterday and i don't have an account so when i got to the choose the language i choose that because of my business but it says that,""if you choose that the pp interfere will change to that "" but i don't know only how to read that alphabet then how will i understand and learn that. my elder brother is learning french from it but the language in home page is in english so i want the the english in that also. this is the why i am giving the pp 2 star"
duolingo,2,0,it gives you the basic terms to make introduction etc but it is more memorization than learning. the downside is the constant carriage of email pressing you to login. the cone no matter how long you use the ad or how many as or video you sit through.
duolingo,2,0,there are still bags with audit being delayed and sometimes not playing
duolingo,2,1,"i love domingo, but the holiday sale price for domingo plus falsely shows the regular price for a 12-month subscription as $16.99/month so that they can claim a 60% reduction to $6.99, when really and truly the regular 12-month subscription price is $8.99 (of which 60% would be $3.60/month). deception."
duolingo,2,0,for some strange reason my speech aide refuses to work.
duolingo,2,0,"sometimes the audit dont work for the lessons and after a month it stopped working, i can open the pp and see all the lessons but i cannot enter to any courses! i installed the pp to re-install it but it's stuck at 99% and cannot be installed!"
duolingo,2,8,"decided to try it again with a friend, doing the spanish course. what's becoming infuriating is your as are freezing, looking, or the time keeps starting and never ends, which means i have to force close the pp and lose my rewards for watching the as."
duolingo,2,1,"hi there i like this software but last update,for some time the software does not work and for example words and sounds are not heard and completely interrupted. it also doesn't show tips."
duolingo,2,2,this is not a free pp. it essentially forces you to watch as to proceed. you get punished for mistakes then you have to wait hours to use the pp. very silly demonetization schemes that aren't at all suitable for learning.
duolingo,2,6,the 5 lives system is ridiculous you are able to make 5 mistakes and then be locked out and forced to wait 5 hours (a ridiculous amount of time) for 1 more life or take a quit above your level. i get the point of this is to push people to premium but it gets incredibly frustration
duolingo,2,0,"i dont like this new crack feature, because it makes me anxious. i dont do new material because ""its donna go down, i gutta do the others"" i wish it was optional. to have cracked skill. plus i do multiple languages, so my other languages are all cracking while i focus on my main one."
duolingo,2,1,i believe every language should start at the basis like how children learn. start with letters and the sounds they make. then go from there. dont just throw people into full words learning a new language is hard enough.
duolingo,2,3,i was having fun until i got refill my hearts and it took all my gems and gave me no hearts...other than that it is fun...it is just frustration that you lose a heart for every wrong answer instead of per failed course. it slow your learning a lot of you aren't made of money
duolingo,2,0,"i was having a pretty good experience with this pp so far, and recommended it to family. however, there are bags. i am stuck at english to hind letters 3 level 0 lesson 1 due to a bug, so i cannot move forward and have lost hearts. i already contracted the developer over 2 weeks ago with the details, but have not received a response so i don't know if the issue is being addressed. update: i have installed the pp because i was not helped and there are still issues."
duolingo,2,0,"nice application, however i got stock at one step of the game, where you have to pair sound with the word, sound doesn't play at one button and does not allow to continue"
duolingo,2,0,"starting from about 2-3 months ago i can't use this pp any more. the font size(s) has become too small and it ignores my system font settings. hey, please fix this! i'm on xiaomi red note x with standard mimi global (11.0.2 currently)"
duolingo,2,0,awesome pp love it so much just have one problem with it sometimes if i choose the right answer it would show it's right but say its wrong it happens to my friend too other than than that its amazing i would recommend it would change to 5 stars if they fixed the problem
duolingo,2,0,"a few lessons available for trial, not enough words to make it interesting, does it save progress after a few days, repeating same lesson. better if could hear what the words sounded like , wouldn't purchase,"
duolingo,2,3,"the oct 1 update is terrible. it keeps saying my streak freeze was used up because i didn use the pp the day before, which is false. now it took my 384 day streak and brought it down to 0 day streak. i had a streak freeze and it failed to use it."
duolingo,2,0,it's really annoying that i feel bulldozed into upbraiding to domingo plus and that i cannot access the pp on my phone
duolingo,2,0,"it's pretty boring , not a lot of teaching , you're mostly just repeating like a monkey . i installed it eventually as it has some wrong answers on purpose, which make you run out of hearts very fast . will be looking into some more decent apes ."
duolingo,2,0,"lately, all the audit is buggy. whenever i start an exercise, if i pick my option faster than the speech, it will break the speech for the rest of the exercises."
duolingo,2,0,"i was really enjoying learning a little spanish while visiting mexico and found domingo to be helpful. however, it stopped being useful at checkpoint 1 as the exam had new words, grammar and complex construct that had nothing to do with the previous lessons. i was hoping to continue. but i've lost faith in the process. twitching to a different pp."
duolingo,2,0,"guns, unfortunately the andros pp lacks so many features when compared to the is :( this andros version looks ancient. although, i really appreciate the free experience but the lack of features makes me wonder if i want to go ahead and get the paid version :("
duolingo,2,0,i've always loved this pp. i'm trying to learn russian but it's trying to make me type in russian but my phone wont let me use a russian keyboard. which means i can move for ward in the lessons and it keeps failing me. if you dont a keyboard for the language you want to learn(on your device)then dont download domingo.
duolingo,2,0,it has no sound i just can hear ratification of true and false but not the sound of pronunciation please solve it
duolingo,2,1,"the pp is lagging. my internet connection is fine but when i click into the lesson, i could only click one word and then the pp just doesn't do anything after that."
duolingo,2,0,"the tutorials are helpful. but trying to sign with correct email address is a pain, it keep saying it's in valid. and you have to do that to do anything."
duolingo,2,0,the hearts i use in learning my language never gets filled and this has been happening for months even after i updated the pp. please i would need your assistance to fix this. thanks
duolingo,2,0,"i loved your pp and i'm using for many years. but if there was a choice which helps me with british english, i would be very glad. (my main language is not english)"
duolingo,2,3,i am paying for a pro account and within 1 week there have been programming errors in the watching letters to sounds exercises. this has prevented me from completing my daily exercises and is demotivating.
duolingo,2,0,"unable to sign into the pp. since the latest update, every time i try to sign into the pp it revert straight back to the getting started page and only gives me the option to create a new account or sign in again."
duolingo,2,1,"good pp for starting, but it seriously lacks grammar as you you progress through the german language. for a language where grammar is important it's not helpful to memories things but not be able to apply learning"
duolingo,2,5,"i love the whole thing, but the hearts suck. all of the fun of learning is ruined. the internet says it's so that people don't ""tinge"" because it's ""ineffective for learning"". i'm not going to tinge, i just want to be able to learn for more than five minutes a day. it's impossible to do anything when your new and aren't really understanding the languages. what anger me even more is that my entire family has the older version and domingo is testing on the newer players, which is dumb for this."
duolingo,2,0,"the application does not work in portrait mode, and feedback is stuck in a loop via catch to report it. not useful when using a fixed keyboard"
duolingo,2,0,my mon got this pp before it was updated and i got it after. the new update is upsetting because the older version is cheaper and doesn't limit you with hearts. i dislike the update but otherwise this is a fairly good pp.
duolingo,2,1,"i dont like the new update because of ""hearts"". i used to love this but once you make 5 mistakes you have to wait until tomorrow to play again. can hardly learn japanese because of this. dont download"
duolingo,2,0,"i would have given this 5 stars before the latest update and had recommended a lot of friends and family to use this pp. however, as a teacher, i can't london how poorly you've structures the pp after the latest update. it is not teaching it is just throwing information out to the userbase and hoping something sticks."
duolingo,2,2,"now, dropping down to a 2 star, now you guns are trying to do a pay to learn? was a great pp, now its loaded with as, and if you get two incorrect answers you have to pay for more "" hearts "" ....."
duolingo,2,2,"domingo plus is useless... i have download the japanese course for office but it does not work! it says "" your japanese course is available office"" but when i try to click on it office it says ""recollect to the internet to load this skill""... please do something"
duolingo,2,0,"teach support is responsive, questions and comments get locked. study material is not provided. the material is very repetition. other than that i really, really, really like the application.:)"
duolingo,2,0,"i love the pp, but i've been having a really bad bug where i've had to red several lessons two or more times. recently, i've had to do the spanish family lesson three times already, and it still hasn't moved me forward even though i have perfect answers. please fix this!!!"
duolingo,2,2,even though i finished first place in a league it didn't move me to the next league or give me any credit for my lessons i tried to report the issue but it denied it 4 time when trying to submit it so i gave up i refuse to pay for an pp that i can't submit a problem to the company
duolingo,2,1,"it's translation is basic direct translation, which is good for beginners but bad for intermediate or advanced learning. forced to hold my phone vertically the whole time like a jackets."
duolingo,2,0,the sound of this pp is inactive and i can't hear the exercises...what should i do?
duolingo,2,1,it's a good pp in the beginning and then it keeps saying ( this pp is blocked )
duolingo,2,0,"in trying to learn hind, one of the quires had an incorrect answer; no matter what i tried the quit would not complete. i contracted domingo via email to attempt to get it fixed and never had a response and never had the problem fixed. therefore i switched to a paid pp called rocket languages. the rocket languages pp incorporated writing, speaking, and listening; it does have some bags as well but not ones that have prevented my learning. you're welcome."
duolingo,2,1,poor pp support. the plus 'office' feature does not work and i cannot get a refund for the 6 month subscription i paid £48 to use.
duolingo,2,0,"my domingo is showing me office , why ? i'm practicing turkish language and i want to skin some of steps because i know it before . when i skin these lessons it shows you are office . kindly let me know the solution"
duolingo,2,0,unfortunately my pp doesn't have any voice and i don't know where can i set it. i've just installed it
duolingo,2,1,i think it is quite odd how you have fantasy languages but not actual languages like finnish or iceland. i hope you will add more real languages that people actually use because the pp is good and very helpful too
duolingo,2,2,"constantly asks about domingo plus and referring a friend for a free week. however, upon referring a friend, no free week is given and the founding over trying plus is more annoying than the as."
duolingo,2,0,at first it was great after a while i see it's too slow and i have no sound please fix the problem in new update because it's really annoying and fraustrating currently
duolingo,2,0,"good for languages such as french, spanish and swedish as such but just is at arabic and japanese,"
duolingo,2,2,"was helpful before but since the latest updated with the ""hearts"" exercising is really limited and you just navigable through incentive to go for the plus version, quite frustration"
duolingo,2,0,"there is problem in german language in ""type what you here"" part. in new update it can not play sounds especially by heads."
duolingo,2,0,"the actual pp is very helpful, but once u get too many questions wrong u run out of hearts, so have to wait hours to go back on the pp. a bit disappointing"
duolingo,2,0,"was a five star experience till the pp decided it wasn't going to allow me to type the correct answer. that snuff for me to not want to waste my time. the item was milk, la lech except as soon as you type la and hit the space bar it would ease the la if you put a space first you can spell it correctly but the anew is still wrong due to the space"
duolingo,2,0,"shows i have a ratification, but when i open the pp and look for a ratification, there's nothing there. and there's no way to get rid of the ratification indication... annoying. i guess i'll just have to install the pp"
duolingo,2,0,it was good. but now you have lives. 3 mistakes and you have to wait hours to keep practicing. and they take 4 his to get 1. you used to be able to learn a lot. now it's almost useless. disappointed with that change.
duolingo,2,0,"good, but sometimes baggy. i lost my 31-day streak because the pp did not load any of the lessons the entire day. and i worked hard for those!"
duolingo,2,0,the pp is still having sound issues during the middle of a lesson
duolingo,2,4,was once a good pp until they incorporated that league system. it's pretty useless and annoying in my opinion. please remove that and bring back the practice option again.
duolingo,2,0,no british english option for native language. just makes it annoying to the point of refraining from throwing my phone. foi it's football not soccer.
duolingo,2,0,"good at first but as soon as the lessons goes further it becomes harder, they just give you sentences to translate which you never learned from this pp."
duolingo,2,1,"2. the same happened again; i was fifth of ten to get into the diamond league.. and i didn't get it again.. i wonder why they make the competition if they don't let you win!!! *&#$%!@¥% is what i think about it. 1. i am really mad, because i was eighth for the diamond league, and just when the countdown finished, it said that something went wrong and i did not get the level!!! don't let people compete i'd you are not going to give them the points, or the next level.."
duolingo,2,0,it is really easy to learn on domingo. i think they shouldn't have health because you barely get to learn because it takes so long to get your health back.
duolingo,2,0,this game is fun and all...but when the update came..it's pretty hard to learn..
duolingo,2,1,please make updated mandatory. people abuse the practice lessons to gain up to remain at the top of leaderboards which makes it unfair to the people who have updated apes and learn the legitimate way. please fix this.
duolingo,2,0,2 stars because there are clot of errors and no developer have responded or fixed! i would rate 5 stars if i riding have to deal with answering right several times and no matter what i enter it says in wrong! or there wont be sound for the listening exercises.
duolingo,2,0,the pp is pretty good. however if you subscribe. there instructions to subscribe are incorrect and they make it difficult to do.
duolingo,2,0,sure it may help but i absolutely hate the hearts. it gets me soon damn frustrated when i get five wrong in the middle of damn lesson. it makes me lose my progress and does not help at all. i cannot stand it and i barely have anything learned
duolingo,2,3,"disappointed. this pp does not explain new material as you go. you just keep getting things wrong until you look it up for yourself on the webster. how short-sighted! also, what's with those silly lights? painless."
duolingo,2,0,confusing to use. fun when you get it right but i kept 'running out of hearts' and couldn't do any more that day!?
duolingo,2,0,"the pp is alright considering it's for free, but the fact that it so unbelievably politically based and tries to show that to you in almost every sentence made me consider meeting it a couple of times.."
duolingo,2,0,i have practiced and practiced and some lessons i just can't do in one day but i don't get credit for trying. it isn't fair you only get credit if you pass a lesson. i have been stuck at the same lesion for over a week and only get credit if i review and pass a previous one. some skill are forced on beginners too soon. esp sentence structure.
duolingo,2,1,you took away my 311 day streak--even though i was equipped with a streak freeze!--just to try to force me to pay for streak repair!!!
duolingo,2,0,"hi, this pp has wrong pronunciation in word ""often"" for english language. my native language is russian and it is enter some misunderstanding for people who learn end. language. dear developer, please fix it."
duolingo,2,0,"it's a great pp, but the five hour wait for more lives is super annoying. and it needs an internet connection"
duolingo,2,0,"when i tried to use domingo to learn latin, i found that it took way too long to get to crucial material (tense other than the present, for example) and spent way too long on painlessly obscure vocabulary (i doubt i'll ever need to know the latin words for ""parrot"" or ""wesel""). i stopped because after awhile i felt like i was wasting my time. this pp would be improved by stressing grammar more and vocabulary less."
duolingo,2,0,"the 5 mistakes/hearts thing sucks, but the pp has proved very enjoyable to learn new words/phrases in another language thus far."
duolingo,2,0,"yeah, this pp used to be amazing. but now, it won't let me onto my old account, so now, i lost all my progress!!!"
duolingo,2,0,"it doesn't how much you prioritize for banking up in the pp, nothing change even the points are the same as the first level, so what is the point of banking up the levels?"
duolingo,2,0,speaking exercises are not available for andros devices. this is a serious impediment to liability.
duolingo,2,0,the pp stop working so many times. sometimes the audit doesn't work and it's really distressful
duolingo,2,0,its hard to do sentencing if i have trouble remembering individual words or phrases! you can just dish out sentences and characters at the same time if i dont know what characters they are its frustrateing i feel like i blew 100 bucks i barely anna use this pp
rosettastone,2,32,"i spent 60 dollars for 3 months. first off it's a great learning tool, but the pp has big problems. it signs you out after you exit so you have to mentally sign in everytime you open the pp. the pp clashes during lessons. the pp will not load and will say its network connection problems, despite my nearly perfect internet connection. if it weren't for these problems, i'd be very pleased with it."
rosettastone,2,7,"i feel that roseola stone has a lot of potential but,i was really looking forward to speaking spanish until the quality and payments.the quality of the audit is terrible.i feel that the price is outrageous!and all i wanted was to speak spanish!i got really disappointed that i couldn't learn today because i realized that all of this had to be paid for."
rosettastone,2,19,"buggy interface on my andros device makes replying sounds frustration because the pp thinks you are selecting an answer. also the mid is unable to differentiate even simple absent noise, making the spoken exercises impossible in anything other than a silent padded room."
rosettastone,2,0,has the biggest struggle recognizing what i'm saying. i have to repeat myself 12 times for it to register what i say. frustration.
rosettastone,2,1,"voice recognition says in too loud no matter how quietly i speak after the last few updated, making me frustrated to go through each lesson."
rosettastone,2,0,it is great but it would be better if you will make half of materials in the pp free
rosettastone,2,3,"not a bad pp...but learning a language shouldn cost money, i couldn learn much because it asked for money, so i installed, 💯💯💯💯💯💯"
rosettastone,2,0,i think i'll like it. only thing is my time frame to learn it is at work and during nap time so learning with sleeping kiss makes it a little hard when needing to be quit but can't wait to get free time after work when at home life is less busy i like it
rosettastone,2,31,"poor pp design. so many features are missing that it's laughable. i finished all 12 units of japanese for school, just to get told that i haven't done the writing lessons, which aren't even available on the pp! i had to do the rest on pp. if i had to do it on pp then why is there an pp? also, the speech recognition needs work. i've had several instances where i said the correct answer perfectly, and all the words lit up as correct, but then it gives me a red ""x"" and i have to say it again."
rosettastone,2,2,"it is a good pp, except for 2 problems i have with it. some of the exercises use icons too small to see on a mobile device, and it can't be transferred to an external storage device. i can't use it office because it takes too much storage space."
rosettastone,2,8,"the pp doesn't pick up sounds well. i've used headphones and the mid on the phone and it does not recognize my voice consistently. i see this is a regular theme with this pp as many others have said the same. this is frustration because i would like to do this on the go, but it seems it works best at home."
rosettastone,2,1,"so i moved to france and in trying to get my french to a level where i can survive. the pp is cool and has taught me a good amount, but it doesn't explain why i use certain words in certain sentences. just practically flash cards. this is frustration cause in on week 5 and still can't form my own sentences because i don't know what words to use or why i would use those words."
rosettastone,2,2,"i'm making no progress whatsoever, i'd recommend learning arabic a different way."
rosettastone,2,8,love the pp but terrible customer service!!!! overcharged me. when i called in they tried to justify over charging be by claiming that they couldn't see my location. i live in atlantic canada. i told them that's where i live. my debit card is canadian. my bank is canadian. isn't that enough? no!!! and then i'm effectively not helped and transferred in circles. so even though i love the software i'm asking for a full refund. i'll go with a competitor instead.
rosettastone,2,13,"the microphone performance is extremely louse. nor can you select or even see what input device is being used, if for example a bluetooth device is connected. thank you roseola stone, for being the most expensive language learning pp you have failed to deliver on the most critical feature."
rosettastone,2,94,"i am using the pp for japanese learning. it tries to offer the same functionality like the desktop but fails. the problems that i encountered are: 1.the pictures are too small, 2.is lacking functionality of the desktop version, 3.twitching between japanese alphabet is a pain, 4.the pp sometimes forgets the credentials, 5.it requires constant internet connection even if you choose to download the lesson. good idea but very poor implementation."
rosettastone,2,35,"not very good or helpful. when i repeat something exactly it tells me i said it incorrectly. then i humble some jibberish and it tells me i said it correctly. most of the time in not 100% sure what i am learning to say because in just repeating words. they advertise that this program reaches how the cutler thinks to better understand the language. didn't get that from what i have learned. wish i could get a refund. if you learn from just repeating then buy it, if not, save your money."
rosettastone,2,6,"i'm so disappointed. i don't agree with this method of learning with image only. i need to see the translation in order to know exactly what i'm saying. i will not retain information in this manner otherwise i would just watch spanish speaking to instead of paying for this pp. this program does not allow you to customize settings to minimize the individuals learning style. also, how about starting off with absolute basis like gender."
rosettastone,2,10,"i already know the basis but when i chose a plan to learn more, everything was locked and i had to pay for it, if it is classed as a free way to learn there should be most things unlocked however there were flashcards with helpful phrases on so that was good"
rosettastone,2,1,"i had no idea what the words were and could not pass, for me it was a bad pp. but it could be good for you! ✌❤😁"
rosettastone,2,8,"it was noted on the pp that my subscription would cancel on with october, and yet it renewed a day early, completely unexpected! i want a refund, but goose pay is not registering it!! this is horrible, all my experience with this pp has taken a nosedive"
rosettastone,2,2,well i was donna use this pp ... but based on all the bad reviews it has and what pp are saying online about it i think i will pass last thing i want is to wast more money on an pp that's not fully developed or half a$$ and be disappointed .... if they want to offer a 5-10 day free trial without charging my credit card then i'm all for it! but making me pay full price right up front before i even get a chance to try it i'm over that!!
rosettastone,2,1,"it's telling me how to pronounce words but doesn't tell you what the words mean, instead it has a small picture which can be interpreted in many different ways. i won't pay to use this."
rosettastone,2,0,"when i clicked a button, e.g. lesson 2 core lesson the pp would instead bring me to lesson 1 listening and reading. it's probably due to enabling extended learning feature."
rosettastone,2,2,no option other than monthly subscription. should be a one time purchase per language you want option.
rosettastone,2,2,speech recognition is horrible? even simple sounds either dont get picked up or are impossible to pass
rosettastone,2,0,the pp forced me to leave this review by asking me every time i complete an activity. so enjoy your two stars for being absolute bombarded
rosettastone,2,0,"speech recognition sometimes works... for a product asking for so much money, i would expect more."
rosettastone,2,0,i dont think it really helps learn a language. you dont actually learn the phrases it just makes you guess pictures and match them to the phrase. absolutely awful
rosettastone,2,0,it's for learning languages but the way they do it has no back up at least in the free min lessons they show me a woman eating but don't say woman or female or anything just that and would not recommend really
rosettastone,2,0,it is not free its a free trial then they want payment
rosettastone,2,1,"nice concept, intuition execution. has potential. sons: -lacks depth. very sluggish pace. a one month course or podcast can teach you far more than the whole pp. -animation take too much time, to the point where it's 30 seconds animation for 1 click. this means that out of the 30 minute session, perhaps just 5 minutes are actual content."
rosettastone,2,2,the voice recognition system is horrible
rosettastone,2,0,because most the items for pay not free
rosettastone,2,0,"poor user experience and poor i. feels like it's made in flash! very poor layout, poor learning tools. if you want to actually learn try something like busy. they know how to blend technology and education to create a good learning experience. this is very poor for 2019. would have been ok 18 years ago but not now"
rosettastone,2,0,the idea of the pp is amazing but it's very hard without any english words to learn chinese! sometimes i can't understand what those characters mean and it's very hard to use by the sound inman to translate them into english in goose translator.
rosettastone,2,0,the program pick up little background noise so doesn't stop listening after i've pronounced a word. it would be nice if they had a dictionary for each unit to help understand some of the words that you're learning.
rosettastone,2,0,"(when learning japanese) i found the pp very difficult to use and difficult to grasp compared to other apes on the market. it took me longer to understand and use the pp. there is no written translations, only pictures, which can be confusing. there was no explanations for grammar etc. it's very impersonal, even the modifications are vague and impersonal."
rosettastone,2,0,"too pectoral dependent. need a big phone screen to see the small pictures clearly and sharp eyes. no grammar explanations. depends on shallow immersion to learn. not deep enough to be effective. based on early lessons, i gave up."
rosettastone,2,1,"not good for kiss,it is very hard to recognize kiss voice. i am try using this pp with my 6 years son learn english,stuck at ""a girl is drinking"",i am try lot of times,include loud and whisper,adjust option to male or female，adjust sensitivity.all not work.still not recognize. after about 10 min,my son not interested in this pp."
rosettastone,2,0,voice recognition on the pp basically doesn work. it works fine on the desktop version the. give also tried to contact customer service and there no one on hand and no one gets back to you. its good if you dont need any help and can use it on a lawton. otherwise your on your own!
rosettastone,2,0,"too expensive. i purchased the d version for my son. when i saw there was an pp for mobile devices i thought it would be a great addition. but, you have to buy the pp. and it's not cheap. mio it should be included in the (not cheap) price of the d program."
rosettastone,2,0,isnthis free to create an account and learn any language?or are there hidden fees?
rosettastone,2,7,"i read some reviews and seemed it was worth the money because it came with free lessons, but that's not the case you have to pay. i was given an offer of 160 for a year, which i took....then noticed as saying 10 a month and £5 a month, which takes the pass! if you have a price and an offer have one, not several it means you don't value your product. grammar lessons are unclear you have to figure it out as there is no definition or english translation. i should of stuck with do lingo!"
rosettastone,2,0,2019 year by the way. add login with ff/goose account!
rosettastone,2,0,"bizarre, i signed up through my local library, which i presume has a funding agreement. i follow the directions (in download pp, don't launch, but activate through the library). all goes well. i work my way 3/4 through core. next day, it didn't recognize my password. i do a rest through my email, sign in and in in the middle of hind which i hasn't choose. roseola tells me it's a domo copy, delete. better more unfordable apes like busy."
rosettastone,2,0,the way the pp works is if you have a basic understanding of the language. for me trying to learn organ it says the word and has you guess the picture or will have you repeat the word or phrase and will not give a meaning. also when you sign up they don't tell you about the automatic renewal so that is an expensive surprise.
rosettastone,2,6,so my only problem with this software sit's voice recognition that does a really good job some of the time but most of the time it just lets you down and i've tried this with a variety of wired and tireless headphones and just using the phone itself. i also went out of my way to try in various environment to make sure there was no background noise for the speaker to confuse what i saying. wasted clot of money on features found elsewhere cheaper
rosettastone,2,0,"was really looking forward to it but ended up not trying it. it came up under a ""learn spanish free"" search, but then after you download it you have to set up an account, then get a ""free trial"". i know it's a wonderful product, but it should have been forthcoming instead of wasting my time luring me in, when i knew up front i couldn't pay anything."
rosettastone,2,8,"i have an additional set of concerns w the pp (now that i have gotten my subscription issues resolved) - the images at the top, when selecting what picture belongs with the words, are incredibly small and hard to decipher at times. secondly, even the beginner version is a bit too fast, when i hit pause to be able to absorb what being said, it doesn pause the screen. it brings me back to the menu of chapters in the lesson. not helpful."
rosettastone,2,41,i like the approach you have taken for learning the language. but the pp isn't very good the pictures are just too small for a smartphone. i have to spend way too much time finding tiny details. and that's with my glasses. it might be fine for a tablet but i don't have one of those. the pp freeze a lot and i can't select anything. i have to close and re-start. it's a little baggy. predictable and frustration on my new phone.
rosettastone,2,0,way too expensive and not a great way to learn. you'll just be guessing at everything.
rosettastone,2,2,"good for learning languages but the pp itself is pretty bad considering you have to pay for the service. if the media volume is down i can raise it easily in pp, i have to either fiddle with the sound option or load a game and increase it there. also when ever i load the pp it is never on my next lesson, its always like 5 ahead or 5 behind for some reason. there are also times when it just doesn pick up my phone mid until i start the pp, even though it was working the lesson before."
rosettastone,2,1,if you want to learn a language this pp is good to instal but when you are learning the language it asks you to say a certain phrase but it always says that the audit is too loud. this is really annoying as i am doing and saying exactly what it wants. this is why the pp is more bad than good😒
rosettastone,2,6,"everytime i use the pp on andros it requires me to go through the whole sign in process of putting in my email, password, and work code. it has really limited my usage as i would have to log in multiple times a day just to continue a lesson. i don't understand why the application is designed that way. it makes me not want to use it."
rosettastone,2,2,"this pp competent reaches language through immersion and relief on you using context clues to figure out what is said. i think it's genius. but while learning makarin, it would pair the wrong pictures to the phrase and trip me up. like saying ""those people are cooking"" while showing a picture of people walking as the correct paring. i wish i was allowed a free trial instead. this was a waste of time and money."
rosettastone,2,101,"this is a terrible option if you are trying to learn japanese. i have consistent problems with the voice recognition. my setting are correct and i have tried uninstalling and reinstating yet the issues persist. i am not sure if roseola stone is a good option for other languages, but definitely look for other option for japanese."
rosettastone,2,0,"ok, so i'm trying japanese, and it's just showing me a picture, and giving me a sentence, and you match them. it's almost 100% guess work, it still hasn't gone over the japanese letters or compared the japanese with english. i'm not truly understanding it"
rosettastone,2,8,"i was pretty happy at first but then became extremely disappointed. there are no english subtitles, so you have no idea what the english translation is effectively making all your learning go down the drain. they throw random words at you, without a translation! it's deceptive and a waste of time. don't bother installing it."
rosettastone,2,0,"the pp is easy to use. however the lessons are long and boring. it's difficult to stay engaged so it can make it difficult to want to learn. also, it will automatically charge you for another subscription even if you don't use it. update after smiling the company i was given a refund. they were incredibly quick and friendly."
rosettastone,2,10,"do domingo. after reaching out to customer service multiple times they pathetically gave a solution to my problem. pp clashes with almost every update or when you refuse to review. while i've learned significant vocabulary, the only real edge this has over similar (free) apes is the speaking portion, however those are often either ridiculously lenient or too strict; pretty ethical that it posters users to review immediately before they get to the important parts of language acquisition."
rosettastone,2,9,the pp doesn't tell you what the phrase is it only shows you the picture as well it won't say the phrase with picture it just says it separately making your brain see a pattern instead of just learning the phrase. i have only learned boy and girl but i dont even know of that's what it is because it could just be man and woman this all because i never was shown the phrases definition and was left to guess.
rosettastone,2,35,"to use the vocal parts of this pp, you must be alien an area devoid of all sound. it pick up every little sound other than voices. i seriously can't use it. i've said the words 30 times in the time it is trying to check me in and it registers that i couldn't properly make the word."
rosettastone,2,2,"this pp is great! it's so fun and makes it really easy to get in to learning a new language! that's what i thought when i finished lesson 1. that thought quickly changed when i went to do lesson 2, the pp would not let me begin the lesson without a charge! download this pp if you want your dreams to be crushed!"
rosettastone,2,1,"remember if it says ""free"" it should be free 🤔 why am i donna be charged after a certain time of use. and be forced to pay $39.00.. na. its ok... i'll just install and couture it for free free.ll"
rosettastone,2,0,"pp requires microphone lessons. mostly fit for people looking to learn the basis of a language quickly, maybe for a trip. decent amount of languages available, but competitors offer a more vast pool and a better complement for language learning."
rosettastone,2,3,i liked it but it clashes on loading page after one used so have to keep installing it. it reaches some words then goes into sentences with the words but at some point leaves out a word to teach in the sentence so have to guess what it is saying than learn
rosettastone,2,9,"the pp still shows reading and grammar questions even i picked ""listening and speaking"" only for my child. moreover it does not show whether it uses the internal or external mid in andros making it hard to debut audit issues. last, but not least, i cannot switch the user interface language."
rosettastone,2,1,i like the language methodology but the pp is utterly useless on a mobile device due to the poor layout and user interface. really unacceptable for such an expensive pp. when i called their teach support they recommended i use it on a computer.
rosettastone,2,5,"learning works well and i'd like to extend my subscription, but 2 stars for the teach. support. i explained the issue in many mails. i provided the screenshots i was supposed to make. i switched the language as i was supposed to. but then just got ignored and received no further response, even after following up from my side."
rosettastone,2,0,"not worth paying for, there are programs that are just as effective but with smaller price tags."
rosettastone,2,2,"voice recognition needs work, i have a fixed 3 and it can't understand me half the time with the earbuds in. it doesn't say my pronunciation is off, just doesn't hear one part, then fine on the next part. very frustration 😡!!"
rosettastone,2,0,not a big fan. the software shouldn't only be pictures. it should be a combination of their current software with spoken definitions. literal objects are easy to learn by guessing. concepts are not.
rosettastone,2,0,so so program turns into aware if you don't continue. technical support really stonewalls about getting rid of the unwanted messages
rosettastone,2,0,"seven words: familiar name/ credit card required / too prices. although roseola stone is an international famous brand, the cost isn't comparable to any of hundreds of hardware-type apes in most any language. i often for a trip of other apes and that was a much better solution, penny-for-penny."
rosettastone,2,6,"i bought the actual roseola, but wanted something mobile. i was disappointed to find that i could not tie my very expensive normal version to the mobile. this seems very wrong to me. what little bit of learning i can do for free i have enjoyed. sadly, grammar is not included so thank goodness i already know how to conjugal german verbs."
rosettastone,2,6,"great language leaving option but way to much money, honestly i prefer domingo purely because it's free and you can complete all courses without paying, with roseola, you can do two or three lessons and then you have to pay £100 a year. it's a money grab and languages should be cheap and or free"
rosettastone,2,16,"it was very good. but today i couldn't open it anymore. i tried several times, even installed and installed, but still couldn't work any more. i just topped up one year membership.l"
rosettastone,2,2,"it didn't have the option to select that or law languages, and when i was routed to the main webster, the webster was nonresponsive."
rosettastone,2,3,the practices seem good and like they would be effective but the pp can never hear me. my dad's native language is what i'm trying to learn and he says the pp didn't recognise when i was saying things correctly.
rosettastone,2,0,"i thought i'd try the french since i was looking for a refreshed. but when doing the basic like ""la filled bit,"" it would not accept my voice... not what i expected."
rosettastone,2,2,"the login doesn't work probably. to use this pp, i have to go through a confusing process - and that's every time i try to use the pp."
rosettastone,2,0,"i started is yesterday for work. i am doing makarin. i started core i unit i and despite having it set on adult male, it doesn't recognize my voice. today, i attempted to re-do core 1 because i didn't do too well on the first try, it now shoots me an error please try again message for all lessons. i have installed and re-installed... i have sent an e-mail to support. i love the pedagogical attempt to learn because i did learn something. can you please help me to resolve this! i am on andros"
rosettastone,2,1,requires me to log in every time i bring the pp to the foreground. doesn't even let me store login credentials in andros's key-chain.
rosettastone,2,0,this pp is great for learning a language if you're willing to pay. it lets you learn one lesson and then locks you out of all the rest of them until you pay up. what's the point of a free pp if it's not free?
rosettastone,2,11,"now i can't do any speaking exercises at all now. it's not picking up my voice. i have remained, treated but i don't get a response."
rosettastone,2,2,it's gets confusing with no actual translations and just pictures. leaves you guessing a lot and not actually learning it properly.
rosettastone,2,1,"works well. annoying asks you to review it all the time, even after you already have (especially irritating since i paid for this). i guess i'll just keep giving different rating."
rosettastone,2,3,"tried the free 30 min discovery, and after an pp switch, the play sound button didn't work anymore on multiple slide/course. when pressing i got a 'not enough memory' but my one plus 3 had like 5 go free of ram.."
rosettastone,2,0,"has a hard time hearing everything i say, with or without headphones, i have to yell for it to recognize me."
rosettastone,2,3,every third pronunciation it doesn't record audit and never works. please fix it.
rosettastone,2,2,"everything was amazing!! except for the fact that you can only get one lesson then have to pay 200$ for the rest of it. really good product, bad prices."
rosettastone,2,1,"not great for learning, audit technology is not great. canceled my subscription on goose play, but then got charged again through their webster, with no way to contact them to get my $80 back."
rosettastone,2,2,disappointed! the andros pp does not have translations. they are only available for is.
rosettastone,2,0,excellent way to learn a language... if you have a native speaker in the room while your using this pp. it lacks the english translation and actual explanation of how the grammar works.
rosettastone,2,0,"it is effective, but i give it two stars for the truaccent thing that they are proud of. it is trash. i say just disabled microphone."
rosettastone,2,1,i was saying the words exactly the same and each time it recorded something different.
rosettastone,2,0,"love this pp, really great. my accent and vocabulary are really improving!"
rosettastone,2,0,"far too expensive. there are many free and unfordable alternatives, very good ones."
rosettastone,2,0,"the prices are insane, best to stick with domingo for now"
rosettastone,2,5,"why can't i create an account? the pp says it has problems with its system and ask to try to later, but through some time the same happens again."
rosettastone,2,2,"this pp is so begged, i click on the subscribe option but nothing load, the loading dots appear and then disappear."
rosettastone,2,0,"i wasn't able to login in to my account on the mobile pp. i have the desktop account which i'm able to login to. please, can ye help me. thank you"
rosettastone,2,2,i love the pp but the breaking rate this pp pop up is driving me nuts. i pay for this not to have stupid pop up!
rosettastone,2,0,"seriously i was doing the free trial of roseola stone and did the first few course in changes/makarin. due it explains nothing! in other languages that would be ok i bet it reaches the latin languages very well, but makarin is a total language. you cannot speak it correctly if you don't use the right tone. hour is slap, hour is ugly hour is sticky. so chinese people do not even understand what you say! if you're learning chinese there is better. i'd try you mandirin, it's really good."
rosettastone,2,0,after i forgot something it wouldn't let me do it again even though i used the rest button.
rosettastone,2,15,wasted half n hour trying to complete lesson one only to find out that i must pay to progress. would gave been better to know before i wasted half n hour. although it was great there are apes out there such as do lingo that give the option to pay to clock all lessons but if u choose not to you can clock them for free by processing which is a satisfying reward scheme.
rosettastone,2,0,i hate the fact that it just gives in and just assumes that we know the language already in the first lesson.
rosettastone,2,0,"[french] sorry it's too deep from beginning. i don't even know what is it, i don't how to choose how to use, i won't buy this. i got a better experience with top 1 pp. 1 more star for your system."
rosettastone,2,0,nothing free here trial period 3 days and automatically bills you from goose play.. sick
rosettastone,2,0,seems like it would be a good way to learn i've heard many good things but i would like to learn sign language and it is not an option sadly.
rosettastone,2,2,confusing. just pictures and the program saying words. you have to guess what each one is
rosettastone,2,39,good pp but you have to pay to have access to 95% of the material so no no sorry
rosettastone,2,0,"3 days trial then dish out $100 sorry but that $100 goes towards living expenses i'm sure i can find a 'seriously' more unfordable pp like this that single incomes can afford, we all aren't made out of money a know."
rosettastone,2,2,the program left me confused as to what some of the pictures were trying to pair up with the words or phrases through out the syllabus. in the end i was using goose translate to clarify what i was trying to learn. i'm up to level 14 and i dont feel any more confident in speaking french. on the plus side i have learnt a lot of words but unfortunately did'it reach my goal to speak it conversational.
rosettastone,2,0,can't get past lesson 1 without crashing. i learned hold and that's all it's good for.
rosettastone,2,3,"i like the idea of using context to learn, however this is just not helpful when the language uses different alphabet as your own. i have a terribly hard time speaking sentences in first based on hearing. i need a reference to read from as i forget the phrase i am supposed to repeat. the reference is written in first, but i have no idea how to read it, and honestly would prefer learning the speaking part."
rosettastone,2,1,$17 a month? no thanks.
rosettastone,2,0,"it's ok, they teach you the words but they don't say what they mean ink if it's just me but it doesn't really tell me what the words mean but just show pictures which could sometimes be hard to understand what it could mean."
rosettastone,2,2,this was a great way for me to learn languages. but why do you have to pay for more lessons.
rosettastone,2,0,if there is a free trial to convince me to join with you it would be better. otherwise i can't rate you and i can't pay 😅 okay i already installed your pp and i couldn't find any other subscriptions so please may you help me ☺
rosettastone,2,0,it worked but than it just got really confusing to me please make it better and write back.
rosettastone,2,0,i don't understand why it scores you on how accurate the accent is when you speak. why should that matter as long as the person understands what i'm saying?
rosettastone,2,2,only 24 languages available. that is not one of them
rosettastone,2,0,only a few lessons before needing to pay which was disappointing
rosettastone,2,0,although it's a really good pp it makes you pay aft we're r so long but i should have expected that
rosettastone,2,7,"tried the ""dont see a language you like, let us know"" button. and filled out the information needed. it won't even let me submit it. therefore the pp is useless to anyone that wants a language other than what is offered"
rosettastone,2,0,i enjoy learning english here
rosettastone,2,0,cannot change language option
rosettastone,2,1,stopped working after one minute of use.
rosettastone,2,0,how to refund? i didn't notice that it cost automatically after period and i never want to study organ because i am from more. i didn't use this pp except first time for curiosity. ply let me know how to refund :(
rosettastone,2,0,i can't even log in for some reason
rosettastone,2,0,it's ok but better out there 4 sure
rosettastone,2,0,they go way too fast. barely gives you time to actually learn what they're saying
rosettastone,2,0,i bet its amazing but i can't afford it because i don't have the money for it (it's $94.99 a month)
rosettastone,2,0,"terrible teach support, crazy prices"
rosettastone,2,0,"just jumped straight into it, i didn't see an alphabet or anything."
rosettastone,2,0,"very little for free, don't waste your time! you won't learn to much."
rosettastone,2,0,hold it is amazing i am learning a lot ladies. we have to buy stuff
rosettastone,2,0,the voice recognition is a 💩 emboli.
rosettastone,2,0,reduce ask size and update german
rosettastone,2,0,the pp went to fast to learn
rosettastone,2,0,dont know if it actually would help me speak spanish bluntly
rosettastone,2,0,i hate the fact that we have to make an account for this pp.
rosettastone,2,0,how do you close the pp?
