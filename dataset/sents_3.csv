duolingo,3,0,its good but it moves at a very slow pace.
duolingo,3,0,it's not challenging enough.
duolingo,3,0,it keeps enforcing basic vocabulary using baby sentences while occasionally adding new words.
duolingo,3,0,"it's also clot of multiple choice which helps you choose the right answer by eliminating the obvious wrong answers, which makes it too easy and doesn help me learn."
duolingo,3,0,they need less multiple choice and more speaking without words on screen.
duolingo,3,0,that would make it more challenging and more like learning a language in the real world.
duolingo,3,455,"domingo is good for vocabulary, but it offers absolutely no explanation on grammar."
duolingo,3,455,"while taking the spanish placement test (i intended to use the pp to help maintain my knowledge of the language), it appeared to believe that the present and the present progressive tense were the same, which they absolutely are not!"
duolingo,3,455,"while this pp may be useful for vocabulary, i absolutely will not be using it after seeing that mix-up with the grammar."
duolingo,3,1,i'm thinking of quitting do after using it pretty heavily and i'll tell you why.
duolingo,3,1,"it has a reward-based motivation system, which is great, but your reward is not proportional to your effort."
duolingo,3,1,"when you reach high levels, the levels are harder and harder to complete and take longer but the up reward per unit doesn't go up so it gets harder and harder to compete with people who are bruising through new languages."
duolingo,3,1,it gets frustration and i'm not sure i want to do it much longer.
duolingo,3,0,great for learning romance languages.
duolingo,3,0,but i'm trying to brush up on my japanese and its not the best.
duolingo,3,0,made me start with the basis because the test had so much anti i didn't know.
duolingo,3,0,"starting with the basis is fine when you know what the hirigana is already and can speak and listen fine, but if you try to learn this as a new learner, its pretty rough."
duolingo,3,1,i really love this pp.
duolingo,3,1,i have been wanting to learn scottish garlic for years and have tried some of the other resources available online but not gotten too far because there isn't as much interactivity with them so this has been great for that.
duolingo,3,1,the only reason it has 3 stars is quite frequently it doesn't record that a lesson has already been done so it is just a case of getting the same ones over and over.
duolingo,3,1,"normally happens on a monday starting a new league ü•∫ besides this, amazing pp üòä"
duolingo,3,16,"this pp is great to expose you to new words, however, i wouldn't recommend only relying on it to teach you a language."
duolingo,3,16,some recommendations: 1) there is no word bank so i had to write everything down.
duolingo,3,16,"2)i also wish that they had character tracing for the mobile version, especially for asia characters where stroke order matters."
duolingo,3,16,3) recently i've had to type a lot of words.
duolingo,3,16,"i've found that do isn't all that forgiving of types or different wording, but i appreciate the report option."
duolingo,3,1,the hearts ruined this pp.
duolingo,3,1,it really hinders learning when you are forced to stop because you mistyped a couple of words.
duolingo,3,1,"it gives you the option to refill your hearts for gems, well now i did that and lost all my gems and the hearts did not refill!"
duolingo,3,1,get rid of the hearts and this would make a wonderful learning tool.
duolingo,3,0,it worked fine until i updated it today.
duolingo,3,0,"now, the up isn't being added as i do lessons, the skill i finished isn't shown finished (i tried twice, completed it but it still shows 5/7 lessons done), my result in the league isn't changing, i gained 0 up for doing a test."
duolingo,3,0,"please fix, i've got a league to win!"
duolingo,3,2,some languages are designed well - japanese.
duolingo,3,2,"others, like organ, seem to have been designed by a teenager only interested in talking about boy bands/ girl bands... seriously, skin all logical vocabulary and into sentences and go straight into ""that singer is not cool. """
duolingo,3,2,please design organ so it makes sense.
duolingo,3,0,streamlined interface.
duolingo,3,0,adjective features.
duolingo,3,0,"learning chinese, i enjoy the incremental vocabulary and systematic sentences."
duolingo,3,0,"i'm disappointed that we must learn the sounds of characters before their meanings, which often inspire their shape."
duolingo,3,0,i'm also ambivalent that one can get perfect scores with very floppy studying.
duolingo,3,0,this pp works fine without having the adds removed.
duolingo,3,0,they're more option online which is convenient if you have the time.
duolingo,3,0,"i am using it for japanese and i have only found one translation errors ""excuse me, i am an apple."""
duolingo,3,0,unless that's a popular saying in japan?
duolingo,3,0,i wish they added a voice recognition to practice saying the words/symbols/ and sentences.
duolingo,3,0,other then that i work on it two hours a day and repeat a lot of the lessons and i think it's great üòä
duolingo,3,0,i am very disappointed after second time it happened since started using domingo a month ago that after completing all lessons on a level of the topic and given the afar that i have reached next level the software all the sudden decided without any explanation that i did not.
duolingo,3,0,second time i lost not one but two lessons and basically i am forced to take them again to get the level completed.
duolingo,3,0,very frustration that my time and effort were wasted.
duolingo,3,0,"the team, this application is the first one i've invested a lot of time and money in."
duolingo,3,0,"i really believe that it works; but i would have subscribed to a yearly subscription this time, unfortunately the amount got deduced and i couldn't remove auto payment."
duolingo,3,0,also it cost me more for a short period.
duolingo,3,0,please look into the matter as i would've wanted to pay for the coming year.
duolingo,3,0,"a big fan, push"
duolingo,3,1,i'm sure this pp has potential bit english to organ is really bad.
duolingo,3,1,my husband is organ and i wanted to learn some.
duolingo,3,1,and he says the translations are awkward and not how you would say it.
duolingo,3,1,"i also think it's ridiculous how you go from learning letters to full sentences, no bridge between."
duolingo,3,1,no vocabulary.
duolingo,3,1,and the few words it does teach you is not informed in any way.
duolingo,3,1,i'm sure this works fine between languages that you can translate word for word.
duolingo,3,1,will delete and find simpler pp.
duolingo,3,0,it is quite good for begins.
duolingo,3,0,i would like to say that i would like it to be a bit more easy.
duolingo,3,0,"yes, creating an account is pretty easy (and free) but i feel like it's stupid to be required to make an account in order to learn more (especially if all it is is as and/or unnecessary features)."
duolingo,3,0,still recommended.
duolingo,3,0,3/5 ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üíîüíî.
duolingo,3,1,domingo is a great pp to learn languages but it is not complete so you don't find every language you are looking for.
duolingo,3,1,"also the listening exercises don't work after the last update and i don't hear anything, please fix this problem."
duolingo,3,1,otherwise it is really great and if didn't have these issues i would give a five star.
duolingo,3,5,i pay and subscribe so that tells you quite a lot.
duolingo,3,5,"however, after an (old) update, provided comments, but received no response from developer, i am a little disappointed with their customer engagement."
duolingo,3,5,"... ... old comment : ""i can no longer see how many words i've learnt this month, (and the previous month's either) also, where are the little graph of progress etc ""what were you thinking""?"
duolingo,3,5,"...... please bring back those features"""
duolingo,3,6,"love it, but i couldn't give it 5 stars."
duolingo,3,6,"the ""hearts"" system is awful, and i absolutely hate it!"
duolingo,3,6,i have to wait 5 hours for hearts to go up back just because i made a mistake.
duolingo,3,6,absolutely hate this feature and it should been take out sap.
duolingo,3,6,it really takes away from the enjoyment of learning
duolingo,3,6,"i've been using this pp for over two months without a single issue and i find absolutely amazing, since progress is truly made and i actually am learning."
duolingo,3,6,"problem is, last update destroyed it."
duolingo,3,6,"laws all the time, while tapping on things, writing text or twitching between the pages (accepting settings or the leaderboard)."
duolingo,3,6,"even the andros are played slow or completely asyncronous, sometimes they play when the screen still has to recognize that i tapped on ""continue""."
duolingo,3,6,it is barely unable.
duolingo,3,6,fix it.
duolingo,3,1,great pp.
duolingo,3,1,very easy learning.
duolingo,3,1,"however, it doesn't let you create multiple profile under one account."
duolingo,3,1,i'm trying to create separate profile for my two kiss on two different devices but it keeps reverting to one profile on both devices!
duolingo,3,1,surely this couldn't be a difficult option to build into the pp?
duolingo,3,24,"the pp is quite robust and well planned; however, the developer does not respond to feedback."
duolingo,3,24,i have sample several courses.
duolingo,3,24,some familiar and some unfamiliar.
duolingo,3,24,some courses contain into without explanation while others seem quite accurate.
duolingo,3,24,"overall, i have enjoyed using the pp; however, i will not spend my money on an pp whose developer does not interact with its community."
duolingo,3,24,i chose three stars as i believe it is possible to learn from mistakes yet not without appropriate feedback.
duolingo,3,0,"i love this pp, it makes learning easy."
duolingo,3,0,but it's easier to understand the italian than the pp.
duolingo,3,0,why does running out of the hearts stop the lesson?
duolingo,3,0,where do the hearts come from in the first place?
duolingo,3,0,i really don't get it???
duolingo,3,0,maybe i'm just too old.
duolingo,3,0,"i would like to review lessons to practice but can't figure out how to, or indeed if it's possible."
duolingo,3,0,there is little or no guidance how navigable the course.
duolingo,3,0,"i'll keep at it and hope i get the best from it, but i can't help thinking i'm missing bits out."
duolingo,3,1,"all in all, this is a good pp for learning a language."
duolingo,3,1,"however, the recent update that added people characters in the lessons drives me crazy."
duolingo,3,1,"i've also set modifications as a reminder to do my lessons for a certain time, and i get modifications at all hours of the day, so that's a little annoying."
duolingo,3,2,"it would be more, realistic if they allowed month to month membership."
duolingo,3,2,i dislike the all or nothing feeling.
duolingo,3,2,"it irs me that the as claim to be to help everyone learn for free, yet they don't have a pay plan for those of us who are on fixed incomes, and are striving to change that."
duolingo,3,2,newsflash domingo... not everyone who uses this pp is so wealthy they can afford to give you a year up front...& not everyone who uses this pp is so dirt poor that free is the only answer.
duolingo,3,2,get flexible please.
duolingo,3,36,"i loved the domingo pp on my samson galaxy s, until...i progressed to the second level and started getting 'fill in the blank' questions."
duolingo,3,36,"unfortunately, the pp would freeze, not access my keyboard."
duolingo,3,36,i couldn't type in an answer.
duolingo,3,36,i couldn't skin to the next question.
duolingo,3,36,"my only option was to exit the lesson, which meant not getting credit for work i'd already done rendering the pp unable for further lessons."
duolingo,3,36,"i can only use the webster, even though i paid for domingo plus."
duolingo,3,36,still happening!
duolingo,3,0,in my opinion this is a great pp to learn languages.
duolingo,3,0,but there is something you should add to help others.
duolingo,3,0,you should add the language alphabet for each of them.
duolingo,3,0,and you should also add the pronunciation.
duolingo,3,0,but other than that this is an amazing pp!
duolingo,3,1,"domingo is great but the pp is not, i really don't understand why the grammar explanations that are available on the webster are not available on the pp."
duolingo,3,1,and that is what everybody criticism is about: the lack of explanations.
duolingo,3,1,that is why i use domingo on their mobile webpage so i can access the introduction to each lesson.
duolingo,3,0,"1/11/2020 enjoying the program so far for the most part, but i don't love the ""guessing game"" vice."
duolingo,3,0,"they really don't teach you words, they just throw them in and you have to figure out what exactly they mean, all of their consolations, and grammatical uses on your own."
duolingo,3,0,"i'm definitely liking this program as a flash introductory type thing, but i think i'll be looking elsewhere to round out my studies later on."
duolingo,3,0,:)
duolingo,3,11,it's good but has flaws.
duolingo,3,11,"i feel with some languages, it jumps far too deep or fast (chinese) but with others it takes it time (arabic and japanese)."
duolingo,3,11,"with some languages, you can practice saying the phrases (chinese and french) but with others, it doesn't (arabic and japanese)."
duolingo,3,11,"ü§î it offers so many languages like hawaiian, naval and even made up languages like clinton and high valyrian... but it doesn't offer all the most spoken languages (top 10 in the world) like bengal üòï."
duolingo,3,0,it keeps putting me in office mode.
duolingo,3,0,my internet and data both work fine.
duolingo,3,0,and everytime i finish a lesson it changes what level i'm on.
duolingo,3,0,i got to level four and then it took me back to level three so i finished a part of level three and it rest me back to the beginning of level three again?
duolingo,3,0,i'm making no progress.
duolingo,3,230,two issues.
duolingo,3,230,"first, if you use earphones, forget about it."
duolingo,3,230,"i use several pair, each of which works well for voice input, but voice input for domingo just doesn't work 9/10 input."
duolingo,3,230,you press the button to speak the answer and it just cuts you off and stops listening.
duolingo,3,230,the major problem is that you cannot use the pp in landscape.
duolingo,3,230,well you can with other apes.
duolingo,3,230,that result in answers being ordered correctly for you.
duolingo,3,230,so you can cheat.
duolingo,3,230,just support landscape and don't tell me how to use my phone.
duolingo,3,13,"i like the content of the pp, but i don't like the ""game"" format."
duolingo,3,13,"i download the pp to learn, which inevitably involves getting things wrong, particularly when trying to remember the correct verbs."
duolingo,3,13,"i'm finding it frustration that i can't simply continue to work through the sessions simply because i've run out of ""lives""."
duolingo,3,0,"for learning english, this pp has the option - learn english from hind."
duolingo,3,0,and therefore the working and learning environment is completely in hind.
duolingo,3,0,though hind is our mother tongue but working on an application in hind is quite problematical.
duolingo,3,0,so please just add one more option for learning english but with the help of english environment.
duolingo,3,0,hope you people understand what i mean.
duolingo,3,0,rest of the things are absolutely fine!üòä
duolingo,3,0,looking internet connection during lesson may result in not being able to finish the lesson or rollback entire progress made in that day.
duolingo,3,0,refreshing leader board /etc on demand most of the times does not work.
duolingo,3,0,daily less reminders want you to start gaining points while you made a lot of them several hours ago.
duolingo,3,0,animation works 50/50.
duolingo,3,0,special points - lights doesn't have almost any use case.
duolingo,3,0,"not every lesson has ability to add comment, some are closed, threads have useless comments charlimit.."
duolingo,3,0,"i would give you 5 stars but the environment you designed for is is better that the one for andros, if you improve the andros one maybe, maybe i would give you the 5 stars and pay the plus subscription."
duolingo,3,0,"update: as soon as i wrote the previous comment the pp changed to an is like environment, don't know how, i didn't download an update and i don't let the device do it on its own!"
duolingo,3,0,"so... very strange, right?"
duolingo,3,0,now i am taking down another star because the speaking exercises are annoying.
duolingo,3,0,great pp.
duolingo,3,0,i am learning german.
duolingo,3,0,edit : i am having issues with my pp recently.
duolingo,3,0,my internet connection is perfectly fine yet it's failing to connect to the internet.
duolingo,3,0,everything was good until a couple of days ago before i updated the pp to the latest version.
duolingo,3,0,the hearts (that you use to practice) don't continue to charge unless you open the pp again.
duolingo,3,0,left pp alone for 13 hours thinking i would have almost 3 hearts to practice with but i only had one.
duolingo,3,0,clicked the hearts to see the time... started counting down 5 hours.. please fix the refill period of the hearts.
duolingo,3,3,"i love the pp, as i move around a lot."
duolingo,3,3,i also pay for plus.
duolingo,3,3,"unfortunately i cannot 5-star, because there are no links to the explanations that the desktop has."
duolingo,3,3,they're really descriptive and are super helpful for learning nice rules.
duolingo,3,3,"if they get added in, it'll be instant 5-star."
duolingo,3,0,"overlay good but the education the pp puts under a user is too much (speaking of leagues and what not ) i hope that a ""take break"" option gets added so it actually gives the user some temporary rest or it will turn from a healthy habit to an addition"
duolingo,3,0,good to help with pronunciation.
duolingo,3,0,practice are mind rubbing repetition.
duolingo,3,0,points are taken away for small errors such as incorrect identification of gender as for major errors such as incorrect verbs.
duolingo,3,0,for favor in just about every sentence.
duolingo,3,0,i had points taken away because i forgot to include it or because i had a major type
duolingo,3,0,"a lot of bags (i have samson galaxy 70 and on my do version when you choose / click on the word buttons they disappear or appear twice,so i have to start over which now costs a huge bunch of gems) free version is literally disappointing as gems-gems-gems are needed for most actions + 5 hearts each day"
duolingo,3,0,i like it so far... but i can't do anything because it won't let me sign in!
duolingo,3,0,"i keep trying to sign in, but it will load for ten minutes and do nothing."
duolingo,3,0,i won't be able to save my progress if i can't sign in.
duolingo,3,0,only just started but feel i've learned a lot in a short space of time.
duolingo,3,0,whilst using pp i find english text on phone doesn't show accents etc on the french words which pp doesn't recognize hence it's 'wrong'.
duolingo,3,0,must try and remedy that.
duolingo,3,0,apart from that it's very good
duolingo,3,7,i find the translations are very canned and it makes me wonder if the french sentences are equally face sounding.
duolingo,3,7,the way you ha e to write out the english translation is a very literal translation and it doesn't sound like anything anyone would ever say.
duolingo,3,7,it worries me that i'm learning equally awkward phrases in french.
duolingo,3,7,find that i am enjoying learning french with this pp.
duolingo,3,7,looking forward to improving my french a lot however for the last month there is a problem with the practice section as it is marking an answer as incorrect but then it shows the correct answer and mine was the correct answer.
duolingo,3,7,it has locked down and i cannot use that section as a learning tool which is unfortunate to say the least.
duolingo,3,7,i really enjoyed learning with domingo but the should do their jobs and fix bags.
duolingo,3,7,will apply for a refund
duolingo,3,0,"it was great for the longest time, minus the grammar mix up with tense."
duolingo,3,0,"now, it won't let me choose another course and doesn't process my progress."
duolingo,3,0,please fix it!
duolingo,3,0,"has been pretty good so far, but please add an option to disabled these new images of people next to the sentence i'm supposed to translate."
duolingo,3,0,it is very distracting to me.
duolingo,3,0,it seems like the content is very repetition especially the st level.
duolingo,3,0,it is difficult to use the a on my phone.
duolingo,3,0,i dont like having to type the english translation.
duolingo,3,0,this is not the easiest or most fun pp i have used.
duolingo,3,0,i'm not a fan of the most recent update that forces you to use lights to advance/test out.
duolingo,3,0,the rewards for users could be better.
duolingo,3,0,there's zero incentive to want to continue.
duolingo,3,0,the new stories are the only fun lessening addition.
duolingo,3,1,please remove the health system!!!
duolingo,3,1,"i use this quite clot to learn polish however i find that the lives are very annoying, yes it's a way to buy premium but i want to learn!"
duolingo,3,1,i have to wait ages for a new life and i just want to continue learning and see what my mistakes are!
duolingo,3,1,it's very good but the lives are very unnecessary!
duolingo,3,2,it's good and way helpful but when i connect my earphones the audit starts getting begged either it doesn't speak the full sentence or speaks in a way which can't be understood as good as in speaker mode :/ i got viper4android installed may be that's cause the issue ?
duolingo,3,2,but event after disabling that pp it doesn't solve the compression of audit ain't that good
duolingo,3,0,"pp is made good, it's fun to learn language."
duolingo,3,0,that's the good thing.
duolingo,3,0,the bad thing: it has a lot of mistakes in lessons.
duolingo,3,0,many people have reported about these mistakes for more than a year already.
duolingo,3,0,and nobody cares to fix them still.
duolingo,3,0,that's really irritating.
duolingo,3,0,"there are tons of sentences which have been broken for years, multiple users have submitted ""my answer should have been accepted"" reports, but still broken... also it's 2020, time for dark mode üåö"
duolingo,3,1,i like how they make it a game.
duolingo,3,1,"the bad thing is that if you're already at an advanced level, the pp still makes you start at the beginning level."
duolingo,3,1,i got every answer right on the placement test but it won't put me in an advanced level.
duolingo,3,2,"good for hearing pronunciation and learning a small vocabulary, but it reaches no grammar that would be helpful for extrapolating beyond the basis."
duolingo,3,2,the interface is also petty childish with lots of littlegroggy interruption telling you what a good boy/girl you are.
duolingo,3,2,more annoying than the as by far.
duolingo,3,5,5 stars if you make a setting where the domingo bird actually says threatening or angry motivation blurs.
duolingo,3,5,"also, please make the achievement card photo in the achievement tax smaller."
duolingo,3,5,"specifically, make them shorter."
duolingo,3,5,combating everything in that tax would look a lot nicer.
duolingo,3,0,"i've used this pp before and it was pretty good, but i got a new phone and had to download the pp."
duolingo,3,0,i kept trying to log back in using my email but it kept saying there was an error.
duolingo,3,0,tried downloading it again and it's still not working.
duolingo,3,0,i will give it 3 stars because i learned basis of german just in 2 days but now the sounds in the listening exercises aren't coming so i have to skin it moreover earlier when i pressed any word it used to pronounce it for me which helped a lot but it has stopped i don't know why it happened but ply help me i really like this pp .
duolingo,3,0,there are some issues in listening/speaking practices and pronouncing 2-part words .
duolingo,3,0,sometimes there is no voice in listening tasks and i have no choice to skin it.
duolingo,3,0,that's the only problem i find in this beautiful pp üëåüòç
duolingo,3,0,"the audit in listening exercises is not working, also when selecting an answer it doesn read it, while the sound when u answer correctly can be heard."
duolingo,3,0,i have the pp and the issue is not solved in the latest update.
duolingo,3,0,great pp!
duolingo,3,0,i've been learning a language and its going pretty well.
duolingo,3,0,"i just hope that they add filipino/tagalog so i can learn it because in in the philippines and i know very little of it, i hope the developer of this pp listens and adds it."
duolingo,3,0,the pp is fun and easy to use but there is one symbol in the hind language that matches with the letters through the entire lesson then says its incorrect when u match it during the test so i've had to keep testing out since it will not let me pass the test there and i'm missing information in the process
duolingo,3,0,after few weeks the sound doesn work.
duolingo,3,0,"there was no problem at first , but now, the parts that should be pronounced doesn work ."
duolingo,3,0,so i can hear anything.
duolingo,3,0,"i gave this pp 3 stars because the original language i wanted to learn, isn't on the pp."
duolingo,3,0,am guessing it will be on the one you have to pay for.
duolingo,3,0,"so s a bit disappointed....it is a really good pp though, very easy to learn."
duolingo,3,0,the hearts put pressure on you to get it right though.
duolingo,3,0,"i loved the pp, but without paying for plus, i kept losing my hearts so it got boring having to keep using practice, so only after 2 days i paid for plus."
duolingo,3,0,please change this in the future.
duolingo,3,1,hearts are really bad for blind people.
duolingo,3,1,"although it's an overall easy-to-use pp for blind people, they tend to do more mistakes simply by mistaking and it makes it impossible to learn."
duolingo,3,1,the pp should be more fair to everyone.
duolingo,3,1,no one likes these hearts anyway..
duolingo,3,0,so many duplicate answers while learning japanese while only one of them is good.
duolingo,3,0,makes it impossible to go through many lessons as you are faced with 1/2 chances of looking a heart everytime you come by such questions.
duolingo,3,0,"i was happy to pay for this pp after using the free version, but was disappointed that the 7.99/th subscription was actually not monthly, they deduced a full yearly subscription at once."
duolingo,3,0,guess i'll learn a few languages this year!
duolingo,3,0,!
duolingo,3,0,it's awesome......but that health bar needs go sap....dying to learn indonesian language but when u run out of health...with doesn't make sense at all u have to stop..and if u dont have any gems..u have to pay!....how is that free!
duolingo,3,0,?
duolingo,3,0,very good free learning pp but the web version is better.
duolingo,3,0,also currently experiencing a bug that doesn't let me backspace my type answers unless i tap the text box again.
duolingo,3,0,"i love domingo and have been using it for a couple years now casually and my spanish is intermediate, which is awesome as someone not actively learning and definitely a hell of a lot more than i learned in school."
duolingo,3,0,"but this new update in really not a fan of, the hearts overall?"
duolingo,3,0,i'm not going to spend money to buy more- in going to go to another pp.
duolingo,3,0,"i really hope they update again and get rid of that feature, i like going through multiple old lessons and this 5 strikes and you're out is not it"
duolingo,3,0,the pp is good in teaching i give you that.
duolingo,3,0,but the practice mode takes too time to load and wouldn't load at all in some times without closing the pp multiple times.
duolingo,3,0,please fix.
duolingo,3,0,:<
duolingo,3,0,very good pp although i'd prefer to learn spanish for spain rather than for mexico.
duolingo,3,0,it's c not th in domingo spanish - when i go to spain i'll need gracious with a th sound not the c reinforced by do.
duolingo,3,0,would prefer a variation which allows me to practise the th sound.
duolingo,3,0,my review is for the mobile version alone.
duolingo,3,0,it is conceptual good and can teach the basis at the very least.
duolingo,3,0,"however, it falls short on several points: 1. the tips doesn't cover what is in the skill."
duolingo,3,0,"furthermore, the tips aren't show at the beginning."
duolingo,3,0,"to fix this, it is suggested to give the tips at the first level and lesson of each skill."
duolingo,3,0,the bell button should be for reviews.
duolingo,3,0,"2. the league leaderboard may not be synchronised, i had more up gained in that day but others are ranged higher."
duolingo,3,0,the pp is great.
duolingo,3,0,"there is lots of variety, and it is fun to play."
duolingo,3,0,the 3 star is only because the avert in the free version are constant and annoying.
duolingo,3,0,works really well.
duolingo,3,0,and i'm learning a lot!
duolingo,3,0,i'm learning portuguese and it is being very helpful.
duolingo,3,0,the only thing about it that i don't like is the fact that sometimes it doesn't pronounce the words like they are supposed to be pronounced.
duolingo,3,0,"pp is pretty great, but their irish course is lacking of so many things."
duolingo,3,0,they just give you words without telling how to construct a sentence and we have no idea how to pronounce things.
duolingo,3,0,should really upgrade their irish course.
duolingo,3,0,i love this pp!!
duolingo,3,0,it's an amazing pp if you want to learn a new language.
duolingo,3,0,"i'd give it 5 stars if there was an option to just look at everything you've learned so far, so you can revise."
duolingo,3,0,your pp does not work well and so slow the story part is slow too.
duolingo,3,0,after finishing each story it 's stopped.
duolingo,3,0,its pronunciation does not work either.
duolingo,3,0,so i have started using the pp and i can only use it for as long as i have hearts.
duolingo,3,0,each mistake costs me a heart.
duolingo,3,0,each day i have 3 hearts.
duolingo,3,0,so i cannot make any progress because of this.
duolingo,3,0,of course i will do least 3 mistakes when learning a new language.
duolingo,3,0,"now, all my friends have the same pp installed and they don't have any hearts and can use it for as long as they want."
duolingo,3,0,"i can get unlimited hearts only by paying 300ron, which is not ok since all my friends use it for free."
duolingo,3,0,please add the ability to use the keyboard to do the exercises.
duolingo,3,0,"forcing me to use word banks means i don't learn anything, and subsequently, repeatedly install the pp and use the desktop version instead."
duolingo,3,0,when i first started i was learning but as things got rougher i started struggling to understand why certain phrases are used and why.
duolingo,3,0,then i'd use all my stars trying to figure things out i'd get discouraged finally i just quit playing.
duolingo,3,0,if this pp had some short tutoring video it would help.
duolingo,3,0,when you're struggling to learn and it shows you're competing against other people you dont know and you drop 10-15 places it kills the moral of learning .
duolingo,3,0,the pp just wasn't what i was hoping for.
duolingo,3,0,"it was great pp till i upgrade it and it became terrible, it slowed down my phone and doesn't work."
duolingo,3,0,hope you can fix it cause it's nice pp for learning.
duolingo,3,5,"regarding french, this is, overall, a good pp, but it can be totally infuriating at times."
duolingo,3,5,"example: when do asks you to translate an interrogative, like 'do you want some apples?'"
duolingo,3,5,there are multiple correct answers.
duolingo,3,5,"but when you answer, 'voulez-vous des hommes?'"
duolingo,3,5,"the pp can score your answer as wrong, saying that you should have answered instead, 'vous voulez des hommes.'"
duolingo,3,5,"the pp should recognize both answers as correct, the former even more because it doesn't rely on infection."
duolingo,3,0,pp is fairly good however i believe that they should have more language like lingual for example.
duolingo,3,0,why is it that most of the language that you can lean are either the popular ones or the languages you can lean at school?
duolingo,3,0,"this is by far the worst update i've ever installed, it keeps crashing and delete the level i was working on as if i haven't answered any question in it."
duolingo,3,20,"so this pp is very helpful and fun, however if you choose not to watch the as for the free version the pp starts all over again from the beginning."
duolingo,3,20,"it's sort of annoying, so if you get answers incorrect after a certain number you run out of hearts and then you start from the beginning if you chose to not watch the as."
duolingo,3,20,"it's a little repetition as well but that's common, with learning another language."
duolingo,3,20,just watch the as in case you miss some answers.
duolingo,3,0,this pp would have been awarded 5 stars had it given the learner a way to connect and communicate with other earners more efficiently.
duolingo,3,0,"when i growled a way to speak to a fellow japanese student, the answer presented by domingo was ""you can, however, click on someone's name/icon to go to their profile (or ""stream"" as domingo calls it) and post a message to them there."""
duolingo,3,0,this statement is false.
duolingo,3,0,please provide gratification to those of us wanting to communicate.
duolingo,3,3,i wish i could give 5 stars but i can.
duolingo,3,3,i love the pp the only thing i dont like is you have to pay for all your months up front.
duolingo,3,3,they tell you how much it is monthly but when you click on it to pay they charge you all at once.
duolingo,3,3,"other than that, i like it."
duolingo,3,3,oh and i wish they would give you more than 5 hearts and not take one everytime you make a mistake.
duolingo,3,3,after all we are learning here.
duolingo,3,3,üòò
duolingo,3,19,"i really like the pp, makes learning fun and easy."
duolingo,3,19,my only issue is now you have 5 hearts and if you run out you have to wait to continue learning.
duolingo,3,19,i just would like to be able to learn a language without having obstacles.
duolingo,3,19,"would love for the pp to just go back to letting people learn without losing lives or whatnot... i'm not here trying to play facebook games, just to learn!"
duolingo,3,34,i appreciate that the a is free.
duolingo,3,34,you can pay to get as removed.
duolingo,3,34,domingo needs improvement to keep my interest.
duolingo,3,34,when you get something wrong there is no explanation of the rules or why it's wrong.
duolingo,3,34,you're just told the right answer.
duolingo,3,34,that's not very helpful for me.
duolingo,3,34,you're often expected to spell words in a foreign language that you may have only seen once if at all.
duolingo,3,34,"you feel set up to fail, which needs into the loss of hearts mechanics keeping your lesson from going on."
duolingo,3,34,too many modifications.
duolingo,3,6,i really enjoy the pp but the constant changes to the japanese course are annoying.
duolingo,3,6,"at one point, the pp had those japanese writing exercises and they were amazing."
duolingo,3,6,unfortunately they only lasted for a very short period.
duolingo,3,6,there should be some anti writing exercises too.
duolingo,3,6,japanese courses are often too simple.
duolingo,3,6,"there might be just two option for the right answer and the sentence order exercises have only the words one should use, even when there're three words in the sentence."
duolingo,3,0,really awesome don't like the commercial running out of stars on the free pp is a pain have to wait till the next day so you can continue otherwise it's awesome
duolingo,3,0,"i would consider the pp another tool to accompany more dedicated study, but for some easy practice on the go, it's a solid pp."
duolingo,3,0,"turning learning into a game with achievements, levels, and a bit of competition really helps get you into it, and it allows you to learn around your schedule or availability."
duolingo,3,0,"also, true to it's reputation, it is pretty good at sending you modifications and reminders."
duolingo,3,0,this is good or bad depending on how you look at it.
duolingo,3,0,"overall, it's a fun and easy to use."
duolingo,3,14,"i enjoy learning with this, but a recent update has practically accelerated the breaking of eggs."
duolingo,3,14,i don't have a lot of time for this and i'm now spending all of it on previous lessons.
duolingo,3,14,"i understand why it's important, but i can't learn new things if i'm constantly backtracking and only able to do a new lesson once a week at best."
duolingo,3,14,"please either adjust this, or make the ""strengthen"" exercise useful by having it fix all broken eggs."
duolingo,3,14,or any for that matter.
duolingo,3,0,this pp is very good and i really enjoy it but i dont know why i have no audit and can hear anything.
duolingo,3,0,this makes me disappointed in learning foreign language.
duolingo,3,0,"i would like more visual prompt, more opportunities to converse/speak, and an index with words to insert into sentence structures that i've learned."
duolingo,3,0,"ok so this pp is really nice and i like that it reaches you stuff for free, but ever since they put that ""you only have 5 hearts"" thing it's not enjoyable anymore, i'm learning russian and it's really hard for me to make no mistakes i would rate full stars but the heart thing is ridiculous, oh and you have to wait hours to get your hearts back, but besides all of that, it's really helpful would recommend"
duolingo,3,0,"great pp except the have a link to a ""free trial"" of premium but selecting only gives you the option to pay, no real free trial"
duolingo,3,5,so far so good with the learning.
duolingo,3,5,i understand that the free version will serve me as and i'm quite happy to see them.
duolingo,3,5,what i don't like is how the pp is clearly accepting data from other apes on my phone to serve me as (e.g.
duolingo,3,5,product search history from shopping apes).
duolingo,3,5,that is super creep.
duolingo,3,5,"additional, the pp frequently rests during a lesson and you lose all your work and have to start the lesson over."
duolingo,3,0,could be better.
duolingo,3,0,i am learning dutch and there is no explanation of any of the grammar or why certain words are used instead of others.
duolingo,3,0,the dutch does not have as much structures content as french or german.
duolingo,3,0,i love using the pp but need to keep referring to other material to explain the language better.
duolingo,3,0,"trying to learn chinese, and it started out ok. but i have experienced a bug with missing sound/sound stops working, more and more which don't get fixed by starting the pp."
duolingo,3,0,that combined with the match of sound and chinese sign where the sounds not always match the word (not correct tone) makes me look for another alternative to domingo.
duolingo,3,0,i truly like this pp.. but i dont know but has happened that i can listen to the andros!
duolingo,3,0,which makes it awful!
duolingo,3,0,i wish u guns could fix it!
duolingo,3,0,"i have a problem with this pp, recently i have audit problems in pp it doesn work for many lessons."
duolingo,3,0,"also after the latest update there are new problems, solve them please"
duolingo,3,10,the updated version is good.
duolingo,3,10,especially with the stories.
duolingo,3,10,"the only problem send to be the fact that whenever i go from one section (the levels, suppose) to another section (the ranks list), everything appears rested back to first position."
duolingo,3,10,"the league medals, the ranks, the levels, the stories."
duolingo,3,10,everything starts from the first instead of where i'm now (or where i last finished).
duolingo,3,10,please look into this problem.
duolingo,3,1,everything was going well then the pp got updated and now i have to pay to skin a level on a subject?
duolingo,3,1,not even 1 lingo but 5?
duolingo,3,1,come on :( this is not fair for reviews please return the free shipping or at least make it cheaper!
duolingo,3,1,i really like domingo but this update makes me so slow in learning.. i know they anna earn but surely losing your old users is not the way
duolingo,3,8,"for japanese, domingo needs work."
duolingo,3,8,"sometimes i get anti i've never seen before, not spelled out."
duolingo,3,8,i only figure it out by elimination.
duolingo,3,8,"after introducing ""refreshing"" courses, i find that most of my limited time i spend on the pp is used retreating the same categories over and over, plateauing my progress."
duolingo,3,8,"lastly, for japanese, social context is important."
duolingo,3,8,"it reaches that ""domo"" is an acceptable way to say thanks, but it's only for informal cases, and would be considered rude if used casually"
duolingo,3,0,"not bad, but i prefer to use a computer."
duolingo,3,0,mainly because i cannot see my assignment to gage how much i have left to do for my weekly german homework.
duolingo,3,0,i hope they implement an assignment tax soon.
duolingo,3,16,it gets three stars because the webster is far more interesting i would love to have the 'stories' and 'forms' and everything that is online on the pp.
duolingo,3,16,the pp has potential for growth and i love that more languages are being added.
duolingo,3,16,but adding more features from the site would be helpful for those who have no computer or can't get on the computer all the time to access the other features.
duolingo,3,16,"i also believe a lot of levels should bundle things together such as alphabet,numbers and so on."
duolingo,3,8,domingo can be a nice introduction to a language.
duolingo,3,8,it can help encourage you out of your fear of language learning.
duolingo,3,8,it'll get you used to some words and phrases.
duolingo,3,8,it does not show you how to use phrases in conversation.
duolingo,3,8,there is no immersion in the language for more than one or two sentences there is always english around it.
duolingo,3,8,"hopefully anyone using domingo is treating it as a bridge to a more robust beginner course, rather than the only source of a language."
duolingo,3,0,"it's pretty good, it reaches you the basis but you could never really be client as they claim using this."
duolingo,3,38,i used to love the pp before it got updated - i would have given it 5 stars before.
duolingo,3,38,i do not like that each level only has 5 lessons now as the harder it gets the more lessons you need to understand it.
duolingo,3,38,the heart feature makes it seem like a game and i am trying to learn a new language not using the pp as a game.
duolingo,3,38,i want to carry on learning through mistakes not having to wait 4 hours for a heart to try again.
duolingo,3,38,i hope it gets changed back else i may look for a new pp.
duolingo,3,2,the free version is ver generous and the structure is good too.
duolingo,3,2,"however, recently, the pp has been very buggy."
duolingo,3,2,random the audit cuts off in the middle of building sentence and the listening bits sometimes say nothing.
duolingo,3,2,another complaint i have is that some sentences do not translate accurately and i get the question wrong despite knowing the correct answer.
duolingo,3,17,domingo as a whole is a really well made pp.
duolingo,3,17,"you should use other sources to learn a language bluntly, but this is a great start."
duolingo,3,17,"however it makes no sense to me why it's not linked with the desktop site- if you do a course on desktop site, it won't count toward your streak on the pp- i lost a 300+ day streak."
duolingo,3,17,"also, you can't spend lights on the pp (giving to commanders on the boards), and i'm just accumulation them."
duolingo,3,35,this pp was absolutely amazing when i first started it.
duolingo,3,35,the update where you only need 5 lessons to get to the next level has seriously missed up the whole experience.
duolingo,3,35,"i'm the type of person to need those extra lessons because without them, i won't know when i should move on and i get lost."
duolingo,3,35,"it discouraged me so much, and i haven't touched the pp in weeks."
duolingo,3,35,i'm seriously hoping they change it back.
duolingo,3,35,"the more they update, it just makes it feel like some kind of game to be plowed through."
duolingo,3,8,update (from 5 stars): 2 things happened since the pp update.
duolingo,3,8,"like some mentioned already- this definitely became more of a ""game"" and less of an educational tool."
duolingo,3,8,"they cut the amount of lessons you need to advance to the next level, and you don't learn or retain much."
duolingo,3,8,repetition is important for retention.
duolingo,3,8,"secondly- despite placing th (and you need to place top 10 to advance to the next league), i have been stuck in the same league for days."
duolingo,3,8,"it says i've advanced, but it does not reflect it."
duolingo,3,4,not a huge fan of the leader boards.
duolingo,3,4,i was wondering how people were getting thousands of points until i realized they're working on other languages.
duolingo,3,4,seems a bit unfair.
duolingo,3,4,"also, the lights are a waste."
duolingo,3,4,there is really not much to spend them on.
duolingo,3,4,there should be a penal option where you can find others working on the same language an starts chats with them.
duolingo,3,0,"terrible pp design, can log in cat leave pp."
duolingo,3,0,i had to reinstate the pp to be able to log in... despite that pp worth using
duolingo,3,6,"this pp is quite useful but please, for god's sake, put in an easy option where we can turn speech/audit off when desired."
duolingo,3,6,not having this is a large oversight.
duolingo,3,6,sometimes i want to open the pp and practice for a few minutes in situations where it's not appropriate to have my phone yelling at me out loud in german.
duolingo,3,6,"or i have music playing, and don't really want random words bearing over it."
duolingo,3,6,"also having to tap through 5 or 6 different buttons after a lesson (congress, quit, etc) is annoying."
duolingo,3,0,amazing pp i remember having to do 2 years of french in school and i learnt absolutely nothing.
duolingo,3,0,i've now done a few months of spanish and i've learnt a lot.
duolingo,3,0,but i only gave it 3 stars because the heart system is so annoying and restrict my progress (which is apparently your main priority).
duolingo,3,0,it's so annoying because you accidently press the wrong letter and it takes a life away and you have to either wait like 4 or 5 hours for another life or do a load of practices and as to regain them.
duolingo,3,10,"this is a decent pp for starting to learn a language, but there are some bags."
duolingo,3,10,"the first is, no matter how many times i watch the video my lights never double."
duolingo,3,10,"and, i finished top of the leader board and get a ratification for ""my reward"" and.....nothing."
duolingo,3,10,"so, i'm only donna give 3 stars instead of 5. it's engaging and i am actually learning."
duolingo,3,10,"the lessons are fun, the competition aspect helps a lot, but if i win i should win."
duolingo,3,20,i love this pp.
duolingo,3,20,it's easy to pick up and work on in short bursts.
duolingo,3,20,i wish it didn't drain my battery so fast.
duolingo,3,20,"edit (11/7): i just learned that the grammar tips and whatnot are only available on the web version, save for the few languages the added to in the last update."
duolingo,3,20,i'm using the pp to learn japanese and irish.
duolingo,3,20,i couldn't understand the grammar rules for irish.
duolingo,3,20,thankful someone in the comments posted it.
duolingo,3,20,that's really disappointing.
duolingo,3,20,love the pp because it's easy to use in my busy life.
duolingo,3,0,used domingo for a few years to learn some german originally to impress my (then) s.o.
duolingo,3,0,"over the years i've seen many updated and expansions, and they're still happening."
duolingo,3,0,"id say my overall experience with do is 5 stars, but the pp is a little less because it just feels to easy now.... yes it still helps me practice and use it, but the desktop version is more vigorous in my opinion and therefore more useful."
duolingo,3,2,my review is for the japanese lesson.
duolingo,3,2,i think domingo is a great idea and i'm glad it exists.
duolingo,3,2,"however, i think the japanese section is not as good as it could be for an english speaking native."
duolingo,3,2,there is no instruction whatsoever for how grammar works up to the point where i have reached.
duolingo,3,2,you just memories and repeat what they show you.
duolingo,3,2,this is difficult because japanese is very different than english in grammar.
duolingo,3,2,once i picked up some language learning books things got easier to understand.
duolingo,3,36,an undesirable resource!
duolingo,3,36,this pp is a great way of learning languages and keeps you motivate towards reaching your goals.
duolingo,3,36,"sadly, i've lost interest in using this pp for now, after i was forced into the new ""health"" update."
duolingo,3,36,"i used the pp less and my sessions only became more spare, until finally, i've delete it and wrote this review."
duolingo,3,36,"the system is too harsh (long refresh, too few lives), and the price of premium is too high for a casual user like me."
duolingo,3,36,there must be a middle ground.
duolingo,3,9,last update was a big disappointment.
duolingo,3,9,"you can't speak anymore in the pp to know if you're pronouncing correctly, not that this feature always worked properly."
duolingo,3,9,"but in the harder levels, there are discrepancies where a translation is correct once and not the next time."
duolingo,3,9,"if i'm wrong, i'm ok with that, but give me an explanation or rational so i can learn instead of guessing."
duolingo,3,9,fix these features and i'll go back to five stars.
duolingo,3,19,it is very good overall.
duolingo,3,19,the fact that you have to purchase life when you fail or wait is a massive turn off.
duolingo,3,19,but the pp is great and the lessons are very good.
duolingo,3,19,made me learn a lot in few days to be comfortable to write.
duolingo,3,19,it miles visual with audit learning and you get a lot out of it.
duolingo,3,19,will bump my review to 5 stars if they get rid of the painless life system.
duolingo,3,1,"i like this pp however, i don't know if it was helpful at teaching me basis like numbers and how to conjugal a verb."
duolingo,3,1,"my biggest issue (i'm learning spanish) is often you are asked to type what you hear, i've ran into the problem where the pp says ""un"" but it is supposed to be ""un"" and i get dined for it."
duolingo,3,0,would have been 5 stars before the crowns update.
duolingo,3,0,now it's 3. should still give us ability to repeat lessons at very least
duolingo,3,0,"really effective language learning pp, however i am annoyed by the 'incentive' mechanics."
duolingo,3,0,makes me not want to log on may.
duolingo,3,0,the only thing that bags me for a while is that i cannot access the lecture notes in the pp itself.
duolingo,3,0,i can access them on the webster version of domingo.
duolingo,3,0,it would be very nice to add them on the pp swell.
duolingo,3,0,it makes it very hard to study without them.
duolingo,3,0,dark mode would be much appreciated swell.
duolingo,3,0,white on white makes me blind after a while...
duolingo,3,4,i like this pp to have daily practice with reading and listening at least.
duolingo,3,4,"but often, i don't know why, the pp lose the connection during a lesson."
duolingo,3,4,"so, i have no audit at all."
duolingo,3,4,"after finished the lesson, i have a message to say no network."
duolingo,3,4,i need to close and open the pp to continue.
duolingo,3,4,it's annoying.
duolingo,3,1,"for a free platform, it's not bad."
duolingo,3,1,"but, the phrases used (spanish) to teach the language are weird, and sometimes just unnatural."
duolingo,3,1,"also, don't like the leagues, it makes it more about racking up points instead of learning the language."
duolingo,3,6,"i'm a big fan of do, but (re)introducing the health system in the pp makes me totally disappointed (and the pp unable, mio)."
duolingo,3,6,i was using the pp both on is and andros an i have to say that being punished for my mistakes in the is pp made me uncomfortable all the time.
duolingo,3,6,so i learned using the andros pp but today the hearts appeared in the andros version also.
duolingo,3,6,now i'm really thinking to delete the pp!
duolingo,3,6,could you pus tell me what are your intentions with this health/hearts system?
duolingo,3,10,the pp has a good design and the amount of languages is huge.
duolingo,3,10,i appreciate the effort and i am using it for a while now.
duolingo,3,10,the only thing that holds me back from buying an ad-free version are the boring and redundant exercises.
duolingo,3,10,"even at higher levels of one topic in turkish, i am still, for the millionth time, filling out stuff like ""elephants and cats"" or ""i am eating fish""."
duolingo,3,10,i wish there were new words or sentences in levels from 1 to 5. and i dont want to write out stuff in english.
duolingo,3,3,the free version of this pp now gives you a limit of 5 mistakes.
duolingo,3,3,"after that you either can complete practice rounds to regain ""health"" or buy them with points."
duolingo,3,3,very annoying.
duolingo,3,3,"also, most aspects of the language grammar are not explained."
duolingo,3,3,this pp is easy to use and helps with memorization.
duolingo,3,3,and you can turn off the speaking and listening features.
duolingo,3,4,this pp is perfect to study.
duolingo,3,4,but there are some disadvantages.
duolingo,3,4,e.g.
duolingo,3,4,when i do listening tasks the sound doesn't work.
duolingo,3,4,how can i give the right answer in this situation?
duolingo,3,4,and there are also some troubles in studying russian.
duolingo,3,4,(incorrect emphasis) i'd like to have speaking exercises in japanese.
duolingo,3,4,thanks for opportunity to learn foreign languages.
duolingo,3,4,good luck!
duolingo,3,20,domingo has come a long way and is a very fun to use pp for learning.
duolingo,3,20,"but, there is a constant bug causing the sound files to not load properly, resulting in silent lessons that punish you for not being able to hear the language."
duolingo,3,20,"this makes failure impossible to avoid when you are supposed to translate what you hear, and you can't even hear anything."
duolingo,3,20,this makes you fail lessons and interrupt the otherwise enjoyable learning experience in an annoying way.
duolingo,3,20,a 5 star pp without this issue.
duolingo,3,1,"hello, please do, fix this."
duolingo,3,1,it is not even recording my audit and my star gets detected everytime audit questions come up.
duolingo,3,1,"it is not recording, forget anything else."
duolingo,3,1,i have tried and checked every setting on my phone still not working.
duolingo,3,1,pus help.
duolingo,3,1,my experience have been good but pus help with this!
duolingo,3,0,"so i'm using this pp for quite a while and have domingo plus subscription, there's these progression quires which seems to be most illogical in the whole pp, like they ask questions there which you didn't even learned before, words that you never even heard of before but they still appear there."
duolingo,3,0,"even more, almost all of the questions on these quires are from the stuff that u didn't learn."
duolingo,3,0,it was the only thing why i bought a year subscription plan but it seems so useless now...
duolingo,3,66,this pp has bags that do not allow you to click on the correct response.
duolingo,3,66,it has happened to me more than a dozen times and i've reported it each time.
duolingo,3,66,"for months, these errors have not been fixed."
duolingo,3,66,"because of this, you cannot finish a lesson, or level, and must abort the whole thing."
duolingo,3,66,this happens primarily on the more complex lessons.
duolingo,3,0,most of the pp is just fine.
duolingo,3,0,"the snug, patronizing, unskippable ""here's a tip"" screens make me want to throw my phone out of the window."
duolingo,3,0,i loved this pp when i download it months ago on another device.
duolingo,3,0,now the hearts and tests are limited?
duolingo,3,0,"that's not cool, hope u change that."
duolingo,3,0,but there's also a few things i hope you could add.
duolingo,3,0,1- how to correctly pronounce and write the letters.
duolingo,3,0,(especially symbol languages like chinese) not in a lesson but on the side.
duolingo,3,0,"2- add suggestions for translated books, moves, pick,... etc."
duolingo,3,0,for the learned language.
duolingo,3,0,3- try to make the word's voices less robotic and more like native speakers.
duolingo,3,0,thanks
duolingo,3,1,"for the past few days, my pp has started giving problems."
duolingo,3,1,"despite being connected to the internet, i cannot proceed to the next level as it shows that i've lost connection."
duolingo,3,1,have to recollect everytime.
duolingo,3,1,"in the listening based questions, the audit doesn't work."
duolingo,3,1,pus help.
duolingo,3,1,domingo is awesome other wise.
duolingo,3,5,useful in general for learning a new language.
duolingo,3,5,however you need to be excessively patient.
duolingo,3,5,"i'm learning spanish, an easy to learn language according to pop census, and i will put in the right word or have a minor type and the pp will see it as a total screw up and cost me a heart."
duolingo,3,5,it's extremely frustration and holds you back from learning to your full potential.
duolingo,3,5,this problem also holds you back from ever considering paying for the education if it can't even deliver it properly
duolingo,3,3,"it's helpful for learning vocabulary & it reaches sentences, but it doesn't explain grammar and verbal conjunction well."
duolingo,3,3,with languages like japanese this is important because it's nothing like english.
duolingo,3,3,"anti on'you, & run'you are also ignored."
duolingo,3,3,"even though sentences are written completely in japanese in later lessons, the chance you'll be able to read it in silence is almost nothing."
duolingo,3,3,formality isn't mentioned either.
duolingo,3,30,"this pp is good for the free version, i wouldn't pay for this."
duolingo,3,30,"my account was lost, so i lost all that progress."
duolingo,3,30,"and now there some mechanics so if you get things wrong, you have to wait until your 'hearts' are filled."
duolingo,3,30,also each lesson is different in the quality.
duolingo,3,30,"my girlfriend uses this to learn spanish, which is pretty good for the most part."
duolingo,3,30,"but i am learning organ and the lessons, from this pp, are not that great."
duolingo,3,3,i tried it seems many people love this pp.
duolingo,3,3,maybe it's just me i'd like more basic instruction and less quit.
duolingo,3,3,"and when i've blown a lesson, i'd hope to get medial on that topic, rather than being quitted on basic vocal; after 75 days and over 75 hours i can generally get cat, dog and monkey correct, but i never really get irregular verbs."
duolingo,3,3,"i may try again sometime, by which time it will be from the very beginning, but while i'd love to learn more i can't devote multi hours daily."
duolingo,3,0,its a great language learning pp.
duolingo,3,0,"i would have given it a 5-star rating if it was not for the fact that, the pp developer did not add a section for users who were completely new to a language they were about to learn by taking them through 1. the sounds of the language they are learning."
duolingo,3,0,2. how to blend the sounds to form syllables and words.
duolingo,3,0,3. how to decide words in order to read phrases and sentences.
duolingo,3,2,i enjoy learning languages with this pp but have faced some issues.
duolingo,3,2,i noticed that a lot of french words are being pronounced very wrong by the pp.
duolingo,3,2,i am part french so i know what it's supposed to sound like.
duolingo,3,2,further i am a little disappointed that all the updated that are coming for french aren't coming for norwegian as well.
duolingo,3,2,"i really could use some grammar tips for norwegian from time to time and those new stories that just came for french would be a great addition for norwegian, too."
duolingo,3,2,"some courses are good, like japanese and chinese, while some others are horrible, like organ."
duolingo,3,2,overall it's very hit or miss.
duolingo,3,10,"it's a great concept, and i like the way they've ratified learning, but the pp can be a bit buggy and sometimes just has poor liability."
duolingo,3,10,e.g.
duolingo,3,10,"i've completed one of the 'stories' 3 times but it keeps freezing at the end of it each time so i can't complete it, get the points and move on to the next set."
duolingo,3,10,"also it's maddening that i have to stroll past so many lessons i've done in order to get to the most difficult ones, which are the ones that have most value for me."
duolingo,3,3,"as a language pp, it's the best i've tried."
duolingo,3,3,the way it's set up makes it easy to learn and almost adjective like other games.
duolingo,3,3,my issue is that a lot of the time progress and experience dont get saved correctly.
duolingo,3,3,i've had lessons complete themselves and i've done had to red lessons that didn log my completion.
duolingo,3,3,super frustration.
duolingo,3,1,"it's a good pp for learning different languages and it's enjoyable, but having only a limited amount of heart makes it difficult to learn sometimes."
duolingo,3,1,"also, when learning new words in certain languages, japanese for example, it won't really teach me the word, and then it'll quit me on said word, causing me to lose a heart"
duolingo,3,0,"i had to change my review after looking my streak, because this pp is more than happy to give you modifications for many things except properly execute reminders."
duolingo,3,0,the worst part is that it agrassively promotes it's premium package when you do lose your streak and seems to be on purpose that it conveniently fails to warn or remind you of daily practice.
duolingo,3,0,"honestly i don't care about the points, but the obnoxious premium adds get firing really quick."
duolingo,3,0,aside from that it' 's still a good learning tool
duolingo,3,2,"was great when i started using it several months ago.with every update, they are making it harder for me to learn.when i started, harder levels in a lessons required multiple repeats.the first time i went through them i was hopeless, but by the last time i was lawless.now i only go through it once and have lost all ability to restrain the knowledge."
duolingo,3,2,"when i go back into to review the lessons, it's just the easy questions."
duolingo,3,2,now i am throwing off their learning states by using other apes to learn.
duolingo,3,9,i like using the red lights better because the price of the things made sense.
duolingo,3,9,i also like it better before the update with limited hearts.
duolingo,3,9,we should be able to make mistakes without consequences.
duolingo,3,9,but this pp is pretty good at teaching languages... so...i guess this pp is average for me now.
duolingo,3,9,before the update i was pretty happy with this pp and would have given it 5 stars
duolingo,3,0,it was good when it was completely free but now they have changed it and you need to pay to learn properly.
duolingo,3,29,i believe this pp is an effective and fun way to learn a language!
duolingo,3,29,i am using it to help in my spanish class.
duolingo,3,29,"the gems which you can use to buy things in the store do not cost money, but are earned, and the leagues which your rank in depends on your up is a great idea, in my opinion."
duolingo,3,29,the only con of this pp for me is the listen and type the spanish you hear thing.
duolingo,3,29,"it works well, but it is very much a pain when trying to spell or sometimes hear what is being said."
duolingo,3,29,"but overall, an alright pp."
duolingo,3,0,i've been an aid do user for almost two years and it's been very useful.
duolingo,3,0,i've been learning spanish on the pp with the help of my venezuelan wife.
duolingo,3,0,the problem i've ran into with do is the new heart system.
duolingo,3,0,their new system doesn't allow you to correct mistakes without it costing you hearts and you can lose all your progress on your work.
duolingo,3,0,many of the mistakes are actually mistakes on do's part.
duolingo,3,0,when you were allowed to correct mistakes this was no issue but now i'm looking into other apes.
duolingo,3,1,i really like the pp but how much does domingo plus cost??
duolingo,3,1,i have better chance of finding the holy grain than finding the domingo plus price!
duolingo,3,1,it's such a shame as this pp is great and i would give 5 stars if it weren't for this lack of transparent.
duolingo,3,1,"it feels like this is in contravention of the consumer rights act, i would suggest they change their approach before the ma pick it up"
duolingo,3,18,this is an incredible and well thought language learning pp you can earn currency by doing the lessons and making progress.
duolingo,3,18,you can set your references.
duolingo,3,18,"however, there are issues- inconsistencies when it comes to earning and keeping currency, and no way to report problems."
duolingo,3,18,"for example, i cannot complete word omission exercises because they dont fit the screen."
duolingo,3,18,"when i used the form to report this bug, the bug reporting screen itself doesn't work!"
duolingo,3,18,not great!
duolingo,3,1,yeah it's money gray with it's price subscriptions yeah it's got false promises and yeah they ask for or money before u even start learning a language...but u are learning a language for free.
duolingo,3,1,you will at least remember something.
duolingo,3,0,this is the best pp but for some reason after the updated the sound doesn't work.
duolingo,3,0,please return the sound üôè
duolingo,3,0,"the streak is rather annoying and discouraging....you'll remind us to keep a streak going for a few days and just when you think you've got it, poooffffff your streak is gone because you didn't get the annoying reminder."
duolingo,3,1,me.
duolingo,3,1,what vocabulary is there is not incredibly useful.
duolingo,3,1,it is also quite limited and overlay repetition.
duolingo,3,1,there is little to no actual instruction on grammatical rules so you kind of have to guess and hope for the best.
duolingo,3,1,"i would buy this if i were convinced the lessons contained actual instruction, but i am not convinced they do."
duolingo,3,4,"i am having trouble with letters 3. it has a hiccup and will not acknowledge ""t"" answer even though there are no other option on the watching of letter and symbol."
duolingo,3,4,i can't go any further with the program.
duolingo,3,4,for days it gets to that and stops.
duolingo,3,4,is there a programming problem.
duolingo,3,4,i used domingo for hind before and the problem did not exist.
duolingo,3,4,help!
duolingo,3,2,it's ok. i'm learning organ and what i'm learning is a bit random.
duolingo,3,2,also i'm finding i'm not practicing how to write in organ because it comes up with option in organ rather than me writing it from scratch.
duolingo,3,2,"another thing, i turned 13 yesterday and from what i have read, it is supposed to give you access to the forum and i should be able to add people, but i can't."
duolingo,3,2,thank you
duolingo,3,1,"since the latest update, i'm unable to add new friends, see current greetings progress etc."
duolingo,3,1,when ever clinking on a friends profile (new and old) it returns to the previous screen shortly after.
duolingo,3,1,if friends and competition aren't a large part of language learning for you then the pp is perfect.
duolingo,3,1,if it is then i'd look elsewhere.
duolingo,3,8,it's fairly good for a free pp: lots of motivation and practical learning elements that work for beginners.
duolingo,3,8,"you will come across major stitches every now and then which will inevitably be frustration: sometimes they won't account for lesson points, and other times the pp will say you are wrong even though you type in the right answer, for instance."
duolingo,3,1,i'm learning organ and refreshing my french.
duolingo,3,1,"if i was only doing french i would give the pp 4 or 5 stars, but the organ course is lacking."
duolingo,3,1,in french the lessons build slowly and helpful hints.
duolingo,3,1,"however, organ is not so."
duolingo,3,1,i have to use outside sources to learn about the words.
duolingo,3,1,the lessons don't make sense and there has been zero explanation of honorifics and choosing between different translation option is impossible without outside help.
duolingo,3,1,it's been very frustration.
duolingo,3,3,it's pretty good for a starting point.
duolingo,3,3,there are two major shortcomings though.
duolingo,3,3,the early lessons can sometimes use sentences so simple that it's impossible to drive the intended meaning.
duolingo,3,3,(war lumen has 3 meanings depending on context).
duolingo,3,3,the second and most irritating issue is the quality of the audit.
duolingo,3,3,it's hard to hear exactly what is being said often due to how muddy the audit is.
duolingo,3,3,for example with german i heard (line) very clearly even when using slow talk.
duolingo,3,3,it wanted miner
duolingo,3,2,it's an alright language learning pp.
duolingo,3,2,"but it could benefit from a little more structure, as well as actual alphabet and writing practise."
duolingo,3,2,"in addition to this, there's the program not letting me go back to any previous lesson to do it over."
duolingo,3,2,not being able to visit past lessons is a huge let down and really hamper my learning.
duolingo,3,2,someplace to take and store notes would be great too.
duolingo,3,2,"less of a criticism and more of a want, i would love to see more fantasy languages added."
duolingo,3,2,like token pelvis!
duolingo,3,1,i really like the pp.
duolingo,3,1,it is a great pp for beginners to learn new language.
duolingo,3,1,"however, i try to follow my friend account so we could learn together and motivate each other, the pp didn't let me follow my friend account."
duolingo,3,1,i click the follow button the button change to following but change back to follow again.
duolingo,3,1,i hope the problem can solve as soon as possible thanks.
duolingo,3,7,the lessons are too short they should explain more.
duolingo,3,7,to have explanations you depend of the comments of other users.
duolingo,3,7,to arrive to level 5 on a subject you just keep writing the same sentences over and over.
duolingo,3,7,there aren't too many different kinds of exercises (specially as you progress in the course).
duolingo,3,7,it becomes tedious.
duolingo,3,7,"if you don't anna write there isn't a listening section where you can listen all the vocabulary or sentences you are learning, you have to download the pp of tinicards."
duolingo,3,78,"i am writing this review not to praise all the great qualities of the pp but to complain about something that discourages many users, the heart system."
duolingo,3,78,get rid of it !
duolingo,3,78,it is a disgusting attempt at making earners buy domingo plus.
duolingo,3,78,"it is also ridiculous that this system only applies to some languages and not others, meaning the developer can very easily get rid of it."
duolingo,3,78,"that being said, if it weren't for this, i would recommend the pp."
duolingo,3,0,great pp for learning vocal and working on spelling but not that great for working on pronunciation and sometimes the sentences can be a bit ridiculous
duolingo,3,3,"overall, this is a wonderful pp, however i feel that more languages should be added, such as latin and multiple sign languages."
duolingo,3,3,another thing i'd like to add is that you should be telling people why domingo is free.
duolingo,3,3,it is free because they are basically doing translating work for you.
duolingo,3,3,the people deserve to know that they're doing work in exchange for learning a language.
duolingo,3,3,please update your pp description to let people know why their language education is free!
duolingo,3,4,"i love the brother version of domingo, and i use it all the time."
duolingo,3,4,the pp is just horrible.
duolingo,3,4,this is a learning tool not a game.
duolingo,3,4,there shouldn't be lives!
duolingo,3,4,"it's not even like the lives charge quickly, no, it takes 5 hours!"
duolingo,3,4,"if you loose all your lives, and you don't finish any lessons, that's it, your streak is done for, and you can't practice!"
duolingo,3,4,"so i highly recommend the brother, but don't use the pp."
duolingo,3,135,audit is frequently missing from lessons that are supposed to have audit.
duolingo,3,135,"i really, really don't like leagues."
duolingo,3,135,i don't want to go to private mode just to get rid of them.
duolingo,3,135,they're kind of painless because i already set daily goals.
duolingo,3,135,i'd rather go back to clubs where i can interact with others who are also interested in building skill in a particular language.
duolingo,3,135,"no point in ""competing"" in that respect."
duolingo,3,1,"i like the reminders, the framework of learning languages as a game, and the little do moscow."
duolingo,3,1,i like as well competing with fellow earners and the listening exercises.
duolingo,3,1,"however, i have thousands of gems accumulated that i can't spend because i've already bought the few items that are on offer in the shop."
duolingo,3,1,"i also don't think it is helpful for learning a language so much emphasis on translation exercises, especially translation exercises to the language in which one is already proficient."
duolingo,3,10,i have been using domingo from the past 250 days.
duolingo,3,10,but now i lost interest in it because of it's new feature that allows you to go to the next checkpoint only when you have completed all the 4 levels of each chapter in the previous checkpoint.
duolingo,3,10,this is very annoying because sometimes i dont feel like repeating all the levels of the chapter because i feel i have learnt it enough and it was easier.
duolingo,3,10,everyone has a different capability to grasp.
duolingo,3,10,give flexibility to the user to move ahead!
duolingo,3,10,!
duolingo,3,1,i love the pp and the new language i am learning but i dislike the lives you have with the health system.
duolingo,3,1,it makes me discouraged and as a result i don't want to practice.
duolingo,3,1,i don't find it motivation.
duolingo,3,1,"in my opinion, you need to update this in your pp and implement something else in it's stead for motivation."
duolingo,3,3,"it's good, but also frustration."
duolingo,3,3,its very frustration when you lose health because of a wrong word written in english when i am learning norwegian i don't agree that should lose health being evacuated in english.
duolingo,3,3,plus keeps saying i'm writing in english when i'm not!
duolingo,3,3,"but, great pp, easy to use, and learning very fast... but sometimes very frustration"
duolingo,3,1,good place to start.
duolingo,3,1,lessons are oddly paced but it's good for a totally free option without destructive as.
duolingo,3,1,"where it fails, the community helps."
duolingo,3,1,"the leagues are a good motivation, but sometimes you don't get a reward for placing #1. would love an option to tongue keyboard/word bank use like you can on desktop- tying it out forces me to know exactly what the sentence means."
duolingo,3,1,"however, with word banks, i can get several words wrong and still get the question right, leading to slower learning."
duolingo,3,2,disappointed that it's more like a game than lessons.
duolingo,3,2,hard to keep going if you make mistakes and run out of life and have to wait for more energy.
duolingo,3,2,once i got going wasn't hard to figure out how to gain more live.
duolingo,3,2,"however after a couple of weeks the pp stopped working, not warding health or points.ü§®"
duolingo,3,5,really useful pp.
duolingo,3,5,"however, there are bags that are making this pp pretty much impossible to make progress on."
duolingo,3,5,"it will have you watching words but give you choice that agent correct, and since the watching sections dont cause you to lose any health, the only way around it is to exit the lesson and lose all progress, which also means i can make any progress whatsoever."
duolingo,3,5,give reported this issue several times but nothing change.
duolingo,3,5,the pp was fun while it lasted.
duolingo,3,0,pp works well and lots of option.
duolingo,3,0,one new feature that is more annoying is the breaking of previously completed skill at a rate that at my current learning goal results in only 1 new lesson every 2 days.
duolingo,3,0,"while i appreciate this to ensure retention it seems this should either take into account lesson goals per day, be optional or like lesson goals have a control for decay rate."
duolingo,3,0,this pp would be rate higher by me but this feature greatly diminishes my learning potential based on my time.
duolingo,3,0,i hate the changes the pp keeps making.
duolingo,3,0,"i preferred when each level of a section was the same amount of parts, not broken into 12+ parts by each level as you proceed."
duolingo,3,0,i am already 3 months into doing all of spanish after the 5 level system was introduced.
duolingo,3,0,"also my 5-crown completed sections keep needing to be ""restored"" more frequently than ever even if i am constantly practicing"
duolingo,3,0,this pp is great!
duolingo,3,0,you can learn many languages.
duolingo,3,0,"but there is one thing about the apes title ""learn languages for free."
duolingo,3,0,the life system in the game is the worst and the only way to learn is to pay for for plus.
duolingo,3,0,so there is no free learning.
duolingo,3,0,i know the there are gems but people would save those up for other things.
duolingo,3,0,"love this pp even subscribed to plus but withdrawing the tutor feature really sucks, it was really helping me to learn quicker and understand more about the language, there is really no point subscribing now am really glad i only had a monthly subscription and not an annual one learned!!"
duolingo,3,0,"just what do you get for subscribing, seems to me nothing!"
duolingo,3,3,"this pp has a great selection of languages, however, the recording for the languages are extremely robotic."
duolingo,3,3,organ sounds like a organ microsoft sam.
duolingo,3,3,other apes like lingodeer hire natives to record sentences and it sounds much better.
duolingo,3,3,"also, the learning tips are only for the desktop version which sucks."
duolingo,3,3,this is an pp.
duolingo,3,3,domingo needs to put the learning tips on the pp.
duolingo,3,3,otherwise you will make mistakes and not even know why you were wrong.
duolingo,3,3,"decent pp, needs a lot of work."
duolingo,3,363,not a fan of the new update where if you mess up and lose all your hearts you have to pay gems to replenished them.
duolingo,3,363,with the current system it doesn't allow you to keep missing up until you get it right which is a problem for those just starting out or like to beat thing into their head through repetition.
duolingo,3,363,they also removed the generalized tests.
duolingo,3,363,that is unless you want to go to the pro version but that costs money and the pp tresses the free aspect of it.
duolingo,3,0,"its everything the ad describes it, but domingo then tells you to create a profile so you can continue."
duolingo,3,0,"i did, but the password isn't working and i press forgot password and it told me it sent me something to get me in my account but i can find it."
duolingo,3,0,so i can t continue because of the profile problem üò°üò°üò°üò°
duolingo,3,35,"ok, especially for free."
duolingo,3,35,has a lot of improvement opportunities.
duolingo,3,35,layout doesn't encourage one to find the lesson before the exercises.
duolingo,3,35,right answers can be marked wrong.
duolingo,3,35,some exercises get you spending more time finding *the* official answer than performing a translation.
duolingo,3,35,there's a lack of feedback as to why you got something wrong & why the official answer is correct.
duolingo,3,35,very american rather than english.
duolingo,3,35,plus you're competing in the league against folk who do unreal numbers of exercises each day.
duolingo,3,0,"domingo is ok for learning spanish, though mainland spanish as an option would be preferable to only latin american spanish."
duolingo,3,0,"scoring is frustration, often not registering complete lessons or earning 73 up (points) but the pp only registering 45. making daily goals more difficult, often having to complete additional lessons to meet the goal."
duolingo,3,0,"the new stories are fun, but again often do not allow the final continue to be clicked, so doesn't register."
duolingo,3,0,don't appreciate wasting time!
duolingo,3,0,"so very tired of ""no health left"" penalty that locks the pp when you get answer wrong."
duolingo,3,0,i listen to your as as faithfully to support you but you lock me out constantly.
duolingo,3,0,why??
duolingo,3,0,"you're trying to bribe me to buy ""health points""?????"
duolingo,3,0,for the last 2 days you say i have 399 health points instead of the 450 needed to get stuck because got the last question of the lesson wrong????
duolingo,3,0,really????
duolingo,3,0,this happened 3 times.
duolingo,3,0,whatever.....
duolingo,3,2,"good, fun learning format."
duolingo,3,2,it would be 5 stars if the voice recognition worked.
duolingo,3,2,sometimes it says i am not saying something right when i know i am.
duolingo,3,2,"like ""sin sal""."
duolingo,3,2,then it uses all my hearts and i can practice until the hearts restore in a day.
duolingo,3,2,they need to make it so you dont lose a heart if they can get the voice recognition to work properly.
duolingo,3,1,this was a great pp for learning a new language until they added the heart system.
duolingo,3,1,i am learning japanese and obviously people are donna make mistakes so why make it where they can learn for making mistakes.
duolingo,3,1,sometimes in japanese there are symbols that look similar and learning from english means learning new symbols which means memorizing.
duolingo,3,1,i think the heart system is stupid.
duolingo,3,2,"don't like the new update with ""lives""!!"
duolingo,3,2,i'm stressed now every time i make a mistake that i will be kicked out of a lesson.
duolingo,3,2,"it makes sense when you are trying to test out of a level to have limited mistakes, but not when i'm trying to learn."
duolingo,3,2,"also, when i ran out of lives, it cost 350 to refill."
duolingo,3,2,"when i lost one, i thought if i bought more, it would add 5 more to the 4 i still had."
duolingo,3,2,"but it only filled the hearts, up to 5 max i guess."
duolingo,3,2,so it cost 350 for 5 hearts or 350 for 1 heart.
duolingo,3,2,what gives?
duolingo,3,2,?
duolingo,3,0,"good pp, would like if the courses introduced more important words first like the verbs ""have"" or ""do"" or ""go"" instead of one's for ""eat""."
duolingo,3,0,would have also loved if there was an english to iceland as that's one i'm passionate about and as there are already things like old irish and garlic i thought it might be there too.
duolingo,3,0,leagues are also too much and has more often than not put me off using the pp.
duolingo,3,1,"the pp is great but waiting 5 hours for a heart is way to much, if tat was reduced i would be a lot happier."
duolingo,3,0,"good for beginners, not great for if you are trying to perfect a language you already know."
duolingo,3,2,"i like domingo, but the leaderboards should be optional."
duolingo,3,2,once we've reached a certain league we should keep the badge.
duolingo,3,2,then not have to keep our place because it puts unnecessary stress on people who want to chill out- after having to stay in the leaderboards consistently.
duolingo,3,2,"please also not overcoat the lessons with so many new words, it puts me off learning more because there's too much to take in at once."
duolingo,3,7,works great and is pretty easy.
duolingo,3,7,i can read/understand a bit better but doesn't help much for actual conversation/speaking.
duolingo,3,7,my biggest complaint is that it doesn't have bulgaria!
duolingo,3,7,please add it already!
duolingo,3,7,it's close to russian but not close enough (i used russian and have now stopped).
duolingo,3,7,over 15 million people worldwide speak bulgaria (and people in macedonia basically speak bulgaria too).
duolingo,3,7,please add properly sap and i can bump rating up to five stars i only got this pp for bulgaria.
duolingo,3,1,i'm enjoying the way the pp presents mixed elements of the language - both listening and vocabulary can be trained a little with this.
duolingo,3,1,the progression system gives it a dynamic that makes it hard to completely drop it.
duolingo,3,1,"my main two issues with domingo are the following: it does not teach you grammar or the use of the vocal you learn properly, if at all."
duolingo,3,1,the included text lessons are rudimentary.
duolingo,3,1,"also, there is no way to repeat lessons, which is unacceptable if you wish to revise the material."
duolingo,3,3,learning japanese.
duolingo,3,3,"took away a star because many translations are dependent on hearing a word or phrase and the sound quality is often poor, happy, or just missing."
duolingo,3,3,the other star i took is because i feel like there is a gap that needs filled between letters and numbers/now start translating these full sentences.
duolingo,3,0,"the apes is super good and awesome.. really interesting way to learn language and its super effective.. just recently, the pp keep crashing when i open into description for ""into 1"" in japanese language after the paragraph explaining of ""showing respect"".. its like dont want to show me the whole page of the into.. please fix this as i love thus pp so much.."
duolingo,3,0,"i have only been using the pp for a couple days but i'm enjoying how it repeats lessons in fun and different ways, i don't like the adds on the free version but at this point i will put up with them until i decide otherwise."
duolingo,3,0,"this is the rd pp i've tried and so far, by far the easiest to maneuver."
duolingo,3,0,thanks
duolingo,3,263,in general it's okay but it no longer makes you speak into the pp so not sure if my pronunciation is good.
duolingo,3,263,also very stingy on the amount of hearts per day so you're not getting much time on free mode to learn.
duolingo,3,263,it's obvious of you want to learn properly you need to pay.
duolingo,3,263,that's completely fine but don't advertise it as a free pp to learn.
duolingo,3,263,false advertising.
duolingo,3,5,my experience with this pp was good then took an abrupt turn.
duolingo,3,5,"through unfortunate events, i had my subscription canceled and now it costs me $2 dollars more to subscribe."
duolingo,3,5,all of this occurred within less than two weeks.
duolingo,3,5,"on a limited budget, that means a lot."
duolingo,3,5,thinking about trying other apes.
duolingo,3,0,hello!
duolingo,3,0,i really like the pp and use it really frequently but i only have one issue after the make.
duolingo,3,0,you can no longer see the up under or next to each language which really helped me see which one i should practice first or more.
duolingo,3,0,please please please add the up where you pick your languages.
duolingo,3,0,the pp would have 5/5‚òÜ for me otherwise
duolingo,3,0,"just being asking, after the latest update, am i the only one that cannot find the comment icon (the typical diploe-like one) on the bottom right of each single question's answer bar?"
duolingo,3,0,now i wonder how to bring up questions or view the discussion under a certain sentence.
duolingo,3,0,update: pp freeze when connection is unstable.
duolingo,3,0,prompt to continue a lesson series prevents you from jumping to a different lesson.
duolingo,3,0,everything is great and better than other apes.
duolingo,3,0,but the pp download only the correct answers when you start a lesson.
duolingo,3,0,"when the phone loses internet connection, like frequently on the subways, the pp will not pronounce any answer choice, except the correct one."
duolingo,3,0,"annoying me, now."
duolingo,3,0,"i have been enjoying using this pp, to try to learn german, but now it's getting a bit annoying when i'm getting a question correct, but it keeps saying that i've got it wrong."
duolingo,3,0,"even though in the correct answer window, it's putting what i've type in exactly!!"
duolingo,3,0,"and i've just updated it, as well, so it's not out of date."
duolingo,3,0,"there has been a problem with domingo recently, the listening lessons doesn't work or it suddenly stops working."
duolingo,3,0,how can i fix it?
duolingo,3,0,"great pp, user friendly and easy to learn."
duolingo,3,0,currently learning french but there are a few bags.
duolingo,3,0,- previously the pp would ask me to pronounce the french words but now it doesn.
duolingo,3,0,- some french words don't show the english meaning a few others i can think of at this stage but otherwise would give a better rating
duolingo,3,4,"i've never been a fan of such apes, as i find they don't really help me, however i thought i'd give it a go to kill time when on public transport."
duolingo,3,4,"2 minutes into my first lesson and there is already a bug, because of which my answer is incorrect."
duolingo,3,4,"it's in the section where you have this little turtle button, to listen to the sentence in so-mo."
duolingo,3,4,the bigger button says an incomplete sentence.
duolingo,3,4,"the last word is missing, hence my wrong answer."
duolingo,3,4,i had to tap the turtle to hear the full sentence.
duolingo,3,0,"i found no instructions when i first started had no idea what streaks, etc were."
duolingo,3,0,a tutoring before starting would be helpful.
duolingo,3,0,"it 's good pp , but i can't hear the pronunciation of the words i don' t know why"
duolingo,3,0,good pp.
duolingo,3,0,"i just dont like the whole heart point thing, it really limits the whole learning process."
duolingo,3,0,"so the more incorrect answers you give, the less you can learn."
duolingo,3,0,"you should learn from your mistakes, not be punished for them..."
duolingo,3,0,love the pp.
duolingo,3,0,would like to see a dark mode for when using before bed.
duolingo,3,0,japanese is scale badly and unfairly compared to easier languages.
duolingo,3,0,words should be taught and then come back to anti.
duolingo,3,0,lessons are starting to become way larger than the typical piece meal.
duolingo,3,2,the cracking needs to stop!!!!!!
duolingo,3,2,you complete a level and next week it cracks and you lose what you've completed!
duolingo,3,2,"you have to keep doing old ones that you never get a chance to finish the next level also the achievements don't always register, like the rewards for invite friends or equip speak freeze."
duolingo,3,2,also the timing for new lives or hearts is very buggy as it will go all night and only gave one heart and 5 hours until the next one!!
duolingo,3,2,otherwise very good very good
duolingo,3,0,really great and it is helping me so much when learning languages.
duolingo,3,0,"i only gave three stars as if you have lost all your lives, you have to wait five hours to get just one heart back."
duolingo,3,0,i looked at the premium but the total added up to over ¬£100 a year and i am sorry but i don't have that sort of money just lying around.
duolingo,3,0,"this pp is actually very good to improve your language skill, but there are so many inappropriate as, even though there written ""this ad helps keep us education free""."
duolingo,3,0,i think that's no makes sense.
duolingo,3,0,"please, don't show inappropriate as anymore."
duolingo,3,1,"i love this pp so so much, it's very easy to pick up a language."
duolingo,3,1,"however, i have 2 main concerns."
duolingo,3,1,"one is that you can not delete a course which can be very annoying (i do know you can do it on your lawton but it's too much of a haste) and the second think is the concept of lives, i think it's a good idea but i hate how you only have 4 lives and it takes for ever to replenished them."
duolingo,3,1,"please could you remove the heart system, it would be greatly appreciated."
duolingo,3,0,i really love this pp but i think it's ridiculous that you have to pay for lives.
duolingo,3,0,you can only gain 1 life bar per practice which is frankly a waste of time.
duolingo,3,0,my kid's love this pp but i'm not going to pay for this twice because one has an apple phone.
duolingo,3,0,i mean you want to teach a language to someone but you want to charge an arm and a leg just to do it.
duolingo,3,0,i'm very disappointed .
duolingo,3,0,i really love this pp.
duolingo,3,0,my only problem is that i don't have the option to switch from using the word bank to tying out my answer.
duolingo,3,0,"i'm sure word banks are useful for a lot of people, but writing really helps my retention."
duolingo,3,0,"i don't want to get rid of the word bank, i'd just like the option!"
duolingo,3,1,"game was fun for a bit, you can skin the as easy enough."
duolingo,3,1,the competition for me was my driving force to keep practicing every day.
duolingo,3,1,i didn't enjoy being ranged up against languages that are far easier to learn.
duolingo,3,1,when they bring language specific leagues i'll come back.
duolingo,3,2,i've enjoyed using this pp the past few weeks but i'm finding all the tying to be a real pity.
duolingo,3,2,i seriously doubt i'm going to last.
duolingo,3,2,if you want to spell spanish words and type all the time this would be a 5 star pp.
duolingo,3,2,updated dec 21 the repetition type on my phone is getting older by the minute.
duolingo,3,1,i loved everything about domingo before the latest update added hearts / lives so you can only fail so many times with a new lesson until you have to either take extra time to earn more hearts or of course pay for them.
duolingo,3,1,this update will literally add months if not years to the completion of my chosen language.
duolingo,3,1,despite this update i have learnt tones so it's still worth a download.
duolingo,3,0,this most recent update forces a keyboard language change to the french keyboard when a written response is required.
duolingo,3,0,i am not using this pp to learn to the french keyboard.
duolingo,3,0,fix this.
duolingo,3,0,in the meantime i am going to install my french keyboard.
duolingo,3,0,"***update, i don't even have a french keyboard installed, so this is a serious bug that needs to be corrected."
duolingo,3,0,******
duolingo,3,0,i like using this pp for swedish but i do find it strange how there are 'lives' so if you don't understand something and keep getting it wrong you have to quit your assignment and get rid of the time for improving so that annoy me a lot because i'd rather not pay to make mistakes and not have to fear about getting it wrong.
duolingo,3,0,"ironically, the as read ""this ad helps us keep education free"" but you have to pay for plus to get infinite lives."
duolingo,3,91,a simple use case is missing.
duolingo,3,91,"for example, i want to improve english, and want to keep my pp's language english as well."
duolingo,3,91,not possible in current version.
duolingo,3,91,"if you choose one language to learn, the pp's i must change to a different language, which is not always desirable."
duolingo,3,91,i hope the team will do something about it.
duolingo,3,199,"this new ""hearts"" idea is stupid and limiting."
duolingo,3,199,"it restrict how much learning you can do at once and punishes mistakes, which is an essential part of the learning process."
duolingo,3,199,and domingo knows it since their loading screen tips say so.
duolingo,3,199,"if the hearts plan goes through, this pp will be effectively a paid subscription because being punished so harshly for making mistakes will prompt us to just look up the answers which will destroy the learning process."
duolingo,3,0,i would definitely recommend using this pp as a supplement to proper courses.
duolingo,3,0,it tests your vocabulary but does almost nothing in ways of teacher grammar.
duolingo,3,1,domingo is very good at solidifying knowledge.
duolingo,3,1,it should pay attention to spelling and punctuation as in certain languages those are essential to convey the correct meaning.
duolingo,3,1,it is also motivation to receive awards like points and leagues for consisted practice.
duolingo,3,1,"however, sometimes there is too much pressure to stay on top."
duolingo,3,1,like the ratification when someone took my place in the league or having badges for spending points on not required items.
duolingo,3,0,i wish the mobile pp still allowed you to type out the sentence instead of the only having the option to click the right words.
duolingo,3,0,it would also be great if you could rest progress on the mobile pp.
duolingo,3,0,other than that the pp is great.
duolingo,3,0,"learning a new language isn't as easy as it may look, it takes a lot of hard work, besides, many variable are involved to meet our requirements in learning a language."
duolingo,3,0,"the people who built this software should consult with applied linguistic to improve their pedagogy, because it is scientifically outdated and doesn't fulfill to real world communication purposes."
duolingo,3,0,"however, i would like to thank the team for their effort.good luck"
duolingo,3,0,"i really like this pp, i have used it for about 2 years now."
duolingo,3,0,the only thing that i really can't understand is the heart system.. i find it so frustration and makes me want to just close the pp and do something else.
duolingo,3,0,"please remove it, bring back the freedom of learning and relaxing way to learn"
duolingo,3,0,"i like how this pp gives you new vocabulary to learn daily, but you can't really communicate with others, which is a key to learning a language."
duolingo,3,0,i think a cool feature on the pp (that should be free) is connecting users learning a language to users who already know a language.
duolingo,3,0,"this could be a voluntary process where when people sign up for the pp, they are asked which languages they are client in, then connect them with someone who is learning that language."
duolingo,3,0,very good.
duolingo,3,0,satisfying.
duolingo,3,0,"i really love the short stories in portuguese, all of them are brilliant, funny and refreshing."
duolingo,3,0,3 stars because full version is too expensive.
duolingo,3,0,"but overall, yes, domingo is almost perfect."
duolingo,3,0,definitely worth a try!
duolingo,3,1,makes learning another language fun.
duolingo,3,1,i wish it would explain more.
duolingo,3,1,"there are several ways to say hello, goodby, the, etc in most languages and it doesn't explain when each version of the word is appropriate."
duolingo,3,1,i've gotten a lot wrong because of that and had to end my lesson.
duolingo,3,0,"if i would've rate this pp a few years ago, i would've given it 5 stars."
duolingo,3,0,"now, i spend more time reviewing lessons i've already completed than i do progressing into new ones."
duolingo,3,0,"it'd be great if you could just do a level review or something, to where you're not stuck working on the same lessons over and over again, every day."
duolingo,3,0,the latest update delete my progress.
duolingo,3,0,the streak is intact but the number of crowns doesn't match the progress.
duolingo,3,0,i wish people would check their work before making it public.
duolingo,3,0,when listening via earbuds one of the voices in esperanto is like having someone spit in your ear.
duolingo,3,0,i recently started it and have been enjoying it so far to come back to japanese.
duolingo,3,0,however after the update i now just lose hearts random in the middle of a lesson.
duolingo,3,0,i could be at 5 hearts and it will just drop to 0 random and force me either use my gems or quit the lesson.
duolingo,3,0,this needs to be fixed so i can actually progress the learning.
duolingo,3,0,i bought the bonus part after using the pp and when i purchased it it didn clock the part for me so i just wasted 1000 gems for nothing!
duolingo,3,0,!
duolingo,3,0,it's ok.. i can afford the paid option so its a little annoying when my hearts /lives disappear into thin air which happens regularly daily even  - especially when i've just used all of my gems to buy new ones or done practice sessions to earn them back.
duolingo,3,0,give come on today and only have 3 when i haven even done anything!
duolingo,3,0,"this is a pitch that needs sorting... not everyone can pay out for games, and i dont have an issue with as."
duolingo,3,0,the heart feature is unnecessary.
duolingo,3,0,if you start learning a new language of course you're donna make mistakes.
duolingo,3,0,like how of can i remember hiraganas in the second day.
duolingo,3,0,it's only possible to learn something if you already know something from the language.
duolingo,3,0,and that my friends is actually retarded.
duolingo,3,0,great pp with poor hints and pronunciation.
duolingo,3,0,get this only to support learning another language
duolingo,3,0,"i love that it says learn for free, but you get about 5-10 minutes a day that's free"
duolingo,3,0,great pp!
duolingo,3,0,but the recent update took away the option to practice and for me it's quite difficult to do a new lesson everyday.
duolingo,3,0,i can't keep as much of the lesson memories that way.
duolingo,3,0,other than this i have loved it so far and cannot believe it's free!
duolingo,3,1,"this pp's soul purpose was to teach people how to speak another language, with a few as here and there."
duolingo,3,1,"this whole ""heart"" or ""lives"" thing really takes away from the purpose of the pp."
duolingo,3,1,it's a way to get people to start paying for it even though the initial intent was free learning.
duolingo,3,1,"i am using the pp to refresh myself before i take a foreign language class, but am experiencing limits in what i can learn now."
duolingo,3,1,"aside from this awful lives thing, it has always been a helpful pp."
duolingo,3,0,why isn't audit working?
duolingo,3,0,i can't do any listening activities.
duolingo,3,9,"i like do, but their pp for andros and their webster leave quite a bit to be desired when it comes down to the speaking portions of the lessons; can't usually make heads or tails from what you hear them saying because it sounds like they recorded their speakers speaking under an underpass during rush hour and then applied an echo effect to that."
duolingo,3,0,"great learning pp, but i hate that you lose an entire lesson when you're heart health runs out because of mistakes."
duolingo,3,0,it makes any lesson you get wrong even longer because you have to repeat it and it hurts you from getting points to be in the leader board.
duolingo,3,0,i think it's rude.
duolingo,3,18,its advertised as free yet isn free because you run out of gems to buy hearts.
duolingo,3,18,if you're attempting to learn a new language you're going to make mistakes and lose hearts.
duolingo,3,18,if you run out of hearts and can get more the progress is lost for that lesson and can start the lesson without hearts to get better at the language.
duolingo,3,18,pretty back.
duolingo,3,0,"this pp is good, but there is one very big problem i see, how are you suppose to learn if you just get thrown into the language."
duolingo,3,0,"you need to know what the word means before you go trying to learn it, if they just give you a word and you didn't learn it yet, then how are suppose to know it?"
duolingo,3,0,you should fix that...
duolingo,3,6,it's alright but it fails to properly instruct on how to learn any of the material and relief on very vague dictionary hints that are helpful for some lessons but misleading and worse than useless for others.
duolingo,3,6,the answers i have are more literally correct to the translation of the language but still counted as wrong and this happens very often.
duolingo,3,6,"the owl moscow is annoying when you do well because it's interrupting when i just want to finish the lesson, but also condescending when getting it wrong"
duolingo,3,0,enjoyed it up to now.
duolingo,3,0,but am beginning to get suspicious of non real users.
duolingo,3,0,i was ~400 points clear of with place from reaching diamond with ~20 mind and appear to have failed.
duolingo,3,0,i don't think i could physically attain that number of points even with double pub scoring.
duolingo,3,0,disappointed.
duolingo,3,102,"reducing to three starts, because: - the latest update has missed with my progress!"
duolingo,3,102,"i had 5/15 done for many sections on level 4, but now they are complete; - for a few days domingo appears to drain my phone's battery like hell!"
duolingo,3,102,"it constantly appears in the list of apes that used the battery for the past n minutes, and the battery discharges two times faster than before."
duolingo,3,1,"dropping a star, because the audit frequently stops working in the listening lessons."
duolingo,3,1,"dark mode, please!"
duolingo,3,1,the light... it burns us!
duolingo,3,1,the text needs to be larger so the anti are easier to see.
duolingo,3,1,being able to clearly see new anti and work on memorizing them is important.
duolingo,3,5,i feel like i'm constantly editing my review for this pp.
duolingo,3,5,overall i like using it.
duolingo,3,5,there seem to be quite a few bags.
duolingo,3,5,they are usually fixed within a day or two which is good.
duolingo,3,5,but none had ever responded to my email.
duolingo,3,5,frustration but at least something is since to fix the issue i guess.
duolingo,3,0,experience is good but it doesn have tail which is one of the most widely used languages in india and amongst south indians.
duolingo,3,0,would like to see this soon!
duolingo,3,0,"also, pp doesn't explain clearly how the different stages work and points system"
duolingo,3,0,please!!
duolingo,3,0,improve the organ lessons.
duolingo,3,0,"there is no additional into, only tasks!"
duolingo,3,0,"so it's just words memorization, not learning... nonsense (( (the french lessons are great!)"
duolingo,3,15,this pp used to be excellent but after the update to limited hearts you can lose all your hearts in 30 seconds if you make a couple mistakes and it takes hours to refill.
duolingo,3,15,i used to spend an hour or two on this pp at a time and now i rarely open it.
duolingo,3,15,it's all pay to win now.
duolingo,3,10,"the lessons keep twitching and making multiple of one word when i try to drag it, and it makes me lose hearts for getting a problem wrong that i did correctly."
duolingo,3,10,"also, i can't figure out how to change my password or surname when they never gave me the option to create one in the beginning."
duolingo,3,10,the heart system is terrible because you advertise free learning but spasm me with requests to buy do.
duolingo,3,10,plus every time i fail a lesson.
duolingo,3,10,people already complained about the hearts so change them please.
duolingo,3,0,holy holy even though i turned off email modifications i still get them it's so annoying.
duolingo,3,0,"the leaderboards make me feel bad about learning because it turns it into a ""who can get the most points"" rather than learning something new."
duolingo,3,0,i wish they'd teach you the alphabet and grammar rather than just tossing you into learning words.
duolingo,3,0,would be helpful to have more explanations as to why a sentence is structures a certain way rather than no explanation.
duolingo,3,0,could i get my gems back please?
duolingo,3,0,"i started a test and then it said ""an error occurred"" and i didn't get my 5 gems back... and that's the th time now."
duolingo,3,0,"so can you please fix that pitch so we can keep our gems if we don't do the test, and also can i get my gems back as well please!"
duolingo,3,0,"otherwise, i love the pp!"
duolingo,3,0,pretty good!
duolingo,3,0,"the do bird is a really cut and motivation language learning muddy, i'm learning so quickly with this pp and it's great!"
duolingo,3,0,however recently i've noticed that i can't add friends or look at the leaderboards as i don't have any of those features even though my pp is up to date ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
duolingo,3,1,it's honestly a great pp and these people have started off with the right intention i am a middle schooner trying to learn french and i wanted to learn more french outside of school but unfortunately they have added a heart feature which means if you get a question wrong you lose a heart and if you run out of hearts you can't learn anymore which is missed up i shouldn't be locked out of the free time i have because i missed up absolutely ridiculous please remove this
duolingo,3,2,a bit buggy.
duolingo,3,2,every other time i want to start a lesson it says an error occurred and i should try again later.
duolingo,3,2,that's a but tedious.
duolingo,3,2,also i got domingo plus but the streak repair feature doesn't work.
duolingo,3,2,it keeps popping up with the message that it was repaired but the number is still at just 1 day.
duolingo,3,0,good content.
duolingo,3,0,"but the limited number of mistakes you are allowed before you run out of ""hearts"" is quite annoying."
duolingo,3,0,"it feels like they are pushing to make everyone pay for the plus version, but that is a crazy expensive option."
duolingo,3,0,i loved domingo before.
duolingo,3,0,i hate that they made testing out of levels only for plus members.
duolingo,3,0,they should have been creative and created other benefits instead of taking away from regular members.
duolingo,3,0,i enjoy the pp less because i'm stuck doing levels i should be past.
duolingo,3,0,bring back testing out of levels.
duolingo,3,0,"some language courses are well made, but some are quite a disaster, russian-english, and english-russian, for example."
duolingo,3,0,"i am russian and know english good enough to speak it bluntly, but the evaluation test gave me only the basis, of both of them, and words like 'seldom' in russian-english course are not used as much in life, as they are in the pp, while words like 'rare' or 'rarely' are much, much more common."
duolingo,3,0,while courses like english-german are a cake walk with zero problems.
duolingo,3,69,fun but itchy.
duolingo,3,69,"lost gems when i buy more hearts (does not replenished hearts, only takes gems), not gaining hearts at the given time frame."
duolingo,3,69,i have to close and re open pp between levels or it clashes.
duolingo,3,69,too many push modifications.
duolingo,3,69,no obvious way to contact customer service in free version.
duolingo,3,69,i installed hoping to solve these problems but still lost all my gems.
duolingo,3,0,very good n a way but way too much reparative tying of the same phrase over and over.
duolingo,3,0,i get why but its tooooo much
duolingo,3,0,usually the sound doesn't play and i can't hear the pronunciation
duolingo,3,1,"small points: the spoken pieces in french are still sometimes indistinct, and there is also the occasional spelling mistake in french."
duolingo,3,1,"of more concern is that you do not offer english(up), but only the american version of the language."
duolingo,3,1,why is that?
duolingo,3,1,"you may well have a great many u.s.students, but equally, there must be a huge worldwide call for standard english."
duolingo,3,1,it is a significant failure to have the english language presented to your foreign language students by the american version alone.
duolingo,3,0,latest update has utterly ruined the experience.
duolingo,3,0,"so now if i make more than 5 mistakes, i'm out of hearts and get kicked out of the lesson."
duolingo,3,0,"the random practice icon has been removed, so i have to pick a topic to practise."
duolingo,3,0,"then go back to the original lesson, which i have now forgotten."
duolingo,3,0,vicious circle.
duolingo,3,6,"inconsistent with what it seems a mistake, give had things 'wrong' because i left out a question mark when most of the time not putting a question mark is ok. it is in american english so have to get around mistakes such as writing toilet instead of restroom when for us its toilet."
duolingo,3,6,if i could add a screen shot i would show you guns a mistake which is literally because i wrote ' l acres mid' instead of ' lapresmidi' they are both technically wrong but one was accepted over the other.
duolingo,3,6,annoying.
duolingo,3,0,"pp has lives, and an increasing time on said lives."
duolingo,3,0,"it is an effective learning platform, but it definitely isn free if your actually trying to learn."
duolingo,3,0,you lose lives for mistakes and you only get 5. make 5 mistakes and your stuck waiting.
duolingo,3,0,"the first few lives replenished quick, while later on they start to make multiple hours, 3 or more."
duolingo,3,0,this wouldn be an issue but it keeps you from doing lessons and if you run out of lives and are not willing to upgrade to pro you lose progress in lessons.
duolingo,3,0,i love that i can use my free time to learn a new language.
duolingo,3,0,"however after the first couple of lessons, i'm having issues with the keyboard."
duolingo,3,0,"whenever it asks me to write in russian, i can change my keyboard to type the russian characters so of course i fail the course and can progress further."
duolingo,3,0,there have been so many changes and they are not all good.
duolingo,3,0,the reviews prove this.
duolingo,3,0,are the developer even listening?
duolingo,3,0,"anyhow, i have to take my tablet out of the keyboard case in order to type."
duolingo,3,0,the pp will not work in landscape mode on a tablet.
duolingo,3,0,can this be fixed?
duolingo,3,0,it works if i go online.
duolingo,3,0,"this pp continually tells me my answer is incorrect when it matches exactly with what the ""correct"" answer is."
duolingo,3,0,"when i went to the site, i saw hundreds of the same complaints."
duolingo,3,0,hundreds.
duolingo,3,0,frustration!
duolingo,3,5,"i keep tying in the correct answer, it marks it as incorrect and then tells me the correct answer is exactly what i type."
duolingo,3,5,i can't progress because it is stuck.
duolingo,3,5,"it also has me stuck on another level because it incorrectly says that ""thank you"" in italian is ""per favor"" so i get it wrong each time."
duolingo,3,5,i've flagged all these issues within the pp but no feedback from domingo people.
duolingo,3,5,i'm concealing my pro subscription.
duolingo,3,0,"really cool pp, has helped me a lot to improve my spanish."
duolingo,3,0,"unfortunately i can't achieve the 'big slender', no matter how much lights i spend it is stuck on 160/200."
duolingo,3,0,"also, modifications for practice reminders on my smartphone don't work."
duolingo,3,0,"overall i like the format, especially that it gets into verbs right away."
duolingo,3,0,"but -- even though i have the microphone permission on, the pp won't let me do the recorded spoken exercises."
duolingo,3,0,"if that part worked, i'd give it 5 stars."
duolingo,3,0,i can't listen to the pronunciation and even when i tap the speaker bottom to listen to them it won't play any sound .
duolingo,3,0,it used to work so well ink what happened.
duolingo,3,0,can someone help me please?
duolingo,3,0,i love domingo... when it's on my computer.
duolingo,3,0,"using the pp for anything other than practicing what i learned on the webster is a lost cause, especially after they flat-out removed the grammar tips that they already had on the mobile pp!"
duolingo,3,0,it's actually mental that they got rid of this!
duolingo,3,0,"thanks for the pp domingo, but when i'm on mobile, it's nothing but tinycards for me."
duolingo,3,0,p.s.
duolingo,3,0,why are there so many bags all of a sudden?
duolingo,3,0,!
duolingo,3,0,"pretty good basis - repeat things to get words engrained-would like to learn travel phrases first - things i would use to get on a plane, at the train station, getting a hotel, ordering food, being polite - good day, this is my passport, i'd like chicken and rice, etc"
duolingo,3,0,its system of hearts discourages making mistakes when in reality everyone makes mistakes.
duolingo,3,0,"it is a good incentive to learn but at the same time, you often run out of hearts and can't resume learning a language."
duolingo,3,0,"if they just took out the hearts or gave us more every day, this pp would have 5 stars."
duolingo,3,0,domingo is great for learning a language.
duolingo,3,0,it's free and you learn so much in a little time.
duolingo,3,0,"my only problems are that the updated are only available to me a couple months after they are released, and i after i update it doesn't update my domingo."
duolingo,3,1,definitely not happy with the new league system.
duolingo,3,1,"on one level the top 10 got to advance to the next level, i was #5 and i never advanced."
duolingo,3,1,"the rest is ok, i just don't like having a reward system that doesn't really work properly."
duolingo,3,0,"instead of having multiple choice, i think that users will be able to learn better if they had to type things out."
duolingo,3,0,"for example, write the english translation of the given organ sentence."
duolingo,3,0,"if they get it wrong, then they are allowed to tap on the words to check the answer."
duolingo,3,0,the pp has a fun and playful format to learn new languages.
duolingo,3,0,i am banking it 3 stars because i pay for domingo plus but i am still seeing as and i can't download courses office.
duolingo,3,0,if someone from the domingo team is reading this please assist me in recitifying these issues.
duolingo,3,1,"with the most recent update, the pp is not reading out the words unless it's the slow speed/turtle option."
duolingo,3,1,usually sentences and words in the language i'm learning (french) will be read out to train listening and understanding the language too :(.
duolingo,3,1,i'm on andros
duolingo,3,0,they constantly pause the pp and ask for subscription.
duolingo,3,0,disruption.
duolingo,3,0,it's easy to learn but it takes forever to use.
duolingo,3,0,"i just finished ""basis 1"" and that took months with learning everyday and i am not anywhere close to finishing it and you learn extremely slow and the questions are too easy and you learn nothing"
duolingo,3,1,an interesting way to learn a language.
duolingo,3,1,mostly my experience learning spanish has been positive.
duolingo,3,1,"however, there are some frustration things about this pp."
duolingo,3,1,verb conjunction isn't explained.
duolingo,3,1,they just throw conjugated verbs at you and expect you to pick up the patterns.
duolingo,3,1,"the pp adds confusion by teaching glances like act vs qui (both mean here), which isn't necessary or efficient for someone who is just starting with the language."
duolingo,3,1,in general there are no explanations just repetition.
duolingo,3,0,"i would give it 5 stars if max hearts were, say, 10 instead of 5. having to go back and do 5 lessons of practice for every 5 mistakes sounds growth and makes learning new topics distressful and excessively time consuming."
duolingo,3,0,everything else works great.
duolingo,3,5,would have given it a five if you wouldn have added the health aspect into it i think that is a huge drawback to this pp i understand the benefits of the concept but you are already practicing as you go so why limit how much you can learn in a day by having to have health it makes no sense just makes it harder to go forward
duolingo,3,0,"overall if you want to learn a language domingo is a good option it is fun except for german sometimes the masculine and feminine ""are"" get switched around causing me to lose hearts i just bought and stopping me from continuing my lesson this is very annoying and gets frustration and i dont doubt that that doesn happen with other languages if this is only me someone please help"
duolingo,3,6,"it's a nice pp but, having a certain amount of failures defeats the purpose of trying to learn."
duolingo,3,6,if they changed it to have a certain amount of failures for a certain topic and have it kick you out and have you start the topic would be a better implementation.
duolingo,3,0,"it has been good so far, i wish i could use more of it for free since it has as"
duolingo,3,0,"it is very useful,but there is a lot of bags, i can't get in to the lesson, its got frozen and i need to close and open the pp again,and also for couple month there is no sound on the letters exercise"
duolingo,3,0,i can't login into my account through goose come.
duolingo,3,0,i've tried from both my lawton and my phone.
duolingo,3,0,when i push the goose button to login in nothing happens.
duolingo,3,0,but if i push to connect through facebook a window pips open.
duolingo,3,0,(i don't use facebook) what do i need to do?
duolingo,3,0,i recently changed to andros and the pp is not as good as the is pp.
duolingo,3,0,i use it much less since.
duolingo,3,0,it does not work properly for some languages such as turkish.
duolingo,3,0,i checked the microphone settings and it is enabled for domingo.
duolingo,3,0,"still, the speaking exercises do not work properly."
duolingo,3,0,i'm using the pp to increase my english vocabulary but it others me that it has exercises that make me translate from english to spanish.
duolingo,3,0,i think it should just ask me to translate from spanish to english.
duolingo,3,0,its a greeting learning tool .
duolingo,3,0,my only problem is if you hit a wrong word by accident you can correct it
duolingo,3,0,it's a great pp but hate waiting for hearts .. sometimes i only have a couple of minutes to practice other times i would love to do it for hours but i run out of hearts and have to wait .. i just want to learn not wait for hearts .. i'm looking for another pp
duolingo,3,0,i believe the idea of health in the situation of learning is flowed because learning from the start does not guarantee getting everything right.
duolingo,3,0,"if you make just a couple of mistakes, you have to wait to learn again, which seems like a bad system in a learning pp."
duolingo,3,0,wanted to skin to the advance levels but it seems to make you take tests at every level even when paying the subscription.
duolingo,3,0,so it's taking a while to get to the advanced levels when i don't need all the simple stuff :/
duolingo,3,0,it's an ok pp.
duolingo,3,0,but it doesn't teach you dialect and has some political undertones tucked away.
duolingo,3,0,controversial views that whole nations split apart over.
duolingo,3,0,the politics weren't needed here.
duolingo,3,0,seems like an induction attempt.
duolingo,3,0,but maybe its just me.
duolingo,3,0,the sound doesn't work.
duolingo,3,0,i need to hear the pronunciation but it keeps breaking and the sound doesn't play.
duolingo,3,0,please fix it.
duolingo,3,0,otherwise that's a great application
duolingo,3,0,i like this pp it is fun but i am trying to get better at a language and i have noticed that some of the words are incorrect
duolingo,3,0,i find the explanations for usage if parts of speech helpful.
duolingo,3,0,good pp!
duolingo,3,0,"plus could be better, it is just the same thing"
duolingo,3,0,an excellent complimentary way to learn a foreign language efficiently.
duolingo,3,0,"sadly i have to drop 2 stars, one for not attempting to include first(persist) regardless of thousands of written demands over the years, which makes the pp useless in at least two countries (ran & afghanistan), not to mention millions of first speaker immigrants living around the world."
duolingo,3,0,"the other star is dropped to encourage you to try developing your own its, or using a hand from a third party like forgo."
duolingo,3,0,best wishes!
duolingo,3,0,why did you have to introduce the league tables?
duolingo,3,0,"specifically, when you can't progress from the top one?"
duolingo,3,0,do you have to to get those annoying reminders to finish your league even when finishing th from the diamond league.
duolingo,3,0,"scrap the leagues, please."
duolingo,3,0,"domingo plus offers progress quires, but the content is dominated by vocabulary and grammar that hasn't been introduced."
duolingo,3,0,"also, there is not enough emphasis on spelling and speaking new words and phrases."
duolingo,3,0,"i prefer the old version of this all,repeating is the best way to remember,but now,only four or five times a course, u can't remember as well as before."
duolingo,3,0,"so please update it soon, this version is so suck."
duolingo,3,0,it's good for the method of teaching but it lacks in explaining masculine/feminine and why a word is pluralized or singular.
duolingo,3,0,for example the word in the sentence is singular but the french word is plural.
duolingo,3,0,how would i even know the differences if it isn't pointed out?
duolingo,3,0,"if those important things are explained, i would give 5 stars"
duolingo,3,0,i never write a review before but this thing needs to be addressed.
duolingo,3,0,the audit in listening section is sometimes gone.
duolingo,3,0,"if i can't hear a thing, how can i know what the pp says?"
duolingo,3,0,it really missed up my comb strike.
duolingo,3,0,fix it please
duolingo,3,0,"it used to be very good but unfortunately after some unknown update it lost its sound, my owl became speechless"
duolingo,3,0,overall it's nice and easy to use.
duolingo,3,0,"but it has too many mistakes and the portuguese it's not even portuguese, it's brazilian portuguese, there's a difference and it's bad to show the wrong flag as well!"
duolingo,3,0,"i like learning spanish with domingo, but what gets under my skin a little is the fact that as a female speaker, i can't somehow tell the pp i'm female and then describe myself using the feminine -a sound at the end of an adjective."
duolingo,3,0,"i have to use the masculine -o, then basically code switch in my head."
duolingo,3,0,"this is an extra, exist, impediment to learning spanish and it should not take much to correct it."
duolingo,3,0,"it is fairly simple to use, but with all my mistakes, hard to keep my hearts filled."
duolingo,3,0,its was pretty neat with all the languages you can learn and the way it reaches you however they didn provide how to learn tagalog with was kind disappointing
duolingo,3,0,"amazing, if you want to learn any language, come to this pp."
duolingo,3,0,it is so helpful and fun to play.
duolingo,3,0,please however refill my lives quicker.
duolingo,3,0,right now i have to wait four hours.
duolingo,3,0,i can not hear the voices recently .
duolingo,3,0,what is the problem.
duolingo,3,0,my pp is up to date!
duolingo,3,0,please help me in new version the lessons don't often open for meüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
duolingo,3,0,its a good pp but there's a problem that if the person only talks arabic and he wants to learn second language like turkish he can't because the pp change the mane language to english you should solve this problem other than that i would've gave 5 stars
duolingo,3,0,it's a nice pp but it has a pitch.
duolingo,3,0,i was robbed of gems and getting promoted to the next leaderboard.
duolingo,3,0,placed third leaderboard league and never advanced or got any gems.
duolingo,3,0,what's up with that?
duolingo,3,0,"fun, adjective and user friendly!"
duolingo,3,0,"but recently, audit exercises don't play at all and it's getting annoying."
duolingo,3,0,"i have to choose ""can't listen now"" to approach next level."
duolingo,3,0,my experience was great but the only thing was the lives.
duolingo,3,0,they hold you back from playing because if you dont know and you get it wrong you lose a life and if you lose all of them you have to wait hours before playing again.
duolingo,3,0,"it was good but after dating ,i dont have andros.why?"
duolingo,3,1,i feel that this pp will teach you a new language fast.
duolingo,3,1,"however, i think it would be better if they took away the hearts, because it's hard to learn a language when you only got a few hearts left or you can't do anything for the rest of the day."
duolingo,3,1,i feel that it isn't a good way to teach and everyone should know it's okay to make mistakes because it's part of learning.
duolingo,3,0,the pp is great.
duolingo,3,0,"but when i wanted to invite a friend, it doesn't let me follow them."
duolingo,3,0,the problem is with my pp.
duolingo,3,0,i did reinstate it and try again but it didn't work.
duolingo,3,0,it's frustration!
duolingo,3,0,please fix this!
duolingo,3,0,frustration to put the correct answer in and have it rejected by the pp.
duolingo,3,0,unable to complete lessons and refreshed because if this pitch.
duolingo,3,0,andros user.
duolingo,3,0,when its working correctly i enjoy learning and use it daily.
duolingo,3,1,the streak freeze doesn't work anymore.
duolingo,3,1,it's really annoying that one of the only things you can buy with the lights is something that promises to maintain your streak and then you still have to pay 12 dollars to fix it anyway.
duolingo,3,0,if i can't talk to my friends then why a section for friends is there?
duolingo,3,0,it's so boring learning alone.
duolingo,3,0,i want to use those new words in the chat.
duolingo,3,0,till last update it was very good but new league system.... i'll have to install the pp!
duolingo,3,53,"all of a sudden the pp is lagging, the health is not refilling accordingly and it gets all used up even if you answer correctly."
duolingo,3,53,the option to gain health through practice disappeared and the only option to get health is to use gems or subscribe to domingo plus.
duolingo,3,53,but after i subscribe to domingo plus and even after clearing so many levels when i have up boost my banking was stuck on with under emerald league.
duolingo,3,0,"fun to use, i'm using this pp to work on my ability to read and write in spanish."
duolingo,3,0,"i do have a few problem, with some of the exercises though.. since my native spanish is sometimes different from the spanish the pp uses."
duolingo,3,0,"so, what's with this stuff of you have no health whatever left?"
duolingo,3,0,and then we have to buy.
duolingo,3,0,why say it's a free learning pp?
duolingo,3,0,download it yesterday but i may delete it before the week ends.
duolingo,3,0,i was enjoying it until the health stuff started.
duolingo,3,0,make up your minds if you want us to learn or not üíÖ
duolingo,3,0,"the pp version doesn't include the ""lightbulb"" which gives an overview of the coming lesson in: new grammatical rules, concepts, etc... i just learned this now and am a bit frustrated having missed out on all of the prior ones."
duolingo,3,0,why would you leave that out of the pp?
duolingo,3,0,!
duolingo,3,0,"i love this pp but i hate the hearts that go down when you get a question wrong, so when i try to learn my language for the rest of the day i can't, beyond annoying.. other then that the pp is great"
duolingo,3,1,huge downgrade over the years.
duolingo,3,1,"now this pp is riddle with painless modifications and as, gamificafion knob cracked to 11. i get you want to make money but this is still mostly volunteer work."
duolingo,3,1,would be an amazing pp but it takes too long to restore hearts so i'm getting nowhere.
duolingo,3,1,it says free trial but i click it and it wants me to pay for the year!
duolingo,3,1,gutted as my brother learnt arabic with it before the heart system was introduced.
duolingo,3,0,no as - overall the pp isn bad but very disappointed there is no as.
duolingo,3,0,my biggest grip with this pp is the voice portion when learning vietnamese.
duolingo,3,0,"the pronunciation are too quick, and you don't get a chance to hear it well enough."
duolingo,3,0,a great pp although after i transferred to my new phone none of the data transferred over.
duolingo,3,0,at least i didn't throw my old phone away but still kind sucks i can't use my new phone for this pp with out starting my progress.
duolingo,3,0,"great language learning pp, only gets 3 stars because there's no option to differentiate between british and us english."
duolingo,3,0,there are enough spelling and conceptual differences between the languages to warrant both option.
duolingo,3,0,"the pp itself is great, it helps you a lot, but i've spent much more than 50 lights and already equipped a weekend amulet and in the goals it appears like if i haven't done that."
duolingo,3,0,"this would be 5 stars but there is a consistent issue where experience points ate not being applied when unlocking levels, the double experience point feature in the shop does not work some of the time as well."
duolingo,3,0,the old version was better.
duolingo,3,0,"i think you should remove the latest updated when it comes to wait for 3 or 4 hours just to get an heart so you can practice, but anyway it is a good pp and helpful one"
duolingo,3,0,a good way to start learning a new language.
duolingo,3,0,"my main criticism is that the order in which vocabulary is introduced is not very helpful for using ""live"" in simple conversations."
duolingo,3,0,it is really good for a fundamental learning tool.
duolingo,3,0,it has been nice to see the changes of development since domingo started and look forward to additional improvements in the future.
duolingo,3,0,"fun, easy to use and understand, just wish you got more hearts in free mode."
duolingo,3,0,also needs a little more explanation on rules of the language you're learning.
duolingo,3,0,i love this pp.
duolingo,3,0,i find myself remembering what it reaches me and it is a fun way to learn.
duolingo,3,0,"on the downside, the new ""health"" mechanics is without a doubt the most idiotic thing i have ever seen."
duolingo,3,0,it's an easy pp to use.
duolingo,3,0,but the heart part of it is annoying.
duolingo,3,0,"after every lesson it shoves an add in your face and after that it asks you to buy domingo, premium?"
duolingo,3,0,pretty good.
duolingo,3,0,there's a definite focus on vocabulary.
duolingo,3,0,sound random cuts out during lessons.
duolingo,3,0,if it keeps up i'll probably switch to something else.
duolingo,3,0,"very slow going... great idea, but too many repetition."
duolingo,3,0,"very useful for in-between moments, but difficult to use to build vocabulary."
duolingo,3,0,i give it 3 stars because i want clubs back.
duolingo,3,0,"clubs engaged me with my friends, and now there's not an incentive to even log on."
duolingo,3,0,"otherwise its a great pp, it has accurate and good quality lessons"
duolingo,3,0,domingo is useful for supplemented work if you are learning a language in school but not to learn how to converse effectively on its own.
duolingo,3,0,the tips to help understand grammar rules is okay for reviewing concepts you already learned only.
duolingo,3,0,"hi, when i upgrade to new version of this application (domingo), i lost the all of pronunciation sounds :( my phone is huawei put like and it has the last version of andros."
duolingo,3,0,"pp is good, but be aware that the paid version is a 60$ a year subscription, -not- a pay 10$ once to clock the no as version."
duolingo,3,0,double check what you are paying for or get unpleasant surprise charges!
duolingo,3,2,literally tells you to match sounds to words it never showed u before.
duolingo,3,2,is.
duolingo,3,2,some words don't link to the sound and tells u something is wrong next second asks you the same thing and previous wrong answer is now correct... what.
duolingo,3,0,i paid for the service.
duolingo,3,0,the short blocks of training make it much easier to fit into a busy schedule.
duolingo,3,0,it helps to learn basis in organ.
duolingo,3,0,i have not gotten much farther than that.
duolingo,3,0,it's so good!
duolingo,3,0,but the health thing is annoying.
duolingo,3,0,and the as taking up to 30 seconds to finish is also annoying.
duolingo,3,0,"so, 3 stars"
duolingo,3,0,it's not a bad language learning pp.
duolingo,3,0,however i find that it relief too much on phrase learning and should not be a replacement for actual education in the language.
duolingo,3,1,"pp is fairly good, but am not a fan of the limited audit lessons, some of the languages i'm trying to learn have completely different alphabet to english, and having no audit cubs makes them extremely difficult for me."
duolingo,3,0,the pronunciation those not work.
duolingo,3,0,if it had picture it was better!
duolingo,3,0,"sometimes it's a bit literal and the english translations are not completely idiotic, but it's good to keep regular practice and over time things soak in."
duolingo,3,0,good for that.
duolingo,3,1,i like this pp but i have been trying to subscribe to plus for an hour and there is no easy way to do it!
duolingo,3,1,does anybody know how to subscribe to do lingo plus?
duolingo,3,1,!
duolingo,3,0,awesome way to learn languages.
duolingo,3,0,in the current version i can't follow any new friends.
duolingo,3,0,i tap on the blue follow button and it turns grey and then back to blue without working.
duolingo,3,0,i love this pp but i really wish it didn't take 25 hours for all your heart's to regenerate..... and premium is very expensive but if your looking to spend some money then this is good for you.
duolingo,3,0,√≥‚ï≠‚ïÆ√≤
duolingo,3,0,"the pp would get 6 stars if not for their new ""leagues."""
duolingo,3,0,"for those of us actually interested in learning, competing with people that are earning thousands of points a day is counterproductive."
duolingo,3,0,"besides, what person with a full - time job has time for more than a few lessons a day?"
duolingo,3,0,"great pp, i dont like the pay to clock full version, it is not stated in the play store description that you do not get the full content"
duolingo,3,0,i enjoy this pp.
duolingo,3,0,its very easy to learn a language and gives you incentive to keep on learning.
duolingo,3,0,"so far i have learned french, italian and portuguese."
duolingo,3,0,well done!
duolingo,3,0,domingo is acting up right now.
duolingo,3,0,"i will start a lesson and then half way through the voice notes won't work ,what's up with that."
duolingo,3,0,please fix this problem.
duolingo,3,0,i really like this pp and try to use it daily to improve my french.
duolingo,3,0,if it had creation as a course i would easily give it 5 stars.
duolingo,3,0,i wasn't taught as a child and would love to be able to speak to my grandmother and other family.
duolingo,3,0,this is a great way to introduce yourself to the basis of many languages without having to commit to more full-time study.
duolingo,3,0,the as are getting a bit more annoying every week though.
duolingo,3,0,as after every exercise?
duolingo,3,0,insane!
duolingo,3,0,"nevertheless, it's a good pp to learn with speaking, listening and translation exercises to learn effectively and proceed further."
duolingo,3,0,domingo is pretty great.
duolingo,3,0,"it's very easy to use and it tests all aspects of language use (writing, listening, speaking...) and there are so many languages to chose from, for free!"
duolingo,3,0,"this pp is honestly great, but, i wish there were more languages, for example, malay."
duolingo,3,0,"economic, clean and well designed with fantastic teaching libraries."
duolingo,3,0,shame that the free version limits ability to skin through fundamental basis and paid is so expensive.
duolingo,3,0,it is a good application to learn a new language but it takes a lot to pass the level.. multiple questions for the same area and i just wish it give hints about the basic rules
duolingo,3,0,"nice pp anything free is going to be selling , unfortunately every time i get 1 wrong i am locked out for hours as i have no "" hearts "" i cannot afford to buy hearts but would like more of a chance to evolve"
duolingo,3,0,"great way to learn languages i like the idea of losing life as it makes it more of a challenge but feel that it should return quicker or have more life to make it a bit easier,all round good pp though"
duolingo,3,0,it is a good pp.
duolingo,3,0,but it does not have my language.
duolingo,3,0,please work on my language which is rude.
duolingo,3,0,it will be so good if it also included rude to english language courses.
duolingo,3,0,i really like the domingo method.
duolingo,3,0,unfortunately the pp stopped working and i had to reinstate it.
duolingo,3,0,this erased all my progress and i had to take the placement test again.
duolingo,3,0,"weird, i'm doing real well in the pp, but not learning actual unable language skill, just how to say random words....cool i know how to say ""windy"" now , but not basic numbers ...."
duolingo,3,0,terrible voice recognition for learning german.
duolingo,3,0,i work with germans who said my pronunciation was perfect but domingo won't accept it even when in a quiet room.
duolingo,3,0,please fix this.
duolingo,3,0,some times it doesn't play sounds so i can't learn how to pronounce new words!!
duolingo,3,0,i think it has a problem
duolingo,3,0,i'm new with the pp.
duolingo,3,0,"but so far, it's amazing."
duolingo,3,0,i'm learning new words day in day out.. wish some features can work fine without the internet.
duolingo,3,2,"domingo was a really good language learning pp, until the added the hearts."
duolingo,3,2,"i hate them and it makes it hard to learn a new language, especially since i'm learning russian and i've never even tried to learn a new language."
duolingo,3,2,since i make more than 3 mistakes i end up having to wait 5 hours to start my lessons.
duolingo,3,2,"all in all, it's a great pp, but it sucks that they had to add a happy thing like the hearts just to push there ""domingo+"" thing"
duolingo,3,0,sorry guns l love your pp so much and love used it before but when l switched to danish ..... well nun of the andros played that really made me sad .
duolingo,3,0,so l give you lower mark because learning language is impossible without knowing write pronunciation.
duolingo,3,1,great pp but!
duolingo,3,1,"phrases need to be real world use and not ""i'm a boy""."
duolingo,3,1,also think the pp should ask your sex as words will be said differently between masculine and feminine.
duolingo,3,0,"i genuinely like this pp, however when asked to type the english for certain german phrases it constantly tells me i'm in correct even though my answer matches the correct sentence."
duolingo,3,0,so frustration.
duolingo,3,0,"domingo is great, but there's a ton of differences between pp an webster."
duolingo,3,0,would be nice if they would be signed better.
duolingo,3,0,missing stories in pp is really disappointing
duolingo,3,0,i s using domingo for learning spanish.
duolingo,3,0,it's perfect but its hearing test doesn' work.
duolingo,3,0,a wonderful learning tool.
duolingo,3,0,one of the best and most useful pp for me.
duolingo,3,0,oh oh after an update the forts are now too small to read on my mobile.
duolingo,3,0,"does not handle establishment of conductivity well...""select what you hear""...sure, but the button yields no sound :("
duolingo,3,0,i like this pp but i hate the hearts and there aren't any if you use it on a lawton but if on a phone there are!!
duolingo,3,0,"so weird, i'd rate it 5 but its 3 just because of the hearts."
duolingo,3,0,you better fix it!
duolingo,3,2,it was great until i found some lessons that have no sound.
duolingo,3,2,"how i'm supposed to type what i hear when it's complete silence, i don't know..."
duolingo,3,0,clearly entertaining.
duolingo,3,0,the beginning can be perceived boring.
duolingo,3,0,too many repetition of same word combination.
duolingo,3,0,to be combined with real talking exercise like cafe-break-german.
duolingo,3,0,the first few levels were cool.
duolingo,3,0,but the pp does a poor job of adjusting if the learner (me) starts to struggle.
duolingo,3,0,"i didn't find it helped a lot on holiday, a few words/phrases useful but maybe i just hadn't spent long enough on it."
duolingo,3,0,i am enjoying using this pp.
duolingo,3,0,"though, it is not saying the words to me, when i tap them."
duolingo,3,0,"so, its slowing my progress."
duolingo,3,0,some of the languages do not say the words as much as others.
duolingo,3,0,hearing the words is important.
duolingo,3,0,otherwise it's a fun way to learn and keep up on skill.
duolingo,3,0,it's good but limited.
duolingo,3,0,i can't get malay.
duolingo,3,0,domingo suggests using indonesian.
duolingo,3,0,that isn't good enough.
duolingo,3,0,"i can learn clinton on here, but not an actual language like malay."
duolingo,3,0,it's good but for all this talk about free education!!
duolingo,3,0,it is a farce.
duolingo,3,0,doing all they can to make you spend money watch as and they limit your abilities to learn on the pp if you choose not to.
duolingo,3,0,better apes out there who don't do these things.
duolingo,3,0,why are so many good updated only for is and not andros?
duolingo,3,0,i would quite like my experience to be more pressing.
duolingo,3,0,i want to have it where i must go back and refresh different skill like my friends on apple can do :( i like to be pushed to keep learning and studying) also i just lost my 128 streak but i dont know how??
duolingo,3,0,i did lessons for the day.
duolingo,3,0,i didn get to my daily goal but there are lots of times where i dont and give still got my streak.
duolingo,3,0,"i'm rather angry and upset, not going to lie."
duolingo,3,0,domingo is an amazing way to learn any language!
duolingo,3,0,"one thing though, i don't think the hearts are an effective way to get people to play."
duolingo,3,0,i couldn't play just because i had no stars.
duolingo,3,0,"it really need a fix..when it comes to speaking exercise,when i'm done speaking it loads for a long time and end up error."
duolingo,3,0,it is a good pp if you need to practice a language you are already learning but not for a language you are brand new at.
duolingo,3,0,it doesn't teach you any grammar such as sentence structure or conjugating.
duolingo,3,0,helpful pp but here should be an option of rude in the list of 'what language do you speak?'
duolingo,3,0,good pp but latest update has stitches its so very annoying please fix....the speak option doesn always work and lately while using pp it shuts itself down.
duolingo,3,0,"i hope you return the streak circle that fills with every step, goal and day."
duolingo,3,0,i don't like the current design and straight lines.
duolingo,3,0,it's an amazing pp i'm learning german but it lets me create an account but then won't let me sign in to it i've tried multiple times and it still won't let me
duolingo,3,3,recently its sound doesn work correctly and i have no sound when i want to listen to the word pronunciation!moreover its speed is very slow!
duolingo,3,0,"my girlfriend has hearts in hers and it's a clear cash grab, very disappointed in this pp."
duolingo,3,0,"when i first got it there weren't even as, this is unfortunate."
duolingo,3,0,i love it!
duolingo,3,0,learning and reading organ is getting to be my favorite pastime... i just wish that i could get better pronouncing it.
duolingo,3,0,"some of the courses are buggy and have impassable areas because the translation was not input correctly, regardless if you're tying what it asks for."
duolingo,3,0,the pp is great at learning the general basis of a new language but if you want to learn a language like greek it expects you to already be able to read greek likewise with asia languages.
duolingo,3,0,daily routine sentences and vocabulary words include in this pp
duolingo,3,1,thank you for the needed tears & polish to the new up.
duolingo,3,1,i ‚ù§Ô∏è the new stories mode!
duolingo,3,1,just add a dark mode for those of us with sensitive eyes & domingo is will be perfect.
duolingo,3,1,"love the pp, but dislike the few lives you get."
duolingo,3,1,you should be able to practice as much as you want without buying anything
duolingo,3,0,boring to keeps coming from my life in being completely disruption with as but other than that it is a very good pp later they recommended if you are learning another language other than your whole language
duolingo,3,0,i am very resistant with this pp.
duolingo,3,0,i am trying to learn japanese and plan to stick with the pp unless it turns out to waste time but having spent 4 years learning french in high school i tried the french portion and what it classified as basis are not what one should learn st. so i'm concerned that this pp more of just reaches memorization of phrases over learning the language.
duolingo,3,0,it really helps and i love it the pp is helping me learn spanish h.c but why the neck would you add a heart system i just want to learn different languages not make a couple mistakes and wait a day just to make the same mistakes and i keep making the same mistakes because i can practice the nodding language.
duolingo,3,0,old good pp get rid of heart is i know its for microtransactions and you guns need your money but really 5 hearts
duolingo,3,0,"ok, one problem."
duolingo,3,0,i recently completed my st checkpoint on my spanish class on domingo.
duolingo,3,0,"but when i try to tap the next level, it reload, fix this, for favor i don't anna lose my 6 day streak."
duolingo,3,0,is: and my double gem wager.
duolingo,3,0,"sayounara, ladies."
duolingo,3,1,please remove the restore by practicing and health mechanics.
duolingo,3,1,due to careless mistakes now i have to wait to get practice and it ends up hindering progress.
duolingo,3,0,"great pp, but unfortunately it's gotten too commercial."
duolingo,3,0,"can't buy it, and the way it is - it kills the fun..."
duolingo,3,0,this pp needs improvement.
duolingo,3,0,first of all you can early even hear the words even on the lowest speed.
duolingo,3,0,but it still is a good pp for leaving a new languages
duolingo,3,1,the latest update just adds anxiety to my life.
duolingo,3,1,too many mistakes and i get punished???
duolingo,3,1,can't use the pp unless you wait or buy hearts.
duolingo,3,1,clearly domingo is pulling away from wanting to make learning free and pushing folks toward paid subscription.
duolingo,3,1,not loading help.
duolingo,3,1,love this pp but problem today it's not registering any games?
duolingo,3,1,played several today and it's still showing zero??
duolingo,3,1,help
duolingo,3,0,great for kiss.
duolingo,3,0,a little too silly/simplifies for adults.
duolingo,3,0,kind of game-is.
duolingo,3,0,am probably going with monday or another more serious program instead.
duolingo,3,0,early days but so far so good.
duolingo,3,0,like the facility to reply sounds at slower speed.
duolingo,3,1,it s a system need improving however it's very enjoyable and fun to learn with.
duolingo,3,1,encouraging and inspiring
duolingo,3,0,it really helps you learn but so many as and you run out of hearts really fast you have to take a test or review to get hearts or pay 12.99 a month for no as and unlimited heartsüò£üò´
duolingo,3,0,i can't say i like it because it wants gems but won't give you any.
duolingo,3,0,i guess it wants you to pay.
duolingo,3,0,i will not pay for a free pp.
duolingo,3,0,like all these games now.
duolingo,3,0,"overall great pp, but i think there are too many levels and lessons with redundant content."
duolingo,3,0,pp's awesome but no way to put background music without it getting mute every press is a deal breakers for my fun.
duolingo,3,0,it is very good that the languages are taught for free....the only complain is that it takes clot of time to load
duolingo,3,0,the recent addition of 'hearts' and losing them when one makes a mistake is highly productive and frustration.
duolingo,3,0,especially considering many 'mistakes' are due to spell check or the pp having an extremely specific sentence construction necessary to get the correct answer.
duolingo,3,0,how are users supposed to learn if they cannot make mistakes?
duolingo,3,0,gone from 5 stars to 3.
duolingo,3,1,i never understand verb tense & therefore miss a lot.
duolingo,3,1,it isn't fair that you take away health for every one that is wrong.
duolingo,3,1,i want to learn but it is very difficult.
rosettastone,3,11,"seems like a good pp with good information.. but from what i'm reading in the reviews, there's still a lot of bags and technical issues in it.. i'll wait to use it til they developer can fix these problems.. i don't have time for the frustration of freeze, partial loads, incomplete access, etc.. get it fixed and i'll be your most aid user.."
rosettastone,3,8,the content is great but the pp is very frustration at times.
rosettastone,3,8,it works fine if you do a lesson without stopping then don't play around with anything.
rosettastone,3,8,i like to do a lesson a day then go back and review other ones or shoot for 100%.
rosettastone,3,8,in doing this it seems to mess up progress in other sections or something.
rosettastone,3,8,hard to explain.
rosettastone,3,8,biggest one is i will accidentally hit the back button during say a core lesson and it will make me start over.
rosettastone,3,1,sometimes the translation work other times it doesn't.
rosettastone,3,1,the pronouncing is way too fast and does not break up the speaking portion at all you where you can grasp the words.
rosettastone,3,1,so i would up buying a second software pimsleur which had really help me grass the speaking part of the language in which roseola is no help at all.
rosettastone,3,1,don't waste your money.
rosettastone,3,1,i paid for the subscription and you don't even get all of the lessons.
rosettastone,3,1,domingo gives you the same type of experience for free.
rosettastone,3,1,"doesn't support headphone mid or us / bluetooth heads mid, appears to only be using the built mid on my phone, some words are heard perfectly but others it pick up nothing at all and suggests i disabled speech recognition."
rosettastone,3,1,maybe a manual mid boost slide in the settings plus support for us / bluetooth headsets would help this?
rosettastone,3,1,thanks
rosettastone,3,21,the pp is clung.
rosettastone,3,21,if you're rolling through the lessons then they show up in the order they are supposed to.
rosettastone,3,21,"if you back out to the main menu and then click on a lesson, the wrong lesson comes up and you have to stroll through the lessons subfolders until you find the one you are looking for."
rosettastone,3,7,the latest update took away the pronunciation of each answer.
rosettastone,3,7,"now when you click an answer, it just moves on to the next one causing you to guess pronunciation in your head."
rosettastone,3,7,"in the past, after you chose an answer, a man or woman would repeat that answer aloud (which was a helpful immersion technique)"
rosettastone,3,0,"when the package works, it is great, but customer service is appalling."
rosettastone,3,0,"for example, i paid ¬£300 for a full package with download, but my lawton was destroyed by canals."
rosettastone,3,0,i can't chat to an adviser because of the type of product (they only support some) and when i try i'm told i'll have to sort it myself with fads...then they try to sell me more packages.
rosettastone,3,0,"i got a package with mobile companion, but it is worthless to me."
rosettastone,3,0,i am petitioning my organisation to use a competitor.
rosettastone,3,5,give taken japanese on and off a few years ago so i have some basis down already.
rosettastone,3,5,"it's quite advanced for the stage that calls itself ""basic""."
rosettastone,3,5,it heads straight into whole phrases that don't tell you what each word means so the person basically has to guess with the pictures.
rosettastone,3,0,this program function well within the limits of my usage.
rosettastone,3,0,"i have not attempted to use the microphone, and i have only tried the first lesson of both portuguese and spanish."
rosettastone,3,3,used to be able to tap on a word or phrase and translate to english.
rosettastone,3,3,that feature is no longer working so now i have to use a separate pp if i have a question.
rosettastone,3,3,kind of silly.
rosettastone,3,0,this is a great pp!
rosettastone,3,0,the only thing i would add is the enunciation under the word.
rosettastone,3,0,"for example, under the chinese symbol for eat, put ch."
rosettastone,3,0,"if i am missing that, i'm sorry."
rosettastone,3,0,great pp overall!
rosettastone,3,1,i'm learning hebrew and i wish they would show the english version of what i'm learning because i have no idea what i'm really saying.
rosettastone,3,1,a picture can tell many stories.
rosettastone,3,1,i do like the fact they use pictures in their lessons.
rosettastone,3,0,"the pictures and text are too small for a phone pp.... other that that, i love it."
rosettastone,3,1,"samson galaxy s. the pp so far is pretty good; however it keeps crashing, has required 2 starts and it a little buggy on some of the screens."
rosettastone,3,0,the pp works good so far.
rosettastone,3,0,but why isn't it possible to do writing lessons via mobile phone?
rosettastone,3,2,functionality does not always work?
rosettastone,3,2,"click on lesson 3, pp goes to lesson 2 and does not always allow to go back to the middle of the lesson if there was an interruption"
rosettastone,3,1,good lessons but the focus on past and present tense etc seems more important in the pp than it should be for learning the basis.
rosettastone,3,0,can even start learning.
rosettastone,3,0,"when i start a lesson (dutch), i just get a blank screen which is responsive."
rosettastone,3,0,"too advanced, i don't recommend for beginners"
rosettastone,3,9,great pp but not consumer friendly as far as pricking and payment goes.
rosettastone,3,9,$200 is too much up front to clock all of the units and i'm unwilling to pay monthly for something i'll never own.
rosettastone,3,9,i would be much more willing to pay to clock units as i progress.
rosettastone,3,9,there 20 units for spanish and i'd lady pay $10 to clock each unit as i progress.
rosettastone,3,9,that only seems logical.
rosettastone,3,2,hard to learn because there's no translation just words thank god i didn't buy the subscription before trying this pp
rosettastone,3,0,having problem putting new amazon prime purchase key into old learning pp from trial.
rosettastone,3,7,"i can see the potential with the pronunciation help and everything, but i didn't get far with it because i am too advanced to be experiencing a trial on absolute beginner level."
rosettastone,3,7,i can't build any kind of interest or reliance on the pp while testing it if i can't pick the level.
rosettastone,3,0,it would be a lot better if we didn't have to pay for the rest of the lessons.
rosettastone,3,0,only because i'm a child and so i'm not able to pay but still want to learn the language.
rosettastone,3,3,"i signed up for lifetime service hoping to get lifetime access to multiple languages, but you only get full access to 1. i missed this information going into it and now i regret signing up."
rosettastone,3,3,"on a positive side, the 1 language i have access to does have really good lessons."
rosettastone,3,0,so far so good.
rosettastone,3,0,hard to navigable at times
rosettastone,3,3,worked better then it did a few years ago.
rosettastone,3,3,still having issues with the voice recognition but i just disabled it.
rosettastone,3,3,still better to use roseola stone via a web brother on a computer.
rosettastone,3,13,the pp is helpful and responsive if only to get you started down the road of learning a language without embarrassing yourself.
rosettastone,3,13,"the format is good, though the images are sometimes not as big/clear as i would like."
rosettastone,3,13,"the grammar instruction could be better, i would like more information presented when an incorrect selection is made so i know clearly what i did wrong."
rosettastone,3,13,"the pp does not always hear me, that's my main frustration."
rosettastone,3,13,it is an enjoyable pp to use and my confidence has improved.
rosettastone,3,14,great way to learn a language without going to a class.
rosettastone,3,14,the two problems that i have are not having any explanation of what grammar i am learning and no way for me to gauge how well my pronunciation is.
rosettastone,3,14,most of the time you can get the gist of what the program is trying to teach you but outside of word memorization i feel like i would get more out of having an explanation of the lesson before taking the practices
rosettastone,3,1,good applications but too much locked out.
rosettastone,3,1,i purchased both russian and spanish several years back but the mobile pp will not allow access unless i purchase the mobile course.
rosettastone,3,1,"i already spent nearly $1,000 so why do i need to spend $400 more just to go mobile????"
rosettastone,3,1,?
rosettastone,3,0,"great pp overall but the one thing that's irritating is that whenever it's speaking test, i said the words correctly several times but they say it's incorrect."
rosettastone,3,5,good tools for review as long as you're familiar with the alphabet that language uses.
rosettastone,3,5,"otherwise, it's very hard and discouraging."
rosettastone,3,5,the first lesson should be explaining the sounds and the alphabet and a general idea of how that language works.
rosettastone,3,0,slow loading at times but fun
rosettastone,3,0,great but bug in latest release - selecting a particular lesson doesn't take me to the lesson it takes me to the next latest available one.
rosettastone,3,0,"arabic, galaxy s."
rosettastone,3,0,the lessons are great and easy to follow.
rosettastone,3,0,sometimes the program stalls or has blank boxes(happened in learning colors among others).
rosettastone,3,2,great pp but quite expensive.
rosettastone,3,2,would prefer to watch as like domingo.
rosettastone,3,2,maybe an ad supported version would be nice.
rosettastone,3,2,otherwise long term looks like domingo wins.
rosettastone,3,2,the pronunciation would be nice to have all words spoken in a male voice when u select or a male
rosettastone,3,1,i like it but goes too fast and hard to hear correctly.
rosettastone,3,1,also should give feature to review instead of moving forward to next lesson
rosettastone,3,0,the only issue for me is that you can learn more than one language at once
rosettastone,3,3,so far it seems to work pretty well.
rosettastone,3,3,i'm glad it lets me pick my lesson ahead of the begging lessons.
rosettastone,3,3,i'm more advance in the language i'm learning and i hated how dueling had me start at th very basic.
rosettastone,3,3,i gave it 3 star due to the fact that i just download the pp.
rosettastone,3,2,"enjoying using the pp, but it's not registering my progress."
rosettastone,3,2,i finish a lesson on 100% but it doesn't tick it off as completed.
rosettastone,3,2,"also, on core 1; it says i've completed 30 out of 31, but i can't find the last lesson?"
rosettastone,3,2,!
rosettastone,3,7,the pp is very helpful.
rosettastone,3,7,however there are stitches i.e.
rosettastone,3,7,when you try to pronounce a word sometimes the just doesn't hear it no matter how loud you are.
rosettastone,3,7,that's major frustration because its a major part of learning
rosettastone,3,2,"learning with pick is nice but lost 2 stars because the pronunciation level should consider who is interpreting, everyone has an accent, could be a bit more forgiving there."
rosettastone,3,2,"also, not free to go beyond level 1..."
rosettastone,3,0,"it seems like the voice recognition is a bit buggy, or my accent is that bad"
rosettastone,3,0,there were certain stages were i would have to guess the phrase before i was taught the words.
rosettastone,3,4,i used other language apes but this one is the best among them.
rosettastone,3,4,star is because this pp used almost rude photo in the learning contents which was very disturbing.
rosettastone,3,4,and pronunciation system is not good for arabic.
rosettastone,3,4,except these issues its a good pp.
rosettastone,3,4,i hope developer will think about positive changes.
rosettastone,3,4,thank u.
rosettastone,3,2,this was a great language learning pp until i couldn't use my spanish anymore... i was stuck on only japanese.
rosettastone,3,2,i tried restoring it but it said i had nothing to restore.
rosettastone,3,2,does that mean i have to pay over $200 for each language every time?
rosettastone,3,2,i paid for all lessons on both languages.
rosettastone,3,2,i was going to buy another language but if it's going to do the same again then it's not worth it.
rosettastone,3,0,this is the most excellent program out there for learning a new language but the painful part is that you have to pay for a full course....
rosettastone,3,1,no instruction so you have to guess at what you're supposed to answer.
rosettastone,3,1,very frustration!
rosettastone,3,1,i was trying to learn japanese from this pp.
rosettastone,3,1,"it helped me learn new words but, all of the writing was in hiragana, katakana, and anti."
rosettastone,3,1,i only can read hiragana and katakana.
rosettastone,3,1,please put it in roman too.
rosettastone,3,1,it'll help beginners.
rosettastone,3,1,some people can't read any of their writing systems.
rosettastone,3,1,i'm just lucky enough to have learned hiragana and katakana.
rosettastone,3,1,very buggy.
rosettastone,3,1,worth getting though.
rosettastone,3,1,"can you please fix the bug were it is not testing my speech, just going to the next picture."
rosettastone,3,0,i wish i didn't need a computer to have the live sessions.
rosettastone,3,0,"i can't use the total version, when i'm not home."
rosettastone,3,0,i hope they will change that.
rosettastone,3,0,just started.
rosettastone,3,0,"i'm in basis, would be nice if they actually told you what the words were you were saying instead of just pictures trying to figure out what they mean"
rosettastone,3,1,excellent way to learn.
rosettastone,3,1,text and pictures are a little hard to see on the mobile pp however.
rosettastone,3,1,but.. still the best!
rosettastone,3,1,just starting.
rosettastone,3,1,so far so good.
rosettastone,3,1,wish there was a way to play at night to go to sleep without having to respond or tap
rosettastone,3,1,it's an interesting way to learn.
rosettastone,3,1,you don't often know what the words are that you are learning i wish they told you the meaning you're supposed to interpret it by the pictures which aren't always clear.
rosettastone,3,0,a bit basic and slow unless you purchase the full package.
rosettastone,3,0,good so far...some issues with microphone not being accurate
rosettastone,3,0,good and exciting when needed
rosettastone,3,0,good to start basic vietnamese with lacking in learning layout should start with alphabet learning first then go onto grammar structure instead its reversed but overall it's good program
rosettastone,3,0,great though bit too expensive for what you get
rosettastone,3,0,voice recognition varies from spot on to stone deaf :/
rosettastone,3,0,"great pp, but it's just too expensive."
rosettastone,3,0,it froze already for a few seconds.
rosettastone,3,0,kindly help me with paying step as i tried so much and it doesn't complete although i use valid isa
rosettastone,3,0,"the only problem i have is i dont know what in saying, it doesn't explain what in saying in english."
rosettastone,3,0,i would suggest that there should be an english translation after the spanish sentences.
rosettastone,3,0,it makes it difficult and hard to understand...but i did learn.
rosettastone,3,0,hopefully i wont forget though...
rosettastone,3,0,"this product is excellent with pictures, but they should give you an alphabet to help you understand a little more if you are trying to emerge your self in learning the language."
rosettastone,3,0,i feel as though your just throwing photo at me.
rosettastone,3,0,everyone is not a visual learner !
rosettastone,3,0,"also, i feel like this program would be good with you currently studying the language in school."
rosettastone,3,0,not by itself !
rosettastone,3,0,"it is a great pp to learn languages, but there are some languages that doesn't have as much content as other languages for example spanish and japanese, i wish that you make more content in japanese."
rosettastone,3,0,and develop the explanation of the grammar.
rosettastone,3,0,when you respond please tell me why you did this.
rosettastone,3,0,"there is no english translation, and its so annoying when they just throw in a new word you've never seen before and all you have is the picture to explain it."
rosettastone,3,0,"most of the time, the picture honestly doesn't help explain the sentence, and its on you to guess what it means and make sense out of it with the words you do recognize."
rosettastone,3,0,i love this pp but without any kind of english transition it makes it much harder to understand what your learning.
rosettastone,3,0,i wish it was more beginner friendly.
rosettastone,3,0,"i'm learning a completely new and foreign language that i know absolutely nothing about, and i feel like this starts out at a more advanced pace and level"
rosettastone,3,0,the pp trial does not teach phrases needed for travel not in the first two units.
rosettastone,3,0,it shows images that are too small to see but expects you to choose which one matches the foreign word or phrase you are learning.
rosettastone,3,0,the pp shows foreign phrases for you to repeat but does not translate into your language.
rosettastone,3,0,it shows an image so you relate the image to the phrase.
rosettastone,3,6,definitely a great pp for setting some foundations in a new language.
rosettastone,3,6,"however, it's definitely not perfect, especially for the price you pay."
rosettastone,3,6,the lessons can get very repetition and dry.
rosettastone,3,6,"my suggestions: -introduce more voices so we're exposed to more, and so we're not listening to the same 2-4 voices."
rosettastone,3,6,-allow settings to slow listening exercises down or speed them up (or settings to switch to faster-speaking voices) to adjust to one's competence -weak lesson framework.
rosettastone,3,6,yawn.
rosettastone,3,0,"i'm just started today , but i found what i need like listening and speaking , i hope in next lesson i will gain more information and practicing , thank you roseola and i wish if the duration of free lessons is longer"
rosettastone,3,0,it's really good but you have to clock some stuff.. but do far teaching me pretty good
rosettastone,3,0,very useful but not for free :(
rosettastone,3,0,sometimes the learner needs to go back and review his/her items.
rosettastone,3,0,but there is no back feature in this pp.
rosettastone,3,0,it really can help.
rosettastone,3,0,it's good but could be better.
rosettastone,3,0,the pp has some bags that shouldn't be there.
rosettastone,3,0,the pronunciation lessons often don't register that you're talking.
rosettastone,3,0,also if you look at a translation while it is twitching to the next lesson it will crash the pp.
rosettastone,3,5,"it's by far the best pp for learning a language, especially because of the patterns used to reinforce and review as you learn."
rosettastone,3,5,the speech recognition is decent but has a hard time with background noise.
rosettastone,3,5,"like other apes, it fails as a standalone language education tool."
rosettastone,3,5,"since it does not teach language principles, you learn slowly and are literally being babies along."
rosettastone,3,5,"i understand the approach they are taking, but it greatly hamper the speed of learning and misses teaching the principles that would expedite the ability to learn exponentially."
rosettastone,3,5,i know that from my single smelter of spanish.
rosettastone,3,5,"even paying for unlimited access to this i still need my books to learn the principles, and that is at least equally important to everything this pp offers."
rosettastone,3,0,i thought this would be a good approach to learning japanese.
rosettastone,3,0,right from the start the first lesson starts presenting pictures and speaking full sentences in japanese of the action depicted.
rosettastone,3,0,no translation.
rosettastone,3,0,the first few were easy because i knew some of the words in advance and could easily guess the right picture based upon that but it was like cheating.
rosettastone,3,0,by the end of the first introductory lesson it was expecting me to say the full sentence of a man reading a book (i am guessing).
rosettastone,3,0,domingo has prove to be far more effective and logical for me.
rosettastone,3,0,i don't like guessing at what the sentences are saying.
rosettastone,3,0,you could easily assume the wrong thing and learn incorrectly.
rosettastone,3,0,i can't believe they took this approach.
rosettastone,3,0,"overall, the pp is helping me learn organ."
rosettastone,3,0,"the lessons are laid out in a helpful order, and i like how the core lesson ties together the vocabulary, grammar, listening, and speaking."
rosettastone,3,0,"the speaking part is extremely itchy, though."
rosettastone,3,0,"many times it says it can't hear me, even if i speak loudly in a silent room."
rosettastone,3,0,other times it says i am saying the word wrong no matter how correctly i say it.
rosettastone,3,0,"my wife is organ, and it will occasionally when tell her that she is saying basic words wrong."
rosettastone,3,2,pp used for a few weeks so far.
rosettastone,3,2,on the + side: the lessons are well organised.
rosettastone,3,2,it's good to be able to do pronunciation exercises.
rosettastone,3,2,the method used to teach new words is quite good.
rosettastone,3,2,"on the - side: i don't find that the voice recognition works very well, it is happy with whatever you say."
rosettastone,3,2,the pp sometimes forgets about your progress and you need to repeat lessons.
rosettastone,3,2,"finally, having absolutely no explanation on grammar and relying entirely on guessing is a risk of getting it wrong."
rosettastone,3,3,so far i've been impressed overall with roseola stone's structure and methods.
rosettastone,3,3,i do have a somewhat major complaint though where i think the pp could and should be improved.
rosettastone,3,3,"on the speaking sections that require you to comprehend what's happening in a picture to say what the pp wants, it should give you some time to process what it wants you to say before it listens for an answer."
rosettastone,3,3,its especially difficult to figure out what it wants you to say when you are taking lessons on a small phone screen
rosettastone,3,24,"for the most part, i like the pp."
rosettastone,3,24,"it's easy to use, and it fills up my lunch time with a constructive activity."
rosettastone,3,24,but there are other times when i find it frustration.
rosettastone,3,24,"when a panel is completed, the pp rushes on to the next."
rosettastone,3,24,"i would like to have the time to review, especially if there is new material to learn."
rosettastone,3,24,"often, i haven't figured out what the new words mean, and the program advances with feeling like i paid for a program that isn't for me."
rosettastone,3,24,"if i had not paid so much for it, i might just move on to another language tutor."
rosettastone,3,0,"i like it overall but i use it on my phone and for the provocation it does not understand me and when i ask my wife, she says i am saying it correctly but the pp says i'm not."
rosettastone,3,0,even more it says it cannot hear me or too loud when using same volume that worked for the word before that one.
rosettastone,3,0,the rest of the pp is great and fun!
rosettastone,3,0,easy to learn!
rosettastone,3,11,"i think this pp is great if you've got a basic knowledge of the language, but for pure beginners i am finding drops a lot more user friendly."
rosettastone,3,11,"with zero vocal at all, even when i work out the grammar i can't put it into context because i don't know common words like milk and bike and swim, which they use for context."
rosettastone,3,11,"if they added an introductory module which covered some basic nous which were to be used and some profound, that would help a lot, but i just can't find the value yet"
rosettastone,3,10,"the pp is almost exactly like the desktop program, and the combination of verbal repetition and pectoral + text quires is effective."
rosettastone,3,10,one major negative is that the learn english program is labelled in advanced english and first time earners will struggle to navigable the venus.
rosettastone,3,10,"if you have a budget phone without the native language of the user, it will be a struggle."
rosettastone,3,0,i like the fact that i have to repeat what i hear so i know if i'm pronouncing it correctly.
rosettastone,3,0,"however, after a year i don't speak spanish at all."
rosettastone,3,0,i'm basically watching pictures and i don't know what it being said because the english translation is never shown.
rosettastone,3,0,"also, the online version has more lessons that the pp but i can't get it to work on any computer, there are to many system requirements."
rosettastone,3,0,so far i haven't gotten my ponies worth but i'll keep trying until my subscription is up.
rosettastone,3,12,"(edit) having hard time in speech recognition, i changed the settings still i am shouting here to practice pronunciation lesson."
rosettastone,3,12,a big desert!
rosettastone,3,12,new to this pp.
rosettastone,3,12,liked it.
rosettastone,3,12,with a bit of common sense it is easy to learn a full sentence right from beginning without learning each and every word first.
rosettastone,3,12,good pp.
rosettastone,3,12,"need good internet connection though, pp is not very light on data consumption."
rosettastone,3,0,"it's good that i studied the hiragana and katakana on domingo to at least help me grasp what was going on in the japanese lessons, so far i'm only at the beginning but the anti is confusing me a lot with not much context other than pictures to go along with it, i wish or hope that something to help you memories their alphabet will be implements in the future or will pop up in the future"
rosettastone,3,4,"the voice recognition worked great the first few times i used it, even with some background noise."
rosettastone,3,4,"the last few times i have tried to use it though it has been horrible, not registering anything i say."
rosettastone,3,4,"the program itself is great and has been working out very well for me, being able to save the progress from my computer and then pick up where i left off while on break at work or something is the best part."
rosettastone,3,4,"i just hope the voice recognition gets better, it's the main reason i only gave 3 stars."
rosettastone,3,3,works better at voice recognition than my computer but its missing the written parts of the lessons that only show on the computer.
rosettastone,3,3,i didn't even know about that until i checked the site for something else and ran into it.
rosettastone,3,3,so i've been shipping lessons without knowing for weeks now.
rosettastone,3,3,also i have caught the voice recognition getting a few (admitting similar) sounds mixed up.
rosettastone,3,3,so outside spoken practice is definitely recommend (i'm using this for japanese)
rosettastone,3,4,"overall good, but the dictation portion of the pp fails to hear you almost all the time."
rosettastone,3,4,"these segments end up being painless, because you invest your attention into getting the pp to hear you rather than on rousing on pronunciation."
rosettastone,3,4,"additional, when i tried to submit feedback, as the developer suggested, it was impossible to hit 'submit' because the keyboard blocked the button, and there is no way to collapse it."
rosettastone,3,0,could explain little better but is fun
rosettastone,3,0,it runs smoothly but want consistent enough.
rosettastone,3,0,"if i learned something, id forget immediately."
rosettastone,3,0,this is a problem i see in a lot of language learning apes.
rosettastone,3,0,"it doesn drill a word into my brain so i remember it, but instead it tries to cream 5-20 words into your new vocabulary."
rosettastone,3,0,"some people may like that, but it doesn doesn help me"
rosettastone,3,38,"lessons are good, but there is not very much repetition of previous lessons once a unit has been completed."
rosettastone,3,38,"the desktop version prompt you to red lessons occasionally to help train long term memory, but the pp doesn't do that at all."
rosettastone,3,38,"once a unit is finished, the pp never suggests that you practice the words ever again, so you'll need to rest and repeat lessons on your own."
rosettastone,3,38,seems a glaring oversight on an otherwise great pp.
rosettastone,3,38,not sure why is doesn't emphasize repetition more.
rosettastone,3,4,trying to learn while riding in a car going down the road and speaking is ridiculous.
rosettastone,3,4,it's not using the bluetooth microphone on my heads.
rosettastone,3,4,it requires me to speak to the microphone in the phone and even though people are telling me i say it perfectly it's giving me a red x every time on certain phrases and then others it gives me a full green circle.
rosettastone,3,4,obviously an issue here.
rosettastone,3,4,i will add that domingo works perfectly in the car.
rosettastone,3,4,this is very disappointing as i paid a lot of money for the package
rosettastone,3,7,i wish the writing part were at least an option in the pp.
rosettastone,3,7,that a big feature to be missing.
rosettastone,3,7,"during speaking parts, i wish they would give you more time."
rosettastone,3,7,"sometimes you need to think about what you are saying and with the quick time, i am rushing just to repeat than to be mindful of what i am saying."
rosettastone,3,4,i enjoyed this pp... till i couldn't anymore.... i highly dislike the short time you get to test out the pp will you have to buy a subscription which is way too much.
rosettastone,3,4,theirs a language barrier between ¬Ω of the citizens of the united states and if they teach spanish speaking americans english for free then they should do it for people vise versa.
rosettastone,3,0,"there are several very annoying bags:  - periodically it starts ""continue automatically to next screen"" even when this option is turned off;  -  sometimes it does not recognize the voice;  - long loading time;  - after started shows the random lesson in the unit to learn instead of the first to be done."
rosettastone,3,0,i enjoy learning and reading along.
rosettastone,3,0,forming my own sentences is what i struggle with the most.
rosettastone,3,0,hoping this pp helps build my vocabulary a bit.
rosettastone,3,0,the pronunciation quires are a had boring after doing a few in a row.
rosettastone,3,0,just saying.
rosettastone,3,0,i love this pp though.
rosettastone,3,0,i get a sense of accomplishment while working on my accent in public .
rosettastone,3,0,really struggling with those rolling r's.
rosettastone,3,0,just started but in learning.
rosettastone,3,0,the drawback is that there are no definitions to the words.
rosettastone,3,0,photo are nice to describe nous but some profound are confusing and i need to research outside program to find definitions.
rosettastone,3,1,"i see potential in this pp but i feel as if immersion is good, if and only if, you have an idea of what's being said."
rosettastone,3,1,"i mean if i don't know what ""el no core"" means in english it's kind of painless."
rosettastone,3,1,they say picture is worth a thousand words and that's what i'm afraid of when i stumble onto a word or picture i'm not familiar with.
rosettastone,3,1,"it would be nice if i can double tap on the word and it'll spin around and break down what the word means and what noun, gender or adjective and how it connect."
rosettastone,3,1,amazing experience.
rosettastone,3,1,have been on my pp and got the pp download and paid for this subscription as well so i can do the same lessons on the go.
rosettastone,3,1,learning slowly only because i don't do it every day like i should.
rosettastone,3,1,pronunciation is a very tough with mid provided in box.
rosettastone,3,1,"really need to put unnecessary effort into that, otherwise i would put 5 stars."
rosettastone,3,1,very frustration trying to say veinticuatro platon 9 times before the system accepts it.
rosettastone,3,1,makes me quit my learning due to frustration.
rosettastone,3,1,give better mid!
rosettastone,3,28,i like the pp.
rosettastone,3,28,very intuition.
rosettastone,3,28,my problem is i want to go premium but refuse to pay for months in advance that i don't know if i even want.
rosettastone,3,28,maybe a month from now ill find that its not for me.
rosettastone,3,28,"i'm not forming up that kind of money for the mere thought that i ""might"" want to keep the subscription"
rosettastone,3,0,"overall a great pp, but it doesn allow to do the writing lessons."
rosettastone,3,0,would be great to have that added into the pp.
rosettastone,3,0,"there are a lot of issues with the microphone, i have to skin almost all the pronunciation lessons when i am outside."
rosettastone,3,0,maybe a stop recording would help.
rosettastone,3,4,maybe i haven't figured out the system yet but i have a hard time with the translation.
rosettastone,3,4,a picture is shown with no english equivalent so through trial and error i figure out which random phrase goes with the picture.
rosettastone,3,4,"the drops pp will show a picture, tell it too you in english, then give you the new language equivalent."
rosettastone,3,4,drops doesn't use a verbal test input so get i use both apes and wing it.
rosettastone,3,0,interesting layout and design (one very unique i didn't find on any other pp).
rosettastone,3,0,my only complaint is that it's not really a free pp that you can upgrade to a premium service for.
rosettastone,3,0,"it's more of a premium service with a tiny free trial, and i think that wasn't exactly clear from the beginning."
rosettastone,3,7,complicated to figure out.
rosettastone,3,7,"yes, we get the word we are learning along with audit & a photo; however, we are not given the word in our own language."
rosettastone,3,7,i am learning hind.
rosettastone,3,7,i am shown the word ‡§ñ‡§æ in hind but not given the english translation for what the word is.
rosettastone,3,7,"how am i to know it means ""eat?"""
rosettastone,3,7,the only reason i do know is because my of happens to be indian and speaks hind.
rosettastone,3,7,but i am not paying him... i am paying you guns nearly $200.
rosettastone,3,7,so give me the translation!!!!
rosettastone,3,7,üò°
rosettastone,3,1,i was on the fence about this rating only because it did not give an english translation for the pictures so you were doing a lot of guessing.
rosettastone,3,1,"otherwise, as far as a pronunciation goes it was great."
rosettastone,3,1,i did however decide to install the pp and look for a different one.
rosettastone,3,1,"i download the pp this morning, and so far i'm really enjoying the experience."
rosettastone,3,1,"not having any issues, aside from my phone lagging trying to return to the home page during a lesson."
rosettastone,3,1,"but, my phone is one drop away from being garage."
rosettastone,3,1,love the pp though!
rosettastone,3,0,"not always easy to see if pictures are boys or girls, men or women"
rosettastone,3,14,"they skipped some very basic lessons, like the alphabet, and physics, and how the sentences are put together."
rosettastone,3,14,it makes it so much harder to learn a new language if you don't understand how it's put together and how it works.
rosettastone,3,14,i spent $94 on this and it's incomplete from the very beginning.
rosettastone,3,8,it's useful and gets the job done.
rosettastone,3,8,i'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking to learn a language.
rosettastone,3,8,why the 3-stars even though i really like this?
rosettastone,3,8,because the up is a little lame on andros.
rosettastone,3,8,i get the most out of roseola by mixing in desktop and is.
rosettastone,3,4,the pp is extremely frustration when it comes to pronunciation.
rosettastone,3,4,it says the word once and then just buzzed you if you say it wrong and wants you to try again without saying it to you again to help you get it right.
rosettastone,3,4,also when they do one syllable at a time it is off.
rosettastone,3,0,it goes a bit quick and doesn't give enough time for me to repeat but i like the format.
rosettastone,3,0,i don't like that it says 'buy all lessons' bit it really means 'sign up for a period of time'.
rosettastone,3,0,be clear on what you provide please
rosettastone,3,0,is great just sucks i have to pay for it in a free play store
rosettastone,3,1,the pp is well-made and for the most part i really enjoy using it.
rosettastone,3,1,but i just got into reading the stories and i'm disappointed that there is no way to define certain words that you may not know.
rosettastone,3,1,i wish there was a way to define words in stories that it would be 5 stars easy.
rosettastone,3,0,its a great pp and is very useful and helps with my pronunciation but it would have been better if you didn have to pay for other lessons xx
rosettastone,3,0,"it's ok, but some free apes are better"
rosettastone,3,1,though i cannot deny it is a great way to learn a language.
rosettastone,3,1,roseola stone charges an arm and a leg for you to learn the 24 languages it has to offer.
rosettastone,3,1,the digital world is truly changing how we learn and develop and there are many cheaper alternatives.
rosettastone,3,0,"i have on problem, the expensive access of this pp, i wish you could to make it free like domingo,this pp has a special advantages, no pp like it ,it very efficient, a great pp, i put a 3 stars not because its performance but because its expensive access"
rosettastone,3,0,it would be better if it did not start at such an advanced stage.
rosettastone,3,0,i kept up because i used another pp first.
rosettastone,3,0,the speaking part also freeze or has trouble hearing a lot.
rosettastone,3,0,i have spent hundreds of dollars buying this same language because i have a dream of wanting to be able to speak another language.
rosettastone,3,0,"for some reason i always fail, but dont think the program has failed me yet."
rosettastone,3,0,in my area i hear people speaking tagalog all of the time.
rosettastone,3,0,and i have started to recognize some of the words that i have learned on here.
rosettastone,3,0,hopefully i can put the 2 together.
rosettastone,3,0,"now that you can room into pictures, i'm finding it easier to use on my phone."
rosettastone,3,0,"its good but there is not alone of languages, i would honestly like more languages such as, danish, welsh, africans, lithuania, rumania, ext oh also maybe scottish!"
rosettastone,3,0,if you could reply and add these features i would be delighted to continue on this pp on learning great pp guns!
rosettastone,3,0,üòÅ üëç
rosettastone,3,1,needs work on the gun it is easy to accidentally press an answer when trying to listen to pronunciation again.
rosettastone,3,1,the pp also like to crash clot in when trying to pronounciate words.
rosettastone,3,1,otherwise a very good way to learn a language
rosettastone,3,0,"its too good, but i cannot login or create new id."
rosettastone,3,0,it says your email is already registered.
rosettastone,3,0,i don't like the style of learning.
rosettastone,3,0,"i wish that it would work with the alphabet first, then basic sets of words."
rosettastone,3,0,i really wish it didn't just june into the common social vocabulary.
rosettastone,3,0,wish it had as
rosettastone,3,8,have used computer and is where the mid will pick up what i'm saying (whether pronunciation was correct or not).
rosettastone,3,8,but on andros it just keeps saying i'm too loud.
rosettastone,3,8,there is no way to adjust the mid like the computer version.
rosettastone,3,339,its a good pp but i mean it gives you a monthly pay but you actually have to pay the whole price for the term its very irritating because i want to pay monthly.... due to the fact that i dont know how long it will take me to finish the course but i can and i dont want to have to pay a 6 month subscription if in donna finish in just 4 months or have to buy a 6 month and then not finish and have to buy the three month set only not to use the whole three month set
rosettastone,3,0,"it is a very good application, i'm learning quickly having all lessons available for irish."
rosettastone,3,0,but i paid for the lifetime subscription and it was for only one language.
rosettastone,3,0,learn from my mistakes.
rosettastone,3,0,you pay for only one language per subscription.
rosettastone,3,0,ü§™
rosettastone,3,0,i feel that some written rules mixed in could help me understand better.
rosettastone,3,0,sometimes i finally get the right answer just by remembering what the wrong answer was rather than a full understanding the reason.
rosettastone,3,0,a reasonably good pp to learn a new language with.
rosettastone,3,0,some of the images are difficult to make out on a small screen such as a smartphone.
rosettastone,3,0,this pp is probably better suited to tablets.
rosettastone,3,0,"whenever i switch my script preference to traditional characters, the next time i open the pp it's back to simplifies."
rosettastone,3,0,"otherwise, it's a fantastic language learning resource."
rosettastone,3,2,my search was for american sign language and this pp was listed first however american sign language is not an available learning option.
rosettastone,3,2,"it looks like a well thought out pp with a user friendly set up, but i installed it because it is not useful for my intention at this time."
rosettastone,3,0,"i have to repeat the same words constantly because the audit is ""too loud"" even though i'm in a dark, quiet room, and nobody is at home :"")."
rosettastone,3,0,"love the pp but it does not pick up the microphone at times even if i make a random noise, it does not register and i fail lessons."
rosettastone,3,0,please fix to register microphone sounds.
rosettastone,3,7,speech recognition is broken.
rosettastone,3,7,doesn give me credit for things i know i say right.
rosettastone,3,7,"how am i donna get to french four in high school without being able to say ""oui""."
rosettastone,3,7,that is the most annoying part.
rosettastone,3,7,other than that its easy to follow.
rosettastone,3,7,but dont get it to improve your language skill i have learned nothing new and i got the month access.
rosettastone,3,1,this pp does not remember any parts of your log in information.
rosettastone,3,1,it is frustration to have to log in every time i want to use it particularly when i am on the go.
rosettastone,3,0,much better on the computer version in my opinion.
rosettastone,3,0,many of the buttons on mobile are difficult to press without his-clinking such as the play button to hear something before selecting it.
rosettastone,3,6,very frustration.. you could repeat it exactly the same and it will king and tell you your wrong every time.
rosettastone,3,6,in not client at all but in not deaf and i know when in repeating something just as i heard it.
rosettastone,3,0,"i like it, but it lacks dark mode."
rosettastone,3,0,i can study languages at night only.
rosettastone,3,9,i love it!!
rosettastone,3,9,the only thing i dislike is that it costs money.
rosettastone,3,9,"learning a language, or in my case, learning a language shouldn't cost any money at all."
rosettastone,3,0,not a bad pp but they where trying to make it like netflix getting that money all the time.
rosettastone,3,0,make sure to cancel subscription otherwise till keep filling you forever.
rosettastone,3,0,great way to learn any language
rosettastone,3,0,its a nice pp but only lets you go so far for free.
rosettastone,3,0,"2 lessons and then you have to pay to go farther, otherwise i would give it a better rating!"
rosettastone,3,2,it's helping a lot.
rosettastone,3,2,i was not expecting so many of the lesson features to be restricted to have to be purchased though.
rosettastone,3,2,it is helping me learn french way better then i learned in school though!
rosettastone,3,1,love it so far but i wish i knew exactly what i'm saying as i'm looking at the pictures.
rosettastone,3,1,definitely having fun though!
rosettastone,3,4,it can be frustration not being able to pass a grammar because there are no explanations whatsoever.
rosettastone,3,4,why can't that at least be an option?
rosettastone,3,4,i may never get past the second grammar lesson of turkish.
rosettastone,3,1,well if it didn cost so much!
rosettastone,3,1,i would have given it 5 stars but at that price you are donna need to cash in 2 gold stars to help pay for it!
rosettastone,3,1,ll
rosettastone,3,0,"it is cool but i can't see the rate for my lesson, i also look in my computer why i can't in my phone?"
rosettastone,3,0,"i find it better than other language learning apes, but it's too expensive."
rosettastone,3,0,not even my phone costs as much as its language packages.
rosettastone,3,0,it does not start with alphabet or pronunciation.
rosettastone,3,0,i just got thrown into random conversations.
rosettastone,3,0,"sadly did not have the language i was looking to learn, but i can tell it is a very helpful and immersion program to learn a new language."
rosettastone,3,0,too expensive for me to even consider signing up.
rosettastone,3,0,shame because its been the best out of all the apes.
rosettastone,3,0,but it also costs clot more.
rosettastone,3,55,"the part where they teach you a new language is ok, like i did german but they just kept doing pictures and expected me to know what they were in german."
rosettastone,3,55,"and to get to session 3 you have to pay like, 30 dollars"
rosettastone,3,0,would have been a five rating if the mobile pp was included free for what i paid for pp version.
rosettastone,3,0,not keen to pay twice for same product.
rosettastone,3,0,so far it has been a very good pp and i can see it would help me with beginner's french if it wasn't for the fact it costs so much!
rosettastone,3,0,such a shame
rosettastone,3,1,ok pp.
rosettastone,3,1,needs improvement in voice recognition.
rosettastone,3,1,very expensive.
rosettastone,3,0,i like it but when i speak to the pp it never pick my voice up.
rosettastone,3,0,even with head phone in
rosettastone,3,3,the pp is incredibly inconsistent with capturing audit and the play button touch area is too small / inconsistent on elements where the containing element has a separate touch action
rosettastone,3,0,when i say the sentence or word it doesn't hear me.
rosettastone,3,0,this is a bad pp.
rosettastone,3,0,the mid doesn't hear me say the language
rosettastone,3,0,"it's pretty good, but kind expensive, i wish there were more free courses or cheaper courses other than that pretty good overall"
rosettastone,3,0,i think that it's a good pp for learning different languages but they don't really teach you how to have a conversation like how to say hi my name is so-and-so how are you
rosettastone,3,0,good program the only downfall is not knowing what your learning in spanish means exactly in english they have pictures and ways to help you understand and you get the general idea but it would be easier to comprehend and really take it all in if you knew exactly what you were speaking or learning just having the pictures and having them help you pronounce the words isn't enough it would be nice if they had english cautioned somewhere along with the spanish to get an even better understanding.
rosettastone,3,0,was offered a few introductory lessons free.if i had no basic spanish it would be difficult for me to match the conversation with the pictures as no english is used and words are not defined.
rosettastone,3,0,although roseola stone promised 3 days of use i could not get beyond first group of lessons.i have 3 other spanish programs download and rate each superior to roseola.
rosettastone,3,0,last week innovation ran an offer that was about half the cost of roseola and the presentation was more relaxed and effective.
rosettastone,3,0,installed
rosettastone,3,0,i love the pp i just wish you could set more then just one language i want at least 3-5
rosettastone,3,1,is a nice application witch is offering you the best experience and is well structures but because is expensive i will chose to learn more languages from couture tutorials.
rosettastone,3,1,thank you
rosettastone,3,0,very good approach.
rosettastone,3,0,but it is sad not to have the learning games in the pp.
rosettastone,3,0,a great start but you can't get far for free.
rosettastone,3,0,you have to pay for the full version.
rosettastone,3,20,i'm leaving a couple stars off strictly due to price.
rosettastone,3,20,roseola stone isn't even close to hitting that sweet spot where they would actually be making as much money off of their software as they could it's so expensive.
rosettastone,3,20,a course for one language isn't a far cry from what you'd pay at a budget university for a smelter of the same course.
rosettastone,3,20,"furthermore, i found that l lingo, while a little less usually appealing, has taught me faster."
rosettastone,3,20,"however, they are copying from roses program quite a bit."
rosettastone,3,0,"i like the concept of the pp but was dissatisfied and ended up meeting the pp when it did not have to, chichewa, rio or kuranko"
rosettastone,3,0,wish there were more games with these lessons to hold better attention with.
rosettastone,3,0,other than that good lessons.
rosettastone,3,1,very fun and easy.
rosettastone,3,1,i'm trying to learn japanese and this is the kind of practice i need.
rosettastone,3,1,cheers!
rosettastone,3,0,"really liked it at first, but after the second day, you have to pay for the pp."
rosettastone,3,7,this is a great pp that claims to be free but really isn't.
rosettastone,3,7,most of the lessons are locked.
rosettastone,3,3,"from a up standpoint, it would be great if all the extended learning activities do not cause the pp to lock into landscape mode."
rosettastone,3,0,goes a little slow.
rosettastone,3,0,doesn't let you advance to your current level.
rosettastone,3,0,great pp i already recognize some of the words in 2 weeks.
rosettastone,3,0,love it !
rosettastone,3,1,"i can't open webster from roseola stone, i don't understand what's wrong!"
rosettastone,3,0,not satisfied with the pp barely can understand the language.
rosettastone,3,2,"over rate, over prices, incomplete, has errors with no way to report them"
rosettastone,3,0,not happy about it.
rosettastone,3,0,pronunciation module is rubbish and it is annoying
rosettastone,3,0,great pp and lesson only its expensive in cost.its sad for the person no have money to paid the course its really good only for person have money.
rosettastone,3,0,i love it but i wish it did not cost so much.
rosettastone,3,0,i could just pirate it and get it for free.
rosettastone,3,1,not able to always get a response when i press.
rosettastone,3,0,it would help if it had a vocabulary section with direct translation of each word and verbs
rosettastone,3,0,if it was free pass the basis it would be better.
rosettastone,3,0,i wish there was some english once in a while to explain grammatical differences.
rosettastone,3,0,also stop asking me to rate the pp.
rosettastone,3,0,i have rate it 5 times already.
rosettastone,3,0,up to know no problem but it will be hard to member
rosettastone,3,0,lessons take too long
rosettastone,3,0,microphone freeze and does not take input.
rosettastone,3,0,great pp but if only you could change the language you want to learn
rosettastone,3,0,"dec 17, 2018 update broke ability for roseola stone/esch library solution to connect with pp."
rosettastone,3,0,why is it impossible for me to subscribe your e-mail offers?
rosettastone,3,0,i dont get it are you supposed to learn or buy all the lessons because in not doing that i dusted wanted to learn more spanish.
rosettastone,3,0,i hope i dont have to pay for everything.üò£
rosettastone,3,0,this pp helps in learning any language very easily.
rosettastone,3,0,not bad.
rosettastone,3,0,still think drops is best pp for learning language
rosettastone,3,1,"after downloading the pp i got a trial prompt, because i thought it was free trial i selected that option."
rosettastone,3,1,only to find out money has been taken out of my account.
rosettastone,3,1,can you help me with this?
rosettastone,3,1,"except in pp purchases, this pp is perfect!"
rosettastone,3,0,very nice but a lot of bags
rosettastone,3,30,i've issued a refund the same day i've purchased the subscription.
rosettastone,3,30,it want for me.
rosettastone,3,30,how long will it take for my refund?
rosettastone,3,0,i can log in on the web via my school webster but not the pp.
rosettastone,3,0,help me.
rosettastone,3,0,speech recognition needs work.
rosettastone,3,21,very disappointed to see the portuguese was brazilian portuguese and not european.
rosettastone,3,21,"if, and when european portuguese becomes available i will be happy to give it more stars."
rosettastone,3,21,already amended  the star rating because i like that  you responded.
rosettastone,3,21,:)
rosettastone,3,0,use too much time to download of unit.
rosettastone,3,0,i am learning spanish again.
rosettastone,3,0,"my texas accent is kissing me, however i am learning through visual and auditory measures."
rosettastone,3,0,is pp is good but is too costly they need to lower the price
rosettastone,3,1,so far i like it but i wish it also told me the translation of the word in learning in my language so in not confused from time to time
rosettastone,3,0,log in issues via andros
rosettastone,3,0,charge too much and so... bye for now.
rosettastone,3,0,very good pp.
rosettastone,3,0,easy to use.
rosettastone,3,0,"it's fine, but they don't have finnish, which i've heard is a beautiful language."
rosettastone,3,0,it's so so right now.
rosettastone,3,0,i'll be back later with an update
rosettastone,3,0,expensive.
rosettastone,3,0,but seems good.
rosettastone,3,0,seems like a really neat pp!
rosettastone,3,0,just wish it had scottish garlic and not just irish.
rosettastone,3,4,i think it's so expensive for some students(and me).
rosettastone,3,4,it's so good but i can't buy any packages of them by myself.
rosettastone,3,0,sure wish it would stop assuming me to rate it when i have multiple times
rosettastone,3,0,so far so good.
rosettastone,3,0,will be in a better position to rate better after using the pp for some time
rosettastone,3,0,just started!
rosettastone,3,0,hoping to keep learning!
rosettastone,3,0,give recently started and give already advanced in french.
rosettastone,3,3,i did not like it only because it would start me off with spanish but i have never read or learned spanish before.
rosettastone,3,0,just started so can't really rate it yet.
rosettastone,3,0,please add rude and angle (bengal) language as soon as possible.
rosettastone,3,0,hi its nice but am sad be i can continue ..i can buy the level üò¢i can ..

rosettastone,3,0,pretty good wish it had does with it
rosettastone,3,0,i feel like it doesn't give you a more understanding of connect words.
rosettastone,3,0,like (es=is) & (so= i am).
