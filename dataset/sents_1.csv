duolingo,1,10,hi there i'm leaving a review because i'm having a terrible time with this pp.
duolingo,1,10,"there is a forgetting issue that hides the correct choice behind the ""check"" button, and because you can't select the correct choice you can't pass the course."
duolingo,1,10,"this is happening in the organ language, alphabet 2, lesson 3. i tried to report a bug, and the catch purification keeps failing, so i can't even do that."
duolingo,1,10,"very disappointed, i thought this was a popular pp but it's clearly poorly maintained."
duolingo,1,1,this pp started out alright.
duolingo,1,1,it does an okay job of attempting to teach some basis of a language but it generally fails to explain how sentences or words in other languages work.
duolingo,1,1,"for example, in the hebrew language the letters in words go from left to right."
duolingo,1,1,domingo doesn't tell you this.
duolingo,1,1,i only knew this from other sources.
duolingo,1,1,and the pp also fails to properly tall up your points correctly and i ended up having to repeat over a dozen lessons for unknown reasons.
duolingo,1,1,look elsewhere.
duolingo,1,2,i'm using this pp to learn basic japanese.
duolingo,1,2,"the pp spends a lot if time trying to teach hiragana, but i'd much rather focus on building a basic speaking vocabulary so i can converse."
duolingo,1,2,reading is secondary.
duolingo,1,2,"also worth noting, japan has 3 alphabet, hirigana, katakana, and anti."
duolingo,1,2,domingo does not even attempt to teach anti (or katakana).
duolingo,1,2,truly the only reason i'm using this pp is it's free.
duolingo,1,5,"useless for japanese, throws things at you you cannot possibly know to use up your life points and has no way to directly practice the words and phrases you need to practice."
duolingo,1,5,practice mode pulls random subjects and practicing acid courses is also random.
duolingo,1,5,"it's all designed to get you to buy premium, and even then there are far better courses, apes, or webster that are far better."
duolingo,1,2,this was great pp until they ruined it with the life.
duolingo,1,2,everything used to function to keep you wanting to learn more and get better.
duolingo,1,2,now they've ruined all of that by forcing you to quit if you make a few mistakes.
duolingo,1,2,"it's evident all they care about is money now, they ruined a great pp for the sake of greed."
duolingo,1,0,worked ok before i created a profile.
duolingo,1,0,"now the pp won't let me change languages, won't load lessons, hasn't stored all my progress, and it claims i'm office when i am not."
duolingo,1,0,"i have tried clearing catches, starting the device, and uninstalling/reinstating several times."
duolingo,1,0,nothing works.
duolingo,1,4,unfortunately the long wait for the hearts to regenerate is not a good experience for beginners to a new language as they will make many errors they use up their lives quickly then have a five hour wait to try again the previous domingo was far better as you could make as many errors as you like and even experiment as some languages allow you to say the same thing but in multiple ways
duolingo,1,181,"seems great at first, until you get to more complicated parts."
duolingo,1,181,there's a complete lack of explanation as to why something is wrong.
duolingo,1,181,"yes, you can ask a question are read through other users explanation of what something is, but this is users helping other users and they're not always correct."
duolingo,1,181,"also, what exactly is the premium for if you're still radiant on users explaining (and therefore teaching) the language?"
duolingo,1,181,"basically, you run through the same set of questions, never fully understanding."
duolingo,1,6,purchased the plus subscription at the end of october 2019 for 6 months and paid front.
duolingo,1,6,today when doing a lesson the new year promotion popped up and after closing it my plus subscription is no longer active.
duolingo,1,6,i still have until the end of april but can't find a way to reinstate the plus features.
duolingo,1,6,tried reporting it through the help centre but that has a bug too and i'm unable to submit my request.
duolingo,1,6,please help!
duolingo,1,6,"the hind course is so itchy you have to hope you get the ""watching pairs"" question that isn't missed up just to continue the course lessons."
duolingo,1,6,it really slow progress.
duolingo,1,6,why would i want to keep coming back to lessons that you can never pass because the entire system is missed up?
duolingo,1,6,really disappointed.
duolingo,1,6,"was so excited for this, but came to a grinding halt at level 3. sent in feedback and a but fix report."
duolingo,1,6,nothing yet.
duolingo,1,6,what a shame.
duolingo,1,6,"this pp is so frustration, not because i lose all of my heart's on simple mistakes that the pp should recognise as types, it is because it beats you over the head with constantly trying to get you to become a member of the premium pp."
duolingo,1,6,"(the complain is actually about me losing all of my hearts in simple types that the pp recognizes sometimes, but other times it is being totally dumb about the whole situation)."
duolingo,1,1,i've been trying to use the pp the last couple of weeks and it laws so much now.
duolingo,1,1,"it used to work just fine, what happened!!???"
duolingo,1,1,üëé update (1/13/20): pp does not work at all anymore.
duolingo,1,1,i've attempted to use it the last 3 days and it seems stuck on a loop (starting and closing).
duolingo,1,1,‚òπ
duolingo,1,5,the pp definitely has some major bags.
duolingo,1,5,"i know it sounds childish, but if i have filled my hearts spending 350 gems and it doesn't get reflected, it is heartbreaking to me."
duolingo,1,5,"it's like paying online for a food delivery order, but the order is never noted, despite the amount being deduced from the account"
duolingo,1,27,i‚Äôve been using this pp for a long time and loving it.
duolingo,1,27,"but, it was always obvious that they are struggling with their promise to be ‚Äúalways free‚Äù in the face of market reality."
duolingo,1,27,"so, i‚Äôve seen them experimenting with different features that might get people to pay for premium."
duolingo,1,27,"well, they finally broke their promise as expected and introduced a ‚Äúhearts system‚Äù that limit the use of the pp unless you have premium account in which you could buy unlimited hearts."
duolingo,1,27,this is such a steady way of forcing people to pay for premium while still pretending you are free.
duolingo,1,27,if you cannot hold you promise then just don‚Äôt.
duolingo,1,27,tell the users it‚Äôs not working and some changes are needed.
duolingo,1,27,but why do you have to do it by limiting the amount of mistakes a person can make in the courses?!?!?
duolingo,1,27,"just limit the amount of courses a person can take a day or the amount of time for practice, or just close some features from the free users (like the tips or the ‚Äúskin a course‚Äù key)."
duolingo,1,27,limiting the errors i can make in a course?!?
duolingo,1,27,are you bidding me?!?!
duolingo,1,27,how does a person suppose to learn if not from making mistakes?!?
duolingo,1,27,"moreover, most of the mistakes are not even mine‚Äîa lot of the mistakes are the pp‚Äôs (i don‚Äôt know how many times i selected the ‚Äúmy answer should have been accepted‚Äù option and got an email from them saying i was right), and not to mention all the mistakes one makes because of the phone‚Äôs spell checked."
duolingo,1,27,just as principle i‚Äôm not going to be a premium member.
duolingo,1,27,"there is babel, drops, memories, and many other apes for learning languages."
duolingo,1,27,"all of them are not free, but at least they are being honest about it right from the start!!"
duolingo,1,27,!
duolingo,1,36,i was really disappointed with the update.
duolingo,1,36,now you have to waste all your hard worked lights to skin a level which doesn't make sense.
duolingo,1,36,i only skin levels once i'm confident i can do it so why is it that it's something only those who have plus can do it unlimited?
duolingo,1,36,if domingo's motto is to make learning languages free they should keep it that way for everybody.
duolingo,1,36,"i am fine with receiving as, i get that they need funding to keep running but giving plus more privileges becomes a 'pay to win' pp"
duolingo,1,106,i have had to drop my rating to a 1 star.
duolingo,1,106,"the pp is fantastic, i love learning with it."
duolingo,1,106,"however, there is something very wrong with the up system."
duolingo,1,106,"i earn mine honestly, but there are several people that use a hack to cheat."
duolingo,1,106,there is just no way that i can see how anyone can earn 700 up in 10 minutes.
duolingo,1,106,"i hope by making a 1 star review, the developer will take notice and close these loopholes."
duolingo,1,106,"allowing it to remain does not make me want to pay for the pp, and i am thankful it's still free."
duolingo,1,4,exceptional pp.
duolingo,1,4,but i'm having problems upbraiding to plus.
duolingo,1,4,i was hoping to take advantage of their 2020 deal.
duolingo,1,4,but all payment methods are being declined (even though all payment details are up to date and correct.)
duolingo,1,4,tried to submit a help request though the pp and even that's broken.
duolingo,1,4,"can't attach screenshots, which is mandatory."
duolingo,1,4,"and no catch image appears, thus rendering me unable to submit the form anyway."
duolingo,1,4,i really hope the developer see this and help me out.
duolingo,1,4,because i love this pp.
duolingo,1,16,"i chose japanese to learn, considerably one of the hardest languages."
duolingo,1,16,"being that i already had some experience working with a native teacher teaching me the language, i was a bit confused on how they were teaching people."
duolingo,1,16,"for one, you hardly learn any of the characters before jumping straight into learning words."
duolingo,1,16,"the harder part of the language is quickly introduced within the first lesson, even though it is typically learned after you learn the words in the easier characters."
duolingo,1,1,i think it's services are okay.
duolingo,1,1,"however i accidentally signed up for do-lingo plus, you get 1 week free plus and i thought sure."
duolingo,1,1,next thing i know i'm down 60 dollars for a subscription i did not want.
duolingo,1,1,"i could do the monthly fee, but to take out a whole year subscription i didn't want."
duolingo,1,1,do-lingo you are a con pp!
duolingo,1,41,domingo used to be a great place for me to learn spanish for several reasons.
duolingo,1,41,"it alternated from translating from english to spanish and vice versa, i was able to clock levels that were a little more interesting with lights (earned), and eventually i unlocked short fill in the blank dialogue."
duolingo,1,41,"most of this still applies, but it's ruined for me because the lingo system is replaced with the heart system, which means you're allowed to make only five mistakes unless you put down money."
duolingo,1,41,pus fix
duolingo,1,3,the pp was working fine until latest update.
duolingo,1,3,now my progress is not dating and continually stuck on the same lesson and up score also not dating.
duolingo,1,3,fix it before i install and stop using.
duolingo,1,3,oh and now its saying in office and not connected to the internet when i am.
duolingo,1,125,this pp was working out just fine until they recently changed all the rules ü§¨ no notice no explanation no nothing!
duolingo,1,125,now it is not fun anymore üòï why would they make it harder?
duolingo,1,125,"now you have these hearts, 5 of them and in a lesson when you make a mistake you loose a heart."
duolingo,1,125,after you make 5 mistakes you can't practice anymore!!!!
duolingo,1,125,what???
duolingo,1,125,"also i had plenty of gems to have fun ""buying"" stuff with...but now the same thing that cost 10 gems now cost 200!!!"
duolingo,1,125,now that's some serious inflation!!!
duolingo,1,125,ü§®üò©
duolingo,1,6,initially it was teaching sounds and how they looked written down.
duolingo,1,6,then some of the sounds were combined.
duolingo,1,6,"i assume as in english th is different to t, h, ch different to c and h. i was happy with my progress."
duolingo,1,6,suddenly it wants me to translate words and short sentences that i haven't seen before.
duolingo,1,6,which means i can only make random guesses as to the correct answer.
duolingo,1,6,"surprisingly, i'm getting a lot wrong!"
duolingo,1,6,but i'm only allowed a few incorrect answers before i'm locked out for several hours!
duolingo,1,1,this pp is trash.
duolingo,1,1,a few lessons in and it starts asking you to translate words it hasn't taught you yet.
duolingo,1,1,this means you have only a one in three chance of getting it right.
duolingo,1,1,make five mistakes and you can't continue... unless you pay for premium.
duolingo,1,1,isn't showing an ad after literally every lesson enough?
duolingo,1,4,i used this pp in the past and it was great.
duolingo,1,4,"i felt like my language skill were lacking, so jumped back on."
duolingo,1,4,but the heart system is shod!
duolingo,1,4,"it leaves you no time to actually make any mistakes, which at the end of the day is all part of learning, especially with new languages."
duolingo,1,4,please change
duolingo,1,12,since i can't get any answers i have to do a negative review.
duolingo,1,12,i am having issues with this pp and no way to find out why so i'm really annoyed.
duolingo,1,12,i have been buying the weekend amulet for months but for two weekend the amulet got used and in addition my streak freeze was used.
duolingo,1,12,so two days for the price of three?
duolingo,1,12,last weekend i bought the weekend amulet but went ahead and did lessons to prevent losing a streak freeze and the amulet was used even though i did lessons.
duolingo,1,12,why??
duolingo,1,12,that's just ridiculous.
duolingo,1,20,"the hearts system is really really bad, the person to learn something new he need to make mistakes because he is in the process of learning something new."
duolingo,1,20,the hearts system disrupt the learning process.
duolingo,1,20,the pp filled with as and i support you through the as system why i need to support through second system too?
duolingo,1,20,"i don't recommend this pp to anyone who wants to learn a new language, at least not anymore."
duolingo,1,498,great for being exposed to new words quickly but that's also it's biggest weakness.
duolingo,1,498,there is no feature that lets you review the words you've learned.
duolingo,1,498,also i don't understand why they downgraded the pp by adding a stupid heart system that stops you from learning if you make too many mistakes.
duolingo,1,498,making mistakes is how we learn the most.
duolingo,1,498,annoying people into paying for do+ whilst still being under the guise as an pp that offers free education?
duolingo,1,498,the english word for that is 'evil'
duolingo,1,15,it monitor you like a facebook pp.
duolingo,1,15,if you get things wrong it takes away 1 of your 5 hearts and when you are out of hearts you cannot continue until the hearts refill.
duolingo,1,15,instead of helping you it just treats it like a game.
duolingo,1,15,basically if you aren't perfect it is a waste of an pp.
duolingo,1,2,does not explain the rules behind articles in german.
duolingo,1,2,just expects you to know them instantly.
duolingo,1,2,on top of that the things you buy the the shop are broken and dont ever work even though they take your lights.
duolingo,1,2,leaderboards are broke as well.
duolingo,1,2,"just farm the same ""story"" over and over again to get x the up from a harder lesson."
duolingo,1,14,i use to give this pp five stars until the last update.
duolingo,1,14,the last update added hearts.
duolingo,1,14,this makes it difficult to practice my lessons.
duolingo,1,14,it takes forever for the hearts to come back.
duolingo,1,14,i am so disappointed.
duolingo,1,14,"this pp used to make learning a new language fun, but now it is really distressful because i know if i get something wrong i will not be able to continue."
duolingo,1,8,this pp helped me learning french.
duolingo,1,8,but it's really rubbish.
duolingo,1,8,"they want you to use the pp everyday, which i can accept."
duolingo,1,8,"but then they ll compel you to buy , lot of as , more than all after reaching diamond league they want you to reach #1 place which is impossible as some user use domingo plus."
duolingo,1,8,if not u should keep playing until u get #1 otherwise you will be devoted to the previous league.
duolingo,1,8,so keep playing until u die.
duolingo,1,8,such a non sense concept.
duolingo,1,8,i stopped playing bc of this pressure.
duolingo,1,8,f***
duolingo,1,1,i did basic learning for japanese.
duolingo,1,1,after two lessons it didn't save and restarted.
duolingo,1,1,took me back to basic learning or test placement.
duolingo,1,1,this happened 3 times.
duolingo,1,1,each time after i finished the first lesson.
duolingo,1,1,i don't know if this is a known bug.
duolingo,1,16,good and useful but still frustration when it gives you red for obvious fatfingering.
duolingo,1,16,"on languages with sound recognition exercises, it needs translations of the sound bits when they have meaning on their own."
duolingo,1,16,that would help memorizing the characters.
duolingo,1,3,i was enjoying this pp for two weeks.
duolingo,1,3,but all of sudden every sound on the pp gone.
duolingo,1,3,"i just can hear any thing anymore, i did every thing to solve it but it didn work."
duolingo,1,3,"every sound, every listening exercise is not unable now."
duolingo,1,3,it really disappointed me and interrupted my progression
duolingo,1,11,"its was ok but the way it's taught could be better and more clear and the voice chat to answer what the word is, is rigged and doesn't pick up the voice and even if i said the sentence right it tells me i got it wrong and now we can only learn for a limited time until we run out of hearts which is dumb and shouldn't be a thing!!"
duolingo,1,11,!üëéüëéüëé
duolingo,1,0,"great idea and was really enjoying it to begin with but, despite getting full marks on all lessons, it doesn't track progress and i keep getting asked to do the same levels over and over again"
duolingo,1,5,the hearts system is terrible and makes domingo a total waste of time.
duolingo,1,5,"it punishes you for making mistakes, which is totally senseless as mistakes are crucial to learning just about anything!"
duolingo,1,5,"additional, with or without hearts, most of the pp's sentences are not at all useful in real life."
duolingo,1,5,"it's much better learning the grammar of your target language with comprehensive textbook, reading books and listening to media in the language and expecting your vocabulary with drops and clozemaster."
duolingo,1,12,the pp has a pitch for hind language.
duolingo,1,12,"in level 3, it is impossible to select the correct character for to."
duolingo,1,12,you cannot select the correct answer.
duolingo,1,12,"you cannot do lesson 4 before completing lesson 3, so this is a huge issue."
duolingo,1,12,i will not try the paid version until this pitch is fixed.
duolingo,1,12,otherwise i love the style of learning.
duolingo,1,6,this pp isn't about learning anymore but a competition to stay in the league.
duolingo,1,6,i try to learn for hours daily but i still get devoted and it's so frustration.
duolingo,1,6,i end up doing stories to stay in the league instead of learning.
duolingo,1,6,it's frustration.
duolingo,1,6,i'll have to look for another pp that is strictly for learning and not competing with imaginary people
duolingo,1,112,used to love the pp but can't stand it now with the heart system.
duolingo,1,112,it makes me afraid to make a mistake as i will have to wait hours to try again.
duolingo,1,112,"you shouldn't be punished for failure in a learning pp, such an obvious money-grab drive to make people buy domingo plus."
duolingo,1,112,complete let down and i'll be using other apes now
duolingo,1,2,"terrible... using it to learn japanese is terrible, i would not recommend it for learning the japanese language."
duolingo,1,2,the learning structure they designed for japanese starts off well but then falls apart rapidly within the first few lessons.
duolingo,1,2,i do not recommend this pp for learning japanese... complete rubbish
duolingo,1,2,never make learning process a competition.
duolingo,1,2,one should learn slowly and with efficiency.
duolingo,1,2,competing in leagues and striving to secure place in top 10 has been one of the worst experiences.
duolingo,1,2,"and this new health system is breaking, people learn with mistakes and they should be let to do so."
duolingo,1,2,i agree that it is one of the best platforms to learn a language but that doesn't mean you impose so many unnecessary things.
duolingo,1,2,better domingo changes the way of health and the leagues.
duolingo,1,1,it is amazing if you are one of the lucky ones without hearts.
duolingo,1,1,"if you have hearts, you are kicked out of a lesson if you reach 0 (making mistakes is part of learning, except for this pp apparently)."
duolingo,1,1,completely ruined the learning experience.
duolingo,1,3,"despite completing daily lessons and receiving the screen notifying me that i have extended my streak, i wake up being notified that my streak freeze has been used up or streak has been broken."
duolingo,1,3,"ten dollars a month is steep for a sanctioning pp, let alone this one."
duolingo,1,1,its great for five minutes then you run out of 'credits' or whatever and you can learn any more without waiting or paying which makes it completely useless.
duolingo,1,1,don't bother.
duolingo,1,0,the pp is really bad.
duolingo,1,0,"5 hearts, takes 5 hours to regenerate one."
duolingo,1,0,one mistake loses an hearth.
duolingo,1,0,"do not use this pp, use the brother/mobile version instead."
duolingo,1,0,there you have unlimited lives.
duolingo,1,53,quit out of frustration.
duolingo,1,53,"pp has reallysuperfun ""trick"" questions to use up all your hearts, so you have to play lots practice as, i mean games, to do lessons."
duolingo,1,53,"in: ""what is your name?"""
duolingo,1,53,"in french the correct answer is seemingly random: ""duel est votre/ton nom"" ""comment tu t'appealed"" ""comment vous appealed-vous"" pick the wrong one, even though there all right, you still be trying to get past same question 65 times later!"
duolingo,1,53,"formal translations are rarely accepted: ""comment t'appealed-tu?"""
duolingo,1,53,wrong
duolingo,1,0,they make this like it's a game...taking hearts away when you get something wrong...not allowing you learn at a good they want you to pay to learn at your own pace...other i know with the pp thinks it's a joke that i have to wait for my heart to replenishedüòë
duolingo,1,0,make sure you cancel a subscription before it charges.
duolingo,1,0,"even if you haven't used the pp in months, you won't get a reminder or refund after the charge."
duolingo,1,0,while you are using it though it's good.
duolingo,1,1,the introduction of hearts dumps earners' lesson progress and locks them out after five mistakes.
duolingo,1,1,i previously gave this pp five stars but i have to update my rating as this recent update makes me start looking for competing products.
duolingo,1,1,it is idiotic.
duolingo,1,0,the problem now i have is that the sounds are not payable!
duolingo,1,0,i can't play the sounds.
duolingo,1,0,i press the button but nothing happens!
duolingo,1,0,i've checked my phone settings but everything was ok!
duolingo,1,6,they changed my lingo system to heart system just when i was getting into it.
duolingo,1,6,now there's no exercise button either.
duolingo,1,6,lost all my lights.
duolingo,1,6,lost my streak progress and streak freeze status.
duolingo,1,6,no reply from the develop as well when failed them about this.
duolingo,1,6,you talk a out prompting education and then use such predator practices to push your premium service.
duolingo,1,6,i'd much rather pay for a face to face tutor and who charges the same amount and is far more dynamically interactive.
duolingo,1,0,i loved the pp at first but i know my answer is correct and it keeps saying wrong and in getting annoyed and it is the same question over and over again that is getting me frustrated i reported it twice and still nothing i installed the pp and nothing works this pp is garage please fix it
duolingo,1,1,"when i signed up for the free trial, the going cost after the 7 day trial was stated as $12.99 per month, however i have just been charged an annual subscription fee of $134."
duolingo,1,1,this is dishonest marketing.
duolingo,1,0,unable.
duolingo,1,0,"during the watching game, you finish with two cards that don't match with no way to continue the lesson."
duolingo,1,0,the sound in the pp keeps disappearing and then returning after i click for it to speak the sentence to me a million times.
duolingo,1,0,"it is super annoying, and ruins the whole practise."
duolingo,1,0,please fix it.
duolingo,1,0,"my ""streak freeze"" has been saying ""equipped"" for a few weeks now so i can no longer utilize that function if i need to miss a day."
duolingo,1,0,please fix this.
duolingo,1,0,thanks.
duolingo,1,0,"it was very good at first, but now it does not play sounds and pronunciation an there is no support for this problem"
duolingo,1,0,unable.
duolingo,1,0,"towards the end of each lesson, there is a question with a fill in the blank."
duolingo,1,0,a tying box or multiple choice don't show up at all and causes me to have to exit the lesson completed.
duolingo,1,0,"after the recent update, the pronunciation of the words and and sentences are gone."
duolingo,1,0,i have to go on learning without sound and voice guide.
duolingo,1,0,"since last update, some of the lesson i do doesn't count in my up."
duolingo,1,0,it's like i didn't done them.
duolingo,1,0,i have to exit and launch the pp again and do one lesson at a time.
duolingo,1,0,when in learning japanese the page laws and i dont get like 80% of the work and dont understand what going on.
duolingo,1,0,the tips page which explains what i need to know laws and doesn let me access it so i still dont get what anything means.
duolingo,1,0,this pp is terrible for beginners.
duolingo,1,0,"i'm trying to learn vietnamese, and within the first few prompt is was already shooting full on vietnamese sentences to me about ferries wheels without any context or previous learning on ferries wheels."
duolingo,1,0,"i could see how it be good for brushing up on a language, but definitely not for learning one from start."
duolingo,1,0,"there's this really annoying pitch with domingo stories where once i complete a story and click continue, the up does not register and it the screen freeze."
duolingo,1,0,please fix this.
duolingo,1,0,"this pp would be helpful if it didn pitch out when i move blocks around during the ""what do you hear"" sections."
duolingo,1,0,will change review when fixed.
duolingo,1,0,the hearts are ridiculous.
duolingo,1,0,you loose hearts even if you make one mistake.
duolingo,1,0,like types.
duolingo,1,0,it doesn let you pick the place at which you learn.
duolingo,1,0,it pick it for you.
duolingo,1,0,it is super frustration and i personally wouldn recommend domingo to anybody for this reason.
duolingo,1,0,the pp others me several times per day and they send me multiple email per day to keep practicing.
duolingo,1,0,i don't need to be harassed multiple times per day & i certainly don't need to justify or explain myself for not continuing to practice.
duolingo,1,0,enough is enough.
duolingo,1,0,no tying in pp why of would you not consider making tying in the pp a thing?
duolingo,1,0,"it's way better than just guessing from like 10 words, tying trains your brain to think for itself."
duolingo,1,0,this is ridiculous.
duolingo,1,0,do is good but the pp just sucks because of this.
duolingo,1,0,i've used do lingo off and on for years.
duolingo,1,0,"it's fun at first, i did learn from it."
duolingo,1,0,"i've never quite finished a language program, but i've come within 5 lessons."
duolingo,1,0,"twice now i've come back to refresh what i know, and all of my progress is gone."
duolingo,1,0,they delete everything if you don't use the pp for a few months.
duolingo,1,0,"after the first time i almost didn't try it again, but i did."
duolingo,1,0,"the second time, i'm done."
duolingo,1,0,"fine enough for super beginners i guess, but not really."
duolingo,1,0,would not recommend.
duolingo,1,17,"great pp without hearts, but really sucks with them."
duolingo,1,17,i had about 150 days without the hearts (lives).
duolingo,1,17,then they showed up.
duolingo,1,17,you get five lives a day and then you lose one for every simple mistake.
duolingo,1,17,they justify the hearts by saying that you won't learn new material if you spend too much time on the pp.
duolingo,1,17,"this seems to be a flat out lie, because everything else is feared to making you want to spend more time learning, leagues, up's, etc."
duolingo,1,17,the paid version has unlimited lives = real reason.
duolingo,1,19,"i'd like to be able to delete the account matched with my email, or at least turn off the email modifications."
duolingo,1,19,"i've tried unsubscribing to the email, but still get them."
duolingo,1,19,"i've gone into both the desktop and pp settings to turn off the modifications, delete/disabled 'my' account, yet everything remains the same."
duolingo,1,19,"this is extremely annoying and a waste of time, but i can't disabled anything."
duolingo,1,19,i can't even switch it out to another email.
duolingo,1,19,i'll return to using domingo only if i can disabled this account
duolingo,1,0,"this pp is not optimized for andros tablet; it appears to have only portrait screen orientation, which is extremely uncomfortable."
duolingo,1,0,not unlike conventional learning methods.
duolingo,1,0,"repetition seems to be the key with this pp, and is lacking a true essence of understanding the language."
duolingo,1,0,a great way to practice another language.
duolingo,1,0,repetition and helpful tips with reminders.
duolingo,1,0,"canceled subscription, still recurring."
duolingo,1,0,hated the new hearts system.
duolingo,1,0,five mistakes then you're done.
duolingo,1,0,have to pay more to continue to use the pp.
duolingo,1,0,it is nice but the heart system is totally irritating as it stops you from learning if you make too many mistakes...pus sort out this problem.
duolingo,1,0,do not download this pp it a waste of time if you get 5 things wrong you have to wait all day to use the pp again or pay for their premium if your trying to learn a new language fast this pp is not the way all it's going to do is passing you off when you get 5 things wrong
duolingo,1,1,"disappointed, dont have my language üò•when i, go learning a language the other window open what is your language üò° there isn't my language then i'm stuck in this window, what is my language.come on guns at least put an option like others then the languages you guns list there please do add more languages or give a choice to choose an option like others or ..."
duolingo,1,0,it does not start the next heart counter till i open the pp and click on it!
duolingo,1,0,"now it gives me hearts full ratification, but shows 4 hearts only when i open."
duolingo,1,0,"on the leaderboard, this one guy has almost 8000 up in a day."
duolingo,1,0,is that even possible?
duolingo,1,0,"pp asks, what language do you speak but it's not showing rude neither i want to read text in rude , i prefer english text but i have to select environment from those languages which i can't even read .. why we must have to choose our language while we installed english version of pp there must be no restrictions on selecting language for environment as it can stay in english and user can learn any of your given language."
duolingo,1,5,a few years ago do was a fun way to learn.
duolingo,1,5,i even almost bought pro.
duolingo,1,5,after many updated its harder to use and pro is too much $.
duolingo,1,5,"learning a language is valuable, but there are many other free option."
duolingo,1,5,"update see '19: the health system is frustration & not helpful, and i'm trying out other apes."
duolingo,1,5,update run '19: the leaderboard is not as motivation as being in a group with people i knew.
duolingo,1,5,update jan '20: the overt homosexual agenda in all of the stories is tiresome and i can't take it much longer.
duolingo,1,1,domingo is getting worse with every update.
duolingo,1,1,i use to be a premium subscribe... st it is this stupid competition and points... not a productive way for learning!
duolingo,1,1,now domingo has a review of prior lessons every other day... this is a waste of my time!
duolingo,1,1,are you really having me review the first lesson of my entire domingo instruction?
duolingo,1,1,"it is random... so if i want to keep my lessons current, i must do your review choice, not mine?"
duolingo,1,1,"i am using other apes:drops, lingual, busy."
duolingo,1,1,domingo sucks!
duolingo,1,1,it took one day after rating for the domingo pp to be useless.
duolingo,1,1,"well there you go, one star, hope you are happy."
duolingo,1,1,"sorry, but if you decide to remove the part where grammar of a lesson is explained, that makes the whole pp useless."
duolingo,1,1,i cannot train a lesson of which i have no information about whatsoever by purely hoping that i'm right.
duolingo,1,1,stop being so shady and bring back the lightbulb or at least write an explanation about it in updated
duolingo,1,3,"i would rate better as i have a positive experience learning, but the hearts functionality added is forgiving especially for anyone with audit processing issues or disabilities, and an obvious play to persuade people to buy pro."
duolingo,1,3,"i understand do needs to make their money but it's a harsh curve for new earners who will make mistakes, or even just when learning new skill."
duolingo,1,3,failing within lessons should be motivation enough for earners to slow down.
duolingo,1,3,honestly scared of my version dating...
duolingo,1,5,"besides the heart system is completely ridiculous, they still dare to stole my diamonds."
duolingo,1,5,"i spend 350 diamonds to get a full refill of diamonds and for my surprise, i didn't get the refill."
duolingo,1,5,"honestly domingo, i am waiting for an answer, if not, i am uninstalling it sap."
duolingo,1,5,"you are not given a f. for make learning free, you just anna sell the pro package."
duolingo,1,5,what a shame
duolingo,1,0,these limited heart is suck especially when you are running out of money but need to learn another language.
duolingo,1,0,at th level is harder than any level and if using computer you have to do many lesson compared to using mobile apes.
duolingo,1,0,it is a great concept but many translations are terribly wrong!
duolingo,1,0,this is ridiculous fix your translations!
duolingo,1,6,"while doing match the correct hind word with english work , all the option were finished and 'get' was left with 'of‡•Å‡§Å‡§ö‡•Ç‡§Å' but they were not watching and i could not progress ."
duolingo,1,6,please correct this pitch.
duolingo,1,6,i do it everyday and lost my big streak because of this.
duolingo,1,6,i would rate it 5 stars if this mistake is corrected because i really like this pp.
duolingo,1,6,thank you .
duolingo,1,88,i would love it but they need to take off the lives/hearts when you get exercises wrong.
duolingo,1,88,you only get five mistakes and then you need to either pay for premium to keep going or hope you have enough up points to use them.
duolingo,1,88,that is wrong because the desktop version doesn't have that.
duolingo,1,88,"if you have time, do the desktop version than this because it really sucks that i have to stop learning just cause i made five mistakes."
duolingo,1,88,like i'm learning a new language so of course i'm going to make mistakes.
duolingo,1,59,with latest update they shortened the number of lessons per level.
duolingo,1,59,"while it makes it quicker to breeze through and collect crowns, you end up retaining far less of the content."
duolingo,1,59,"previous version, if you didn want to grind you could test out of a level."
duolingo,1,59,that was better because users could move on when ready.
duolingo,1,59,"now it is basically just a flash card game pp, not a true language course."
duolingo,1,59,i've canceled my subscription.
duolingo,1,9,it hurts to write this review.
duolingo,1,9,"i started studying japanese with domingo, and i must say i was pretty happy with my studies and planned on continuing them on the pp."
duolingo,1,9,"but then, my account was switched to a/b testing, which makes the pp into a premium pp."
duolingo,1,9,"it says it's free, but you have to pay to actually achieve something, which sucks, and there's no turning back for my account."
duolingo,1,9,you can goose what i mean.
duolingo,1,9,"i am not going to use this pp anymore, and i advise you against using it as well."
duolingo,1,16,the heart feature they have added is useless - if it is my goal to learn a language in 3 months and i'm limited to 10 mistakes a day i'm not going to get very far!
duolingo,1,16,"looks like people who have an old version of the pp don't have this problem too, which is even more frustration!"
duolingo,1,0,the pp was once great for learning .
duolingo,1,0,now it's a premium pp with a system that punishes you if you make a mistake and don't pony up the cash to correct it .
duolingo,1,0,y'all got greedy .
duolingo,1,60,i am content using the free portion of the pp and putting up with the as.
duolingo,1,60,"but now they have ""updated"" to this heart system."
duolingo,1,60,essentially you are allowed 4 mistakes (hearts).
duolingo,1,60,if after making 4 mistakes you don't purchase more hearts then the lesson you are on is canceled.
duolingo,1,60,isn't the intent to teach?
duolingo,1,60,guess it's time to move on to the next pp.
duolingo,1,8,was 5 stars but since update is 1. i'm currently on a 372 day streak.
duolingo,1,8,i used to click on as to support you and on occasion has also led to a purchase.
duolingo,1,8,sad to say i'll now be uninstalling this pp as the latest update forces you to lose hearts if you make a mistake.
duolingo,1,8,this will lead to paying for something i already see as for.
duolingo,1,8,a universal truth in life is humans learn through their mistakes.
duolingo,1,8,penalizing your mistake when trying to learn is just wrong.
duolingo,1,8,"sadly then, goodby domingo."
duolingo,1,8,you ruined it.
duolingo,1,45,"the pp is great... except for one major flaw: there are no grammar notes on anything other than french, spanish and german."
duolingo,1,45,"i am not learning any of these languages, and i recently discovered that there are grammar notes for every language on desktop."
duolingo,1,45,"it was simply mindblowing to me, after just guessing for so much time."
duolingo,1,45,"it should be as easy as copy and passing, yet here we are."
duolingo,1,45,"it's unacceptable, it's like trying to bake a cake without the instructions."
duolingo,1,22,"when it works, it's a great and fun pp."
duolingo,1,22,"however, the speaking exercises have not worked for me for weeks because the pp has stopped recognizing my microphone, and that's when i realized how outdated and responsive their customer support is."
duolingo,1,22,"all their support documentation is from 2015 and for the web version, and they reply to none of my email or sweets."
duolingo,1,22,"update your into, fix your bags, and get some real customer support."
duolingo,1,40,"i love this pp, but i can't give it more than one star when it doesn't work right on a samson phone."
duolingo,1,40,"i'm stuck in a low level of ""habits"" in french, because a ""fill-in-the-blank"" exercise has no words."
duolingo,1,40,"also, when you do an upgrade to the entire pp, please, be sure that it is thoroughly tested prior to release."
duolingo,1,40,"the pronunciation part included is great, but there is no audit so it is a guessing game that is almost useless."
duolingo,1,5,effectively useless if you don't want to pay.
duolingo,1,5,"the heart system in this pp only allows you to make 5 mistakes before before you're forced to either quit your lesson or refill your hearts with in game currency, or you can buy that premium version for unlimited hearts."
duolingo,1,5,"hearts do refill themselves, but take i believe about 5 hours per heart so good luck having a long learning session."
duolingo,1,5,"if you dont mind spending the money it's great, otherwise dont waste your time and use another pp."
duolingo,1,2,i love this pp and the this of providing free languages to the masses.
duolingo,1,2,"however, i hate the streaks and the leaderboard, i don't want to compete with others."
duolingo,1,2,i want to learn at my own pace.
duolingo,1,2,"i don understand why i can't turn these two ""features"" off."
duolingo,1,2,they're anxiety inducing and made me quit this pp.
duolingo,1,1,weekend amulet don't work.
duolingo,1,1,i equip them and then my streak freeze always is used anyway?
duolingo,1,1,this needs to be fixed since it would be completely unfair to wipe streaks over a pitch.
duolingo,1,1,"if i have to check it every day to make sure the amulet is working, what's the point in having one?"
duolingo,1,1,fix this!
duolingo,1,1,!
duolingo,1,12,"i love this pp, though was hacked pretty badly after making exceptional progress and can't get my money back for the plus account and haven't received a response after reporting it three times."
duolingo,1,12,they need a way to log out of all locations and two-factor authentication to fix these types of issues.
duolingo,1,12,"i had to disabled my account after two years of progress, start over after a 69-day streak, and lost everything."
duolingo,1,12,someone is still using my plus account for free while i start completely over w/as.
duolingo,1,12,:(
duolingo,1,14,update... did really love the pp.
duolingo,1,14,but the health system is counter productive to my learning pace and the premium subscription i tried for a week and had no problem earning gems.
duolingo,1,14,the health system just feels like a way to railroad people into the paid version... the leaderboard doesn't separate free pp users from premium so you cannot compete in the leaderboards at all as you are penalized with health.
duolingo,1,14,paid users are not.
duolingo,1,14,disappointed.
duolingo,1,14,loved the pp before.
duolingo,1,14,now i'm looking for an alternative
duolingo,1,165,"was great, but completely ruined by the last update."
duolingo,1,165,"i actually recommend this to friends and upgrade to plus, but have downgraded and will probably install it."
duolingo,1,165,"since the last update, it 'under' your progress on previous levels, even if you use it every day."
duolingo,1,165,it has literally undone a level immediately after i have done the progress on another one.
duolingo,1,165,i can't learn anything new because i am constantly having to go over old stuff.
duolingo,1,165,terrible!
duolingo,1,0,bad for learning to write japanese.
duolingo,1,0,"an integral part of japanese learning, but with the lessons random asking for anti or hiragana without ever telling you which to use, you are then forced to use the word banks if you don't want to loose hearts, instead of being able to try and write to better learn."
duolingo,1,0,it soured my learning fast.
duolingo,1,0,shame because that aside the pp is good.
duolingo,1,0,"but until that major problem is fixed, i'm keeping that review as is."
duolingo,1,0,hope this will reach domingo staff.
duolingo,1,25,"i used to really like this pp, but the most recent update is horrible."
duolingo,1,25,wish i could go back to the previous version.
duolingo,1,25,they took away the simple practice feature that let me keep trying everything i had learned from all lessons up to that point until i felt comfortable to move on.
duolingo,1,25,and only 5 lessons to move on?
duolingo,1,25,not near enough.
duolingo,1,25,bring back the old version or lose tons users...
duolingo,1,4,"please remove the hearts feature, it's just annoying and makes me want to quit."
duolingo,1,4,if there was another free pp without this feature i would have already installed duolinguo.
duolingo,1,4,sometimes i unintentionally press confirm and i lose all of my hearts and then i can't complete the lessons.
duolingo,1,4,or maybe due to a bug the pp doesn't register all the words that i select and there goes another heart.
duolingo,1,4,so frustration
duolingo,1,0,i have a serious complaint about this pp.
duolingo,1,0,in the welsh lessons they only offer the northern dialect.
duolingo,1,0,as a hunt (southerner) i find that very offensive.
duolingo,1,0,you need to offer both southern and northern dialect.
duolingo,1,621,the latest update made the office feature totally useless.
duolingo,1,621,you still have to connect to the internet to load the lesson.
duolingo,1,621,what's the point of the premium then?
duolingo,1,621,it's getting more and more useless every new update.
duolingo,1,621,often doesn't lynch properly.
duolingo,1,621,the tolerable to type doesn't make sense and doesn't depend on how close they are in the keyboard.
duolingo,1,621,"before adding new features, please fix the office feature first."
duolingo,1,621,i am running out of patience as it's been almost a month.
duolingo,1,2,"this isn't compatible with board, which is the keyboard on my smartphone."
duolingo,1,2,"the pp became unable, and i had to install."
duolingo,1,2,so i did install it.
duolingo,1,2,"i can tell that if only this were compatible with my keyboard, this would be an awesome pp."
duolingo,1,2,i am so console that i installed this.
duolingo,1,10,i am changing my rating again on this pp again.
duolingo,1,10,"it used to crash a lot, that has been fixed."
duolingo,1,10,now i have an pp telling me i don't know how to read and write languages that i grew up with.
duolingo,1,10,"if the people that designed this pp are so smart, i dare them to try and live one day on the streets of la speaking the spanish they say is spanish."
duolingo,1,10,zero.
duolingo,1,10,"so, i originally thought this was a great pp, and i even had rate it stars, but until i was at streak 19, about to make it 20, but on my first question, (a two choice question) so i made a note that the other one was definitely the answer."
duolingo,1,10,"so when i finally gotten to that question, i clicked the ""right"" answer, and i had 3 lives left."
duolingo,1,10,so i clicked the other one.
duolingo,1,10,"wrong one, keep in mind that there was only two option."
duolingo,1,10,"so i was confused, then i am at 2 les, 1, 0. domingo forcing to buy live."
duolingo,1,62,"i have been charged as a premium member, something i didn't sign up for."
duolingo,1,62,when trying to reach domingo to fix the situation i have had no luck.
duolingo,1,62,i could find no way to get in touch with them.
duolingo,1,62,"after multiple tries, i did reach goose, as the charge went through a goose account."
duolingo,1,62,they were unable to help me either even though i reached out prior to the finalization of the bank transaction.
duolingo,1,62,i am very unhappy.
duolingo,1,62,this is completely unacceptable and the worst customer service i've encountered.
duolingo,1,22,loved using domingo on the phone.
duolingo,1,22,"stories were so fun and a great way to practice what i'm learning, i got pretty far and did a lot of them."
duolingo,1,22,but twitching to andros i've noticed a huge decline in quality on the pp.
duolingo,1,22,"definitely not as many features i enjoyed using daily, and it runs no where near as smooth."
duolingo,1,22,"i hope to see an improvement in quality soon because i truly enjoy using domingo, i use it daily and have recommended it highly in the past but not so much now.."
duolingo,1,7,the old version was better.
duolingo,1,7,it forces me to learn things i dont want to.
duolingo,1,7,earlier i could choose what i wanted to learn at my own pace.
duolingo,1,7,"for what i'm trying to learn, i dont want to learn symbols or letters, i dont want to read, but it forces me to learn it anyway."
duolingo,1,7,"i'm not happy, and its not fun anymore."
duolingo,1,7,the hearts only throw salt on the wound.
duolingo,1,7,"also, my account is lost."
duolingo,1,7,"i had clot of progress, but it says my account doesn't exist."
duolingo,1,7,"i want to go back to learning phrases, not the alphabet."
duolingo,1,45,i've used this pp for over a year and a half.
duolingo,1,45,"the recent update has changed several things i'm unhappy about, and i'm about ready to delete it."
duolingo,1,45,many people are visual earners.
duolingo,1,45,why take this away when going back to prior lessons to get a refreshed on words?
duolingo,1,45,"also, the lack of help is awful in the pp."
duolingo,1,45,"no explanations, just hints on how languages work."
duolingo,1,45,i also tried domingo plus and it's not worth the money.
duolingo,1,45,the new hearts addition is basically negative reinforcement.
duolingo,1,45,i no longer like this pp.
duolingo,1,61,as are suppose to keep it free.
duolingo,1,61,now it's heart related.
duolingo,1,61,use a heart to learn a section.
duolingo,1,61,mess up too often and you cannot learn anymore (and it is still ad supported).
duolingo,1,61,"however, if you pay for premium you can have unlimited hearts."
duolingo,1,61,took away lights of which i had 1300+.
duolingo,1,61,"my kiss use this in school for learning french, now they will not be able too."
duolingo,1,61,losing hearts for making mistakes while learning defeats the purpose of this pp.
duolingo,1,61,this update renders the pp painless.
duolingo,1,42,i used to love this pp.
duolingo,1,42,"while searching on how to learn a language, i learned that intensity is the most effective practice method."
duolingo,1,42,"now, before this update, i could do that."
duolingo,1,42,i could go hours picking up this knowledge and being able to hold it in.
duolingo,1,42,"however, after the recent update with this awful heart system, i can no longer continue with my usual method of learning."
duolingo,1,42,"not only that, it punishes students for making mistakes."
duolingo,1,42,"mistakes are going to be made, duhhhh!"
duolingo,1,42,so why make this update?
duolingo,1,0,1 star due to the marking system.
duolingo,1,0,"in the garlic course i often get marked ""correct"" when i have made an accent error, without the ""minor mistake"" tip telling me so."
duolingo,1,0,pp needs to always show this tip and treat accepted characters as separate from unaccented ones!
duolingo,1,0,otherwise it just reinforced poor spelling.
duolingo,1,0,"would be 5 stars otherwise, good pp."
duolingo,1,0,the practice buttons are a great feature.
duolingo,1,0,"as are not super intrusion, and overall the pp is very lightweight and easy to navigable."
duolingo,1,102,waste of time.
duolingo,1,102,i expected that to be one language but it's misleading.
duolingo,1,102,"it says ""which language do you want to learn?"""
duolingo,1,102,you select that which has an american flag next to it and that writing.
duolingo,1,102,"it comes up with a message saying ""the interface will be changed to that, you should only select this if you already know how to speak that""... so to learn that, you must already know it... right ok."
duolingo,1,4,i got on today and started a new lesson.
duolingo,1,4,i find out they have a new system.
duolingo,1,4,hearts.
duolingo,1,4,i think it is terrible.
duolingo,1,4,it will also drive away people who download the pp.
duolingo,1,4,you know why and i don't have to explain.
duolingo,1,4,i also think it is terrible because sometimes domingo is wrong with the translations.
duolingo,1,4,"i found out in norwegian that unnskyld means excuse, not sorry."
duolingo,1,4,what if i put that instead?
duolingo,1,4,do i lose my heart because your wrong and i'm right?
duolingo,1,4,"and another thing, i don't want to buy your stuff."
duolingo,1,0,the only thing good about this pp is it's free.
duolingo,1,0,"but you can buy ad free, but don't waste your money or time."
duolingo,1,0,levels and hearts are good for nothing.
duolingo,1,0,"if don't use do's translation they punish you, a good translator could do as well."
duolingo,1,25,"totally useless ""learning tool"" now."
duolingo,1,25,"they changed it to where you have no choice but to pay if you want to learn, but still have the audacity to give you as saying ""help us keep learning free."""
duolingo,1,25,the old domingo was way better and actually helped people who couldn afford to learn.
duolingo,1,25,i recommend finding a different language pp.
duolingo,1,25,you won't get fat in this one anymore.
duolingo,1,25,you'll run straight into a pay wall.
duolingo,1,0,"it doesn't work properly, the screen freeze after i give a correct answer to the question asked."
duolingo,1,58,"the arabic text is always too small, have to quiet when reading it even though i don't use glasses."
duolingo,1,58,it doesn't even have an option to adjust text size which would be so easy to implement.
duolingo,1,58,it's also hasn't limited lessons on it which basically just keep repeating random words and sounds throughout and doesn't really focus on grammar.
duolingo,1,58,huge dissatisfaction.
duolingo,1,95,"i just canceled my plus subscription because they have made too many changes in favor of ratification over education, and domingo is simply no longer effective for me."
duolingo,1,95,the latest update that dramatically reduced the number of lessons in each skill was the last straw.
duolingo,1,95,"it used to be that there were about 25 lessons to get from level 4 to 5, now there's only 20 altogether from level 1 to 5!"
duolingo,1,95,"i need more repetition than i'm getting now, there just aren't enough lessons for me to actually learn a skill before i've already mixed it out."
duolingo,1,8,can be a great learning tool but unfortunately none of the listening exercises work.
duolingo,1,8,i've tried working through all the troubleshooting processes and even uninstalling this pp and reinstating but they still don't work.
duolingo,1,8,i'm not sure how your supposed to learn a language if you can't listen to how words are pronounced.
duolingo,1,8,edit: audit is still not working.
duolingo,1,8,edit: audit still isn't working.
duolingo,1,8,very frustration!!!
duolingo,1,8,edit: still not working.
duolingo,1,2,"hey , if you are learning any asia language for example organ , hind etc."
duolingo,1,2,than this pp isn the one you should use!~ its worst for learning organ!
duolingo,1,2,"actually , the words don't sound like its written."
duolingo,1,2,and it had the worst start i guess!
duolingo,1,2,first level (basis) should be angel i guess :| (mio) .
duolingo,1,2,"either way , i learned angel from internet , but i got instantly confused when i learnt the same on do pp!"
duolingo,1,2,"sorry to say , but its the worst pp to learn organ."
duolingo,1,2,really good for french/spanish etc the!~
duolingo,1,2,"you guns started this competition with different level leagues, with the top 3 point finished receiving extra points."
duolingo,1,2,what did you think would happen?
duolingo,1,2,people are going to do the lesson they can finish fast to accumulate points to win.
duolingo,1,2,"now, you limit the amount of times a lesson can be done in a day."
duolingo,1,2,total is!
duolingo,1,2,"have leagues to win or teach languages, having both don't mix."
duolingo,1,5,it was easily 5 stars until today.
duolingo,1,5,"for those serious about learning a language, it's a great tool to keep you engaged daily."
duolingo,1,5,so why the poor review?
duolingo,1,5,"as you complete lessons and practice them, you get crowns."
duolingo,1,5,these take a lot of effort and time to acquire.
duolingo,1,5,"however, with an update to the language today, several of these crowns got wiped out back to zero."
duolingo,1,5,"weeks of work, gone."
duolingo,1,5,"it's a recurring problem with users losing progress, it's very decentivizing."
duolingo,1,5,really dumb from domingo and i don't get it.
duolingo,1,28,"i've been using domingo for a while (2055 days), i want to tell you that your changes are annoying."
duolingo,1,28,"i cannot complete some lessons because the words are not there, especially the ones with those hideous pictures."
duolingo,1,28,you cannot get more points from the stories.
duolingo,1,28,why you did that without any explanation?
duolingo,1,28,i am really disappointed.
duolingo,1,28,p.s.
duolingo,1,28,i hate the league thing.
duolingo,1,28,"it has no purpose, people competing for what?"
duolingo,1,28,and why you get those lights if there is nothing to buy anywhere.
duolingo,1,0,this pp is excellent.
duolingo,1,0,a great way to learn a new language.
duolingo,1,0,"however, after trying the free trial, my account was charged $90.18."
duolingo,1,0,"which i did not agree to!üò°üò°üò° i've been trying to get hold of someone to fix the problem, but i can't find any useful contact information."
duolingo,1,7,could be great.
duolingo,1,7,started learning makarin independently and download this to help top up my studies.
duolingo,1,7,"i can't get through a single set of questions as the ""what is this sound"" questions don't play a sound unless i leave the pp open for about 20 mind, then my phone will surprise me with some makarin, i wish these problems would have occurred before i played for the ""pro"" and wasted my money."
duolingo,1,7,(this didn't happen in the first few lessons.)
duolingo,1,0,i feel absolutely tricked into paying for this pp.
duolingo,1,0,you do the basis.
duolingo,1,0,"endless repeating words like taxi, stop, american, banana and other obvious stuff."
duolingo,1,0,then during test you're required to suddenly type perfect grammatical correct spanish.
duolingo,1,0,with many new words.
duolingo,1,0,"listen, with understanding, to entire dialogue."
duolingo,1,0,i also tried russian.
duolingo,1,0,"lesson one alphabet, obvious i thought."
duolingo,1,0,but no abc entire words.
duolingo,1,0,dont get this pp it's a con!
duolingo,1,2,limited lives concept is a deal breakers.
duolingo,1,2,"download and delete in the same evening, i'm not wasting my time."
duolingo,1,2,"if it was half an hour regeneration time like most games, i'd have less of an issue, but it's about 5 hours per life."
duolingo,1,2,i'd rather pay an actual person to teach me
duolingo,1,36,fix your goddamn pp!!!
duolingo,1,36,"this pp has a tons of stitches and when you go to report it, even the catch fails."
duolingo,1,36,"the quantity of exercises to qualify for next level changed random from 6 to 30. also, i've had full levels completed random without my doing."
duolingo,1,36,"plus, it is no longer warding lights for each completed exercise."
duolingo,1,36,another issue is the non-aggregate target as that violate your privacy.
duolingo,1,36,some for credit card companies with a dubious reputation.
duolingo,1,36,creep and illegal.
duolingo,1,13,absolutely rubbish having a completely different system (pp) depending on whether you download from is or andros.
duolingo,1,13,lights (is) gems & lives (andros) if i lose my lives & don't have enough gems to buy more i have to wait over 4 hours for new life or complete a practice session.
duolingo,1,13,if i'm on the last question of 15 & get it wrong so loose a life & if i can't buy another life i loose the whole session.
duolingo,1,13,it's very demoralising & frankly makes me want to give up.
duolingo,1,13,this doesn't happen with is.
duolingo,1,5,"terrible for actually learning a language with a huge amount of errors, which repeats and build bad habits."
duolingo,1,5,i use it as a glorified vocal flashcard program.
duolingo,1,5,"it can be something to supplement your language learning, but dont use it as a primary learning source."
duolingo,1,5,also pretty spasms with as.
duolingo,1,5,many other smaller issues that are too various to list if this pp really wants to be judged as a language learning tool and not just a flashcard pp as mentioned.
duolingo,1,1,"i'm one of the fortune to have the lights option for the ab testing, so i've been able to make quite good progress, however my partner has the hearts and rates it, and i can see why, as he barely gets practice due to this dumb hearts option."
duolingo,1,1,if someone is brand new to a language it is ridiculous to limit them to five mistakes.
duolingo,1,1,"5 mistakes per day, and if you lose them all in the first lesson you can't even maintain a streak."
duolingo,1,1,very discouraging.
duolingo,1,6,not unable long term.
duolingo,1,6,"they created a dumb*c feature that mass decays the hard earned progress points you benchmarked (esp without any means to immediately mass restore/prove/bump non-repression) just for what seemingly feels like trying for a tack cheap, lowlife sake of wanting to compel more pp screen time usage."
duolingo,1,6,"boring pp that laws and delegates to non use, sitting there making half of its ex-inspired monolingual american users feel again sociolinguistically apathetic, accomplished."
duolingo,1,32,"love the pp, (learning german) it sucks the fact that now hearts exist, cause it forces you to buy the plus version which is almost 60 bucks a year and i can't spend money on the before it wasn't like this and its clearly a downgraded version."
duolingo,1,32,and it takes 4 hours to get a new heart and even if i wait 4 hours it doesn't come so in stuck to practicing every 20 minutes.
duolingo,1,32,also i have invited 3 people and i haven't even got 7 days of premium.m
duolingo,1,5,"it is a useful tool in the process of learning a language, but will do you no good to use it by itself."
duolingo,1,5,"it offers practice, only practice for information you have previously learned."
duolingo,1,5,"you must take a class or have a book, because it will not teach phonetics."
duolingo,1,5,"if you do not know the phonetics of the level you are learning, you will get everything wrong."
duolingo,1,131,so i got the pp for 59.99 a year ago.
duolingo,1,131,"now, they say the pp is 60% cheaper."
duolingo,1,131,"unfortunately, the discount is only $0.11 as 4.99x12 is $59.88."
duolingo,1,131,i dont really see where's the discount here.
duolingo,1,131,"also, just noticed that the pp is super baggy now that i dont pay to use the pp."
duolingo,1,131,languages load up is really slow and strolling through lessons is unbearable slow and painful.
duolingo,1,131,i will avoid this pp at all costs.
duolingo,1,131,"dont bother paying, there are better apes out there."
duolingo,1,1,this pp is useless now.
duolingo,1,1,especially with makarin.
duolingo,1,1,it just throws random characters at you and you have to figure out what they are and how they are used.
duolingo,1,1,the things you have to learn are not useful and therefore are terrible to learn when you're just starting.
duolingo,1,97,the health system makes me not enjoy the pp!
duolingo,1,97,so frustration.
duolingo,1,97,i want to use the pp but i get kicked out when i make mistakes which is a part of the learning process.
duolingo,1,97,annoying thing is that my partner has the same pp and he didn't the version with the health!
duolingo,1,97,i get it is to get me to pay for the pp but you already run plenty of adds!
duolingo,1,97,don't ruin a good thing.
duolingo,1,97,not everyone can afford to pay for exclusive peaks.
duolingo,1,9,"i love this pp, but it absolutely refuses to let me log into my old account."
duolingo,1,9,"no matter how many times i install and install it, it freeze after i put my details in the sign in page and says there is an error in the connection."
duolingo,1,9,"really disappointed, and i have a lot of progress saved up that i now can't access."
duolingo,1,4,i got this pp.
duolingo,1,4,to brush up on my latin.
duolingo,1,4,at first it was good but the audit portions are muffled and with egg making it difficult to discern the speech.
duolingo,1,4,"also when it asks me to type the latin i hear, when i do it says i am tying in english."
duolingo,1,4,poor quality control.
duolingo,1,4,"i would have kept it, but it is reliable and has many defects."
duolingo,1,4,it is not an pp.
duolingo,1,4,to be trusted.
duolingo,1,4,installed.
duolingo,1,11,the number of lessons per level just got reduced for me to under 5 even for the high levels.
duolingo,1,11,you can't learn a language with so little lessons.
duolingo,1,11,"it was great before that - i could feel i am learning the language, but not any more."
duolingo,1,11,i hope they revert this change otherwise i will have to look for another pp.
duolingo,1,4,"#now not working at all# progressive, entertaining."
duolingo,1,4,seems effective.
duolingo,1,4,helped get over initial bundles in learning arabic.... but.. the pp is really itchy.
duolingo,1,4,says its office even when i'm online.
duolingo,1,4,consequently spend as much time trying to catch the wretched pp in the brief windows it's actually online as using it.
duolingo,1,4,now does no more than one lesson before reverting to office.
duolingo,1,4,utterly infuriating totally gates it's effectiveness.
duolingo,1,4,fix it and i'll buy premium.
duolingo,1,4,no explanation of grammar.
duolingo,1,31,i've been a loyal user for about 5 years now and had no complaints until very recently.
duolingo,1,31,do has a new feature that exists solely to frustrate and dishearten earners.
duolingo,1,31,"after devoting a lot of time and energy into completing a lesson, do will now arbitrarily pick completed lessons to rob users of and then demand that the they red what they've already done in order to ""restore"" the accomplishment that do has arbitrarily stolen."
duolingo,1,31,it's infuriating.
duolingo,1,12,don't get this pp.
duolingo,1,12,"terrible, the only thing it helps with is getting you confused."
duolingo,1,12,the pp was bad and every time i try something like a new lesson this screen would pop up telling me to create an account and i already have one.
duolingo,1,12,"so i just press ""sign in"" and try to sign in another pop-up comes saying ""account successfully updated"" and then i tap the lesson again but i have to go through the same process."
duolingo,1,12,terribleüò°üò†üò°üò†üò°üò†üò°üò†
duolingo,1,2,"since the introduction of the heart system, the pp isn't unable anymore."
duolingo,1,2,"they introduced it, so that people would buy domingo plus."
duolingo,1,2,pathetic.
duolingo,1,23,"i used domingo before and had a great experience with it but now there is some kind of hearts/health feature that does nothing more than hinder learning and ask you to ""please give us money"" like i don't mind sitting through as this just kind of ruins the pp."
duolingo,1,23,"its just another money sink, not worth it"
duolingo,1,0,this pp is not good for learning.
duolingo,1,0,they only allow 5 mistakes per day and throw in random words you've not learned yet and expect you to guess and get it correctly.
duolingo,1,0,"i would highly recommend all to delete this pp and download drop, a far better language pp."
duolingo,1,1,i thought using this pp was very great to learn a new language without paying but since the new heart function was introduced learning with domingo sucks.
duolingo,1,1,"i'm so disappointed, domingo isn't worth it anymore please look out for an other pp like babel"
duolingo,1,8,"very disappointed with this pp, just updated it and the life system is still a scar to get people to purchase premium as the lives take a good few hours to even get 1 life back, take this as a warning if you download."
duolingo,1,8,"just glad i used a notebook to write down clot of stuff so i can continue to learn without the pp now, might even save my friends the trouble by passing the material along."
duolingo,1,8,"as you say 34 his the same as a smelter, what about if you loose your lives in one hour, no learning here"
duolingo,1,17,i don't know if this is due to the new updated but i'm not able to choose the right answers when learning arabic because 1 or 2 answers are always getting cut off the screen and i can't stroll up/down to see them.
duolingo,1,17,also after a while the pp gets boring because it doesn't continue to teach you more difficult words & sentences.
duolingo,1,17,"the highest level is like, 5. can you add more arabic lessons please?"
duolingo,1,11,edit: going down another star.
duolingo,1,11,"installed to try again, accidentally clicked new user instead of log in and i had to install and reinstate the pp again because it wouldn't let me exit that new user screen even after closing + reopening the pp multiple times."
duolingo,1,11,it even had a back arrow but it didn't work.
duolingo,1,11,due to that frustration experience along with the previous one i have a bad taste in my mouth with domingo.
duolingo,1,0,"phenomena language learning tool in general... but the big problem with this pp is the hints are pretty critical to read so you get some structure behind the language you're learning, which is only available via the webster."
duolingo,1,0,"because the webster ounces me over to the pp, i've had to remove the pp from my phone."
duolingo,1,19,the use of hearts is completely demotivating and entirely destructive to learning a new language.
duolingo,1,19,"this makes the pp feel very inviting, especially when you're trying diligently to grow."
duolingo,1,19,"not only that, but it flaws if you do as much as make a slight type - troops, there goes your last heart, now pay for a subscription practice random phrases you haven learned yet to gain one meanly heart."
duolingo,1,19,dissatisfied and disappointing.
duolingo,1,3,generally a good experience but one major issue.
duolingo,1,3,i am a premium subscribe.
duolingo,1,3,"when i tried to submit a bug report they have a ""catch"" on their report form."
duolingo,1,3,"it is misconfigured, so there is no catch actually present and nowhere to enter a catch response."
duolingo,1,3,this makes it impossible for someone paying for the pp to resolve issues.
duolingo,1,0,i love this pp but this pp is not made for all people.
duolingo,1,0,lacks dyslexic support.
duolingo,1,0,spelling causes issues cause more missed questions than anything else.
duolingo,1,0,i suggest open dyslexic font haired with a spell check or the implementation of far more variation in correct answers that are miss spelled.
duolingo,1,0,--- in response to a spell check giving away answers.
duolingo,1,0,anyone who has taken a test by will find that this pp gives away answer.
duolingo,1,0,that sat rep class still paying off.
duolingo,1,0,1/5 spelling ruins this pp for me.
duolingo,1,31,"""health"" (whatever that is) runs out every time you make a tiniest mistake."
duolingo,1,31,"i failed to type the final ""m"" in ""mon"" at the end of a (somewhat lengthy) sentence, and it immediately erased a portion of my health find a better way to handle free users, or i'll find another way to practise my foreign language skill...."
duolingo,1,5,loved this pp for so long.
duolingo,1,5,helped me learn a language very quickly and it still helps me advance.
duolingo,1,5,"i would have given this pp 5 stars if not for the most recent update i received which only allowed me to make 5 mistakes before i was unable to continue the lesson without buying more ""hearts."""
duolingo,1,5,this makes learning very uncomfortable for me and seems like just a poor way to monetize the pp.
duolingo,1,27,i dont like how it was changed to the 3 hearts and blue gems.
duolingo,1,27,"it penalized you for getting stuff wrong which makes learning a new language even more frustration, and if you get three things wrong, it stops the lesson for you."
duolingo,1,27,how are you supposed to learn if you aren't allowed to make mistakes?
duolingo,1,7,do not absolutely do not get this pp.
duolingo,1,7,the lessons are not thorough at all and the system is super buggy.
duolingo,1,7,"i did the free trial and tried to cancel because of how disappointed i was overall with the pp, but i was still charged 83 dollars to my account and i have yet to get that money back."
duolingo,1,7,stay away.
duolingo,1,1,the recent addition of the various characters is incredibly distracting.
duolingo,1,1,is there not a way to shut off this feature?
duolingo,1,0,the heart are very hard to get.
duolingo,1,0,its too expensive to refill but also its too slow to refill.
duolingo,1,0,take more than 4 hours to fill 1 heart.
duolingo,1,0,please improve this system.
duolingo,1,0,best regards from me
duolingo,1,0,great pp for languages.
duolingo,1,0,"but, i paid for plus to download office content to use on the train."
duolingo,1,0,very disappointed that it cannot have sound without internet.
duolingo,1,0,even the content still need constant internet connection to be able to continue.
duolingo,1,0,not fun when you are on the underground :(
duolingo,1,2,i download it for the arabic course after they finally released it.
duolingo,1,2,i thought it would be a proper arabic course considering the time they took but it was the worst arabic course i've ever seen.
duolingo,1,2,even worse than the trial version of the paid apes.
duolingo,1,2,even they offer more content in their trial versions.
duolingo,1,2,and customer service is the worst.
duolingo,1,2,they dont email you back.
duolingo,1,2,and i'm not a free leader.
duolingo,1,2,i support the pp just because they offer free education.
duolingo,1,2,but lately they've kind of lost their way.
duolingo,1,2,improve!
duolingo,1,7,"the language lists are not in alphabetical order which makes finding a language tricky, then the actual teaching doesn't help because they just say words so fast you can't really catch the proper pronunciation."
duolingo,1,7,"to properly learn a language you need to be shown how to get your tongue around the words, not just butcher the spelling into your own language."
duolingo,1,23,the pp suffers from over use of american english.
duolingo,1,23,"on the french course many french words are shared in english, but the pp does not recognise this and forces american english."
duolingo,1,23,"for example 'cinema' is valid in both french and english, but to progress requires the use of an americans 'movie theatre'."
duolingo,1,23,"another example is 'biscuit', where the pp requires 'cook'."
duolingo,1,23,"in english a cook is a different form of confectioner from biscuit, and where confused can lead to real difficulties."
duolingo,1,4,domingo... you suck.
duolingo,1,4,i've been using this pp almost every day for years but every new update makes the learning experience worse.
duolingo,1,4,as are increasing but that's not the worst part.
duolingo,1,4,"functionality stitches, leagues, and incentive for learning keep dropping."
duolingo,1,4,"if there was a better learning pp in my language that was free, i'd give the bird the bird."
duolingo,1,13,plus is deceptive.
duolingo,1,13,domingo plus is advertised as days free and then 6.99 a month.
duolingo,1,13,got plus and was charged 88.61 for a year.
duolingo,1,13,"this is deceptive and i have tried to get a refund and have called goose, who told me to email the developer."
duolingo,1,13,"i did and was haven't gotten a response, it's been over a week."
duolingo,1,13,"called goose again, they said they were going to contact the developer to make sure they contracted me."
duolingo,1,13,still no response.
duolingo,1,13,"do not buy plus, its deceptive."
duolingo,1,13,still trying to get my money back.
duolingo,1,111,i got error message every time i finish a lesson.
duolingo,1,111,very frustration.
duolingo,1,111,"oh and 1 more thing, about the league race."
duolingo,1,111,"i find it strange because 1 person can in 1 hour or less accumulate more than 1000 up points, which in my estimation & experience is rather impossible to do."
duolingo,1,111,"i have tried so many times and even with the free 30 minutes up boost, one can only accumulate about 300 up points max."
duolingo,1,111,i don't know what it is but i sense something is not right.
duolingo,1,111,will domingo investigate or not?
duolingo,1,2,domingo has tricked me into paying again for the subscription by saying i lost my 397 day streak when i didn't as i had streak freeze bought.
duolingo,1,2,it has something to do with checking the pp right after midnight.
duolingo,1,2,"now i played 10$ for the subscription, had to cancel the securing payments, checked the pp, got back my streak, but the monthly streak repair (the reason i bought the subscription) wasn't used up."
duolingo,1,2,meaning domingo lied to me into paying.
duolingo,1,2,this is the last time.
duolingo,1,2,i want my money back.
duolingo,1,1,"revert to previous version, please."
duolingo,1,1,"the update by 12 dec 2019 introduced distracting graphics, counterproductive to focused learning and using space on screen, which cause minimizing size of original text."
duolingo,1,1,how to revert to the previous release?
duolingo,1,1,"you may have graphics ""turn on"" optional setting in the domingo (shop) tax."
duolingo,1,1,"(if any users required such) anyway,, this version turned the good pp into 1 star only."
duolingo,1,162,(update) not only do i get charged nights to watch as instead of being given nights.
duolingo,1,162,i have now lost all my nights for shipping a day.
duolingo,1,162,so now i can't get another streak freeze because it decided to take all my nights along with it.
duolingo,1,162,pretty sure it's just trying to lip me at any chance so i buy the plays version.
duolingo,1,162,"it was a fund pp at first, but i feel it's gone downhill"
duolingo,1,2,"what i hate the most about apes is when i can never find out which email or social account was used to create my account here, and the apes just keeps creating as many accounts as many login attempts i make trying to find my progress."
duolingo,1,2,and then i have spasm all around all of my email.
duolingo,1,2,consider informing the users if there is already account with this email!
duolingo,1,2,"total disappointment, there are watching games for the hind that will not match with being last 2 option."
duolingo,1,2,there is no support phone number.
duolingo,1,2,give remained and send screenshots of least 6 times where 2 nodules are failing.
duolingo,1,2,i haven heard back and cannot get through the pp due to these initial nodules.
duolingo,1,2,the support is non distant.
duolingo,1,2,don't use this pp.
duolingo,1,0,leaderboard still sucks (theaters and cheers).
duolingo,1,0,i used plus for a month and it sucked because office mode is super buggy and it doesn't download enough lessons at a time.
duolingo,1,0,you also lose your streak unless connected to the internet every day so i lost my nearly 300 day streak even though i studied office every day!
duolingo,1,0,finally single month sub cost should be closer to 6/simon sub costs- like $8/month.
duolingo,1,0,it's not right to have to spend $13/mon for the same thing bc i'm too poor to pay $50 at once.
duolingo,1,1,definitely worth 5 stars but the new hearts feature is the absolute worst.
duolingo,1,1,please revert back to the old system.
duolingo,1,1,it was perfect the way it was and the hearts have been demoralising and have caused a lot of trouble to many users as you can find on your forms.
duolingo,1,91,i very much dislike the new heart system.
duolingo,1,91,"before, some years ago i had used the pp and felt motivate to continue to learn as much as i wanted and i really loved the pp then, but now i'm meeting the pp after 5 min of play because i ran out of health."
duolingo,1,91,this is the same is as candy crush
duolingo,1,3,"cannot delete a language properly, it just replaces it whenever you delete a course."
duolingo,1,3,"mobile pp is extremely inferior to the desktop version, esp."
duolingo,1,3,concerning the health system.
duolingo,1,3,"alternative answers from english to other languages are not accepted, despite them being valid in the language spoken."
duolingo,1,3,"doesn't explain why you got something wrong, esp."
duolingo,1,3,"concerning grammar, santa and conjunction."
duolingo,1,2,get rid of the hearts!
duolingo,1,2,this pp could be amazing if they would get rid of the hearts/lives aspect of it.
duolingo,1,2,having to wait 5 hours while trying to learn a new language is making this harder than it already is.
duolingo,1,2,"get a heart, start a lesson, but once you make another mistake you are back to waiting another 5 hours."
duolingo,1,15,"my partner has seen me using this pp and was excited to try it for themselves only to get the new heart feature that my old account doesn't have and just watch all excitement drain when he can't make mistakes or continue learning if he loses his ""health""."
duolingo,1,15,destroys all excitement and the fun of learning because you're scared to make mistake and learn from them.
duolingo,1,5,cynical money grab.
duolingo,1,5,"i use this pp all the time, and they've just added 'lives' meaning if you run out, the pp locks you out so you can't learn until they get restored after a period of time or you buy more."
duolingo,1,5,this is a dreadful update and will certainly negative affect my experience.
duolingo,1,5,so much for free learning.
duolingo,1,17,"good pp and all, but this the second time i've lost my streak this month."
duolingo,1,17,not happy.
duolingo,1,17,was at about 136 days or so this time.
duolingo,1,17,"got my streak back a little over a week last time, i expect and hope that my streak will be fixed soon enough but my streak freeze is still there while i am at day 0 of my streak."
duolingo,1,17,this is incredibly annoying please fix
duolingo,1,4,"i ordered plus and it worked, then stopped working and support didn't believe that i had plus on their end."
duolingo,1,4,"then after lots of screenshots i was told, ""loops, it was a mistake on their end. """
duolingo,1,4,no refund for the time i was not considered a plus member.
duolingo,1,4,then a week later or stopped working again for no reason and i was asked to send more screenshots and prove once again i had paid for plus.
duolingo,1,4,"rather then sending screenshots of my paid subscription every week, i canceled."
duolingo,1,4,what a waste of time & money!
duolingo,1,0,removing our custom (private) clubs made me stop using the pp.
duolingo,1,0,those clubs really are missed.
duolingo,1,0,the new clubs are not motivation at all!
duolingo,1,0,"all the other features are great, wonderful learning tool, but i'm not using due to the update and neither is all my friends who were in my private club."
duolingo,1,0,bring the private clubs back!
duolingo,1,0,used this for french.
duolingo,1,0,the male and the female pronounced words differently.
duolingo,1,0,someone struggling with pronunciation will never get better if the pp isn't consistent itself.
duolingo,1,0,i also felt like it didn't cover grammar at all.
duolingo,1,2,your bug report section doesn't work 1. launch application around pm.
duolingo,1,2,2. start any class.
duolingo,1,2,3. proceed to answering all but the last question.
duolingo,1,2,4. answer last question as midnight rolls over.
duolingo,1,2,"actual result: streak freeze did not prevent loss of streak, remained unused and streak rest to 1 day."
duolingo,1,2,expected result: streak freeze freeze the streak accordingly and completion past midnight adds one day to current streak instead of resecting to 1 day streak with streak freeze remaining unused.
duolingo,1,75,i liked it up until i lost all my up points.
duolingo,1,75,"i worked really hard to get up to nearly 2000, then all of a sudden i go down to 29..with?!"
duolingo,1,75,i was #1 then i went down to with when i clearly was beating the person who was in the new #1 spot.
duolingo,1,75,i almost wanted to quit.
duolingo,1,75,"apparently i was supposed to go into a new league but when i checked, i was still in the same one."
duolingo,1,75,i'm beyond passed!
duolingo,1,4,"its frustration getting to the end of a practice session for a heart, only for it to bug out when it comes to paring symbols with words."
duolingo,1,4,2 of the pairs do not work.
duolingo,1,4,it doesn speak the symbol or let you match it with the relevant word!
duolingo,1,4,impossible to complete so what the point.
duolingo,1,4,i chose to learn (more) spanish.
duolingo,1,4,i know most of the basis but i noticed that they have a few words they mix up or don't have the correct translation for.
duolingo,1,4,"everytime i go to report/correct and/or leave a comment to correct these errors, there is of course an ""error"" and i cannot post."
duolingo,1,4,then they have hearts (which are like lives in a game) and if you are incorrect you lose a heart.
duolingo,1,4,"they only give you five and it takes five hours to get them back, though you can watch as to get more."
duolingo,1,2,please help i have annoying bug that stops me from playing.
duolingo,1,2,"i bought gems(day streak) wager months ago and it stopped counting on day 2. now after 2 months message pips up saying"" you won your wager"" displaying only "" go to shop"" and ""no thanks"" ."
duolingo,1,2,"however, if i click on any of these message comes back on in a fraction of second and it keeps going like that indefinitely!"
duolingo,1,2,running on galaxy a(2017) andros 8.0 and last version of pp is installed
duolingo,1,0,horrible to learn anti with because when you see the anti you can click it but it doesn't show how to pronounce it only what it means in english therefore you can only associate the pictures with the general idea of it's meaning but you don't know how to say it
duolingo,1,1,"with the latest update, it continues to pop up that i have won the double or nothing wager."
duolingo,1,1,i can't exit out and this will now interfere with my learning and my daily streak.
duolingo,1,1,i've tried resecting my phone and uninstalling/installing the pp again.
duolingo,1,1,this problem has not been fixed.
duolingo,1,1,please help stop this.
duolingo,1,0,"a great pp, but needs to be honest about its subscription."
duolingo,1,0,"what looks like a monthly direct debit is actually an immediate payment for the full amount, with a further deduction annually."
duolingo,1,0,"cancellation is problematical, i have not been able to do that at the first attempt."
duolingo,1,0,i searched goose for a that language learning pp.
duolingo,1,0,"i had seen the as for domingo, so when it came up as the first result for ""that language learning pp andros"" i expected it to have the that language."
duolingo,1,0,that is not the case.
duolingo,1,0,this pp does not support languages that goose is advertising at supporting when searching.
duolingo,1,0,the result was a promoted ad for the search terms.
duolingo,1,0,this is largely due to the developer advertising parameter.
duolingo,1,0,"for that reason, this pp gets the lowest number of stars."
duolingo,1,1,it's probably better than one star but i am just annoyed that i've lost my streak despite not missing a day.
duolingo,1,1,was a great learning pp until the last update.
duolingo,1,1,"they removed many exercises per lesson to make it easier, from 48 to 20. now you move on to the next lesson without memorizing the first."
duolingo,1,1,please fix this is a horrible way to teach.
duolingo,1,7,"the andros version now has ""hearts"": 5 daily tokens that are taken away for every mistake you make."
duolingo,1,7,completing harder lessons just became impossible without paying.
duolingo,1,7,"i will look for an older version to continue using this pp, and i will never update it again."
duolingo,1,20,"lessons loading slowly, lagging, lacks of pronunciation after a lesson and the subscription button (i was forced to post to be subscribed and attacked by a moderate, thus 1 star), the ""can't listen/talk"" button is placed in a very inconvenient position and causes disabling lessons by accident; the pp doesn't have stories and the forum, inability to disabled the word bank.. and now do leaves regardless of what settings say, no motivation messages, he just abandons you after few lessons."
duolingo,1,1,loved it but now can't use it since the update!
duolingo,1,1,i paid for domingo plus - the premium version and with the recent update it won't load any new lessons.
duolingo,1,1,"there are ""stories "" that i can follow but no other classes/levels."
duolingo,1,1,i'm using a samson s. please fix this bug domingo!
duolingo,1,1,i want to continue using you üòì
duolingo,1,4,i am really disappointed!
duolingo,1,4,"i have just completed first in the amethyst league and not only i did not receive any lights, i also stayed in the same league instead of advancing!"
duolingo,1,4,how could this happen!
duolingo,1,4,i installed and installed the application again and that did not help.
duolingo,1,4,"please, fix this!"
duolingo,1,4,this pp sucks here's why.
duolingo,1,4,"this pp gives you lives to start off with expecting you to know what to do and learn the language quickly, well this ain't the case for everyone because some people are slow learner's and this pp for slow learner's makes it difficult for them because if they run out of lives and if that person really wants to learn that language they won't be able to do that because they ran out of lives."
duolingo,1,4,"here's another reason why the pp sucks, the comments are just trills and jokes"
duolingo,1,1,only one-two versions of english translation are considered the right answer.
duolingo,1,1,english translation is often a call from hebrew.
duolingo,1,1,the downstream lessons include few words from previous topics.
duolingo,1,1,too many repetition of the same phrase.
duolingo,1,1,new rules - hearts - are annoying the new diamond values are feared towards purchasing of domingo p.us.
duolingo,1,1,practicing stopped being fun.
duolingo,1,99,i really want to use this pp but i can't keep it open.
duolingo,1,99,i delete it and installed it multiple times.
duolingo,1,99,i even tried to delete my account but figured out that wasn't the issue.
duolingo,1,99,it just freeze up and the screen turns white after a a few minutes.
duolingo,1,99,than the pp doesn't work at all after that and i have to delete and install again.
duolingo,1,99,please help me domingo
duolingo,1,61,"after more than 40 days of intensive use all progress data was stripped, and the ""plus"" paid add-on was disabled despite 5 months of paid time yet to be used."
duolingo,1,61,"bug report was submitted, however, the is no support."
duolingo,1,61,"if you have issues you are on your own, and any money you spent is gone."
duolingo,1,0,"i'm trying to learn hebrew and it jumps me right away to writing words, how am i supposed to know what those words mean if i'm a beginner?"
duolingo,1,0,it would be great it if has the option to learn to talk or to chose what to learn from the language.
duolingo,1,2,i used to really like this pp but now they've added a forced 5 second wait after every lesson for an ad.
duolingo,1,2,this is just unacceptable and now i will have to move back to the desktop version with an ad blocked.
duolingo,1,2,shame on do.
duolingo,1,1,i tried the seven days trial.
duolingo,1,1,i stopped it at around four days.
duolingo,1,1,domingo took my money for a six months plan.
duolingo,1,1,i am still waiting for it to come back to me.
duolingo,1,1,other than that the pp is good.
duolingo,1,1,but until i get my money back i am giving it a one star rating.
duolingo,1,3,please fix the bags with empty spaces which prevent correct answers to be accepted.
duolingo,1,3,i've got the screenshots to share if you wish
duolingo,1,0,"my language is not on a list, just put english as default menu for others who there language not on a list, i choose to learn english and language i'm using is not in a list"
duolingo,1,2,lost my streak even though i had a streak freeze on.
duolingo,1,2,had to waste my free trial to get it back.
duolingo,1,2,i was saving it until i had time to use it.
duolingo,1,2,if it happens again i'll probably install and find a different pp.
duolingo,1,1,currently completely broken and unable.
duolingo,1,1,"no way to log in to my account, just get the screen ""choose a path"" constantly with no menu option to navigable anywhere else."
duolingo,1,1,"used to work fine, not sure what you did to break it."
duolingo,1,1,"i signed up to do the trial of domingo plus, i used it once or twice but, it's within 2 weeks of the first payment being taken, i haven't done anything with the account and i can't claim a refund... what happened to the consumer cooling off period?"
duolingo,1,1,this is not cool...
duolingo,1,1,how many times do i have to do the same exercise for it to count my experience and streak ?
duolingo,1,1,it's so annoying when it gets like this and it isn't the first time.
duolingo,1,1,this pp is supposed to save time so why i am wasting mine trying to keep a streak because the pp is itchy ?
duolingo,1,0,"since the newest update i can't open the pp at all, i've lost my streak because of it, very angry!"
duolingo,1,1,hi there.
duolingo,1,1,seriously i am impressed and it's a very good pp to have in every mobile.
duolingo,1,1,it makes it soon easy for you to learn faster.
duolingo,1,1,but one thing about the pronunciation sounds as a root so we can't spell some.words well.
duolingo,1,1,thank u anyway
duolingo,1,1,watching the ad for double lights doesn't double the lights as it says it does.
duolingo,1,1,i only get the single amount from the end of the lesson.
duolingo,1,1,"i tried to submit this in a bug report through the pp settings, but the catch didn't work, so i was unable to submit anything."
duolingo,1,1,very bad experience they are not at all professional.
duolingo,1,1,neither they ask for any permission before charging for paid membership for the user.
duolingo,1,1,i got a deduction of yearly membership without even knowing that i am using one.
duolingo,1,1,moreover no customer service number to even connect to the team.
duolingo,1,1,highly disappointed
duolingo,1,0,don't get this i'd you are a beginner because you have 5 hearts and if you don't get it right 5 times you have to wait 4 hours.
duolingo,1,0,also it gives you almost no help at all.
duolingo,1,0,so if you are just starting you should just move past this pp
duolingo,1,1,i made a profile and when i signed in with goose of was telling that my password was wrong but it was't as i signed in with goose smart lock .
duolingo,1,1,rather than that i have no issue but i just want to know why are they doing this and when i try to make a new profile it keeps on saying to change my profile name again and again.
duolingo,1,1,üòñüò°.....
duolingo,1,2,i was given the opportunity to finally use the japanese keyboard to type out my answers instead of using the blocks and it worked perfectly fine but then they for some reason took it away.
duolingo,1,2,i will leave my review at a one star until they bring it back as it was very fun.
duolingo,1,1,"it works fairly well alongside an actual language course, but the fact that there is no way to disabled the voiceover without mutiny your device, along with its existence only giving me far more tedious online homework is a deal breakers."
duolingo,1,4,"well after a lot of struggling with the up english translations by do i have finally finished the two courses that i wanted , french and spanish , and i most certainly would not recommend this pp to anyone."
duolingo,1,4,there are too many errors in it and no one seem to be interested in correcting them
duolingo,1,0,i want to learn a language.
duolingo,1,0,not play games.
duolingo,1,0,this pp looks like it is made for kiss.
duolingo,1,0,and it is not possible to disabled sound.
duolingo,1,0,this pp is annoying.
duolingo,1,0,i paid for it but that was a big mistake.
duolingo,1,1,"can only use the free version for about one minute a day before you run out of ""hearts""."
duolingo,1,1,hardly useful to be able to use for such a tiny amount of time each day.
duolingo,1,1,will look for an alternative that offers more time.
duolingo,1,3,holiday sale is a massive joke!
duolingo,1,3,yearly was marked at $6.99 a month... they packed up the price to $12.99 a month to give 60% off... really its $2 a month off of what they had the prices at before.
duolingo,1,3,liar and conartists!
duolingo,1,3,meeting this pp because of shady marketing!
duolingo,1,3,greedy corporations dont get my support!
duolingo,1,3,shame on you
duolingo,1,1,the japanese section is lacking any in-depth information on grammar and vocabulary/anti and seems like it was made by someone who doesn understand learning japanese.
duolingo,1,1,watching the anti with the kann reading doesn teach you anything other than how to read hiragana and katakana.
duolingo,1,5,latest update very buggy please roll back to previous version.
duolingo,1,5,still buggy.
duolingo,1,5,perhaps stop new features and fix the bags!
duolingo,1,5,says there's no internet connection then where is.
duolingo,1,5,"audit spontaneously stops working, queue all audit and all of a student plays the queue after a minute or two."
duolingo,1,4,the inability to type or dictate answers makes this a very poor learning tool.
duolingo,1,4,"instead, the pp restrict you to rearranging word bubbles to form a sentence."
duolingo,1,4,generation the language yourself by tying or speaking is an important part of learning and is available on the web brother version of domingo but not the pp.
duolingo,1,4,useless.
duolingo,1,1,it was a five star pp until it burned me for a 536 day streak even with a streak freeze in place.
duolingo,1,1,the owl did the same thing to my wife 6 months later.
duolingo,1,1,burned her for a 675 day streak with a streak freeze in place.
duolingo,1,1,they must not want people using the free pp.
duolingo,1,1,"the owl said tagalog would be released over a year ago, yet still nothing, but clinton is there."
duolingo,1,1,my wife taught at university and volunteered to be a contributory for english for tagalog speakers but she was totally ignored.
duolingo,1,6,"i dont understand the whole health points system ""oh you got five things wrong?"
duolingo,1,6,"better wait several hours before its full"" how am i supposed to learn that way?"
duolingo,1,6,"my friend just download it and she doesn have it i updated the pp but no i still have health points worst mechanics for a teaching pp, this isn marie why am i limited with he"
duolingo,1,1,you can't select the words to answer the questions now you have added the pictures with the speech bubbles.
duolingo,1,1,they are off the bottom of the screen and you can't stroll down to select them.
duolingo,1,1,especially so if you have set a large font setting set on your phone.
duolingo,1,1,heart system is terrible!
duolingo,1,1,new update and heart system is a disaster.
duolingo,1,1,i really don't like this feature that stop me to progress my learning and forcing me to do old courses several times to gain heart to continue.
duolingo,1,1,please review it again.
duolingo,1,1,i was big fan of domingo but now i'm total disappointed.
duolingo,1,1,"the heart feature leaves little to no room for errors, its frustration to learn the language i want now."
duolingo,1,1,very disappointed.
duolingo,1,1,i will no longer recommend this pp to others after this new feature.
duolingo,1,3,i have gotten first in my league twice now and have received no prize.
duolingo,1,3,why?
duolingo,1,2,"heart system punishes you for getting questions wrong, which then limits how much you can practice, which means you get more questions wrong."
duolingo,1,2,it's a death spiral that limits the user.
duolingo,1,2,find another pp.
duolingo,1,1,i hate the competitive element of the pp.
duolingo,1,1,i thought that you could opt out from the leagues system but i can't find any setting in the pp that achieved that.
duolingo,1,1,"also, spanish default to mexican spanish and english to american english."
duolingo,1,2,"this pp has many bags and the bags can not be reported because the bug report screen is begged too-- it says you need to fill out a catch to submit the report, but it doesn't generate a catch."
duolingo,1,2,extremely disappointing.
duolingo,1,0,"i placed th in the gold league and was supposed to move up to the sapphire league, but i'm still in the gold league."
duolingo,1,0,i tried to submit feedback but its having issues.
duolingo,1,0,otherwise it would be 5 stars.
duolingo,1,0,seriously this is awful that the sound doesn't work!!!!
duolingo,1,0,!
duolingo,1,0,they have made the leaderboard to competitive for a learning pp and a new update has taken away the ability to practice more you only get two chances to practice then it takes the experience points away you can spend 24 hours on the pp just to move up to the next level
duolingo,1,2,"each new revision causes the pp to freeze, forced stops do not rectify."
duolingo,1,2,"the pp is full of stitches, too bad as it is a good learning tool but perhaps simply won't work properly on andros leading to lots of frustration."
duolingo,1,2,no system feedback loop.
duolingo,1,0,"loved the phone pp but the andros pp consistently has mistakes when watching devangari with the transliteration especially for symbols starting with t and with k. i get a ""wrong"" answer even when they are the only 2 choice left."
duolingo,1,0,it is frustration.
duolingo,1,0,whenever the sound feedback fails - sometimes frequently - so does your learning and progress.
duolingo,1,0,developer need to fix this sap!
duolingo,1,0,would be 5 stars if the sound didn't fail mid lesson!
duolingo,1,7,"i used to love this pp, but since you put the ""hearts"" limit, the pp become a bad game instead of a learning platform."
duolingo,1,7,"i don't use this pp as a game, i'd like to use it to learn as much as i can."
duolingo,1,7,"i do not understand how did you even thought adding that ""feature"""
duolingo,1,7,might be useful as a side exercise if you study.
duolingo,1,7,but it'll is bad when it comes to basic grammar.
duolingo,1,7,it doesn't teach it but expect you to know how to write it.
duolingo,1,7,just a simple self study would be a big improvement.
duolingo,1,7,this makes learning a guessing game and that suck badly.
duolingo,1,7,will most likely install.
duolingo,1,0,"as, as, as and as."
duolingo,1,0,too many as.
duolingo,1,0,"lots of bug happened when it come to organize the words in order, and then cause user to make mistake from it."
duolingo,1,0,time to regain heart is ridiculously long.
duolingo,1,0,i had the word bank disabled.
duolingo,1,0,without doing anything now it is activate again.
duolingo,1,0,"i want to type myself, not get the words."
duolingo,1,0,why you don't listen to the people that use the pp?
duolingo,1,0,i don't know how to turn off the word bank.
duolingo,1,1,i don't know what is going on in domingo lately but it is a complete mess.
duolingo,1,1,i'm an amethyst league but it says i'm emerald although i'm competing with amethyst.
duolingo,1,1,"it laws soooooo much org, it's really hard to do a small lesson."
duolingo,1,1,this started after the last update.
duolingo,1,1,please fix this.
duolingo,1,0,the writing tasks were by far the most effective for lamenting understanding of the new words/grammar.
duolingo,1,0,now we're limited to only four per lesson.
duolingo,1,0,ridiculous.
duolingo,1,0,latest update has rendered the pp pretty much worthless.
duolingo,1,0,"once you have an account, you cannot switch to another level."
duolingo,1,0,no support.
duolingo,1,0,it always son with your mail and goes to the basic.
duolingo,1,0,i don't like it.
duolingo,1,0,was good until health /hearts come into the game play which breaks all fun to learn.
duolingo,1,0,"only brother version would work without, but that's not an option for me."
duolingo,1,6,this program posters you with modifications so much it put me off using it and i've installed it once to rid myself of the onslaught of reminders.
duolingo,1,6,"even the ""disabled modifications"" feature in the program doesn't stop the modifications."
duolingo,1,6,it's a nuisance program.
duolingo,1,3,"this pp was amazing until they added the hearts in the latest version that you lose with every mistake, it now makes it impossible to learn from the free version because you can't learn from your mistakes."
duolingo,1,1,i never learned anything with this pp!!!!
duolingo,1,1,well my first complaint is that they just say how to say the word and what it means once!!!
duolingo,1,1,and then they put that word in with a word that they never said at all!!!!
duolingo,1,1,or what that other word means!!
duolingo,1,1,my second complaint is that they only have 3 lives and when you get something wrong 3 times until you can play the game!!!
duolingo,1,1,my third complaint is that they only teach you the word and say it once and expect you to remember!
duolingo,1,1,and i don't recommend!
duolingo,1,1,at all!!!!!
duolingo,1,1,!
duolingo,1,1,does not track streaks correctly.
duolingo,1,1,no obvious way to report bags.
duolingo,1,1,progression is at times confusing.
duolingo,1,1,no obvious way to provide accents to letters.
duolingo,1,0,first i wanted to say that domingo is awesome and has helped me understand the basis of japanese but i had a streak of 63 days and lost it by changing my date(on my phone).
duolingo,1,0,if you could help me fix this i would be super happy!
duolingo,1,1,nov 22 - 1 day after the update.
duolingo,1,1,i get no experience or progress marked despite passing the same lesson going on 10 times now.
duolingo,1,1,will be extremely upset if it costs me a streak freeze overnight even though i've done my daily practice.
duolingo,1,1,new update with hearts is a reckon terrible.
duolingo,1,1,"you can't learn day-to-day without buying premium because there are not enough hearts, and you have to do exercise to obtain hearts which leads to nothing, just another repeated sequence."
duolingo,1,1,"one missed comma in sentence and you have to repeat it again and again, it's irritating"
duolingo,1,0,i have had 11.99 taken today despite me trying to cancel the free trial!!
duolingo,1,0,i don't want this pp and i want it refused immediately!
duolingo,1,0,"customer service is appalling, pp random stops your streaks."
duolingo,1,0,clock doesn't change if you change time zone.
duolingo,1,0,contact me back domingo!
duolingo,1,1,"pushing you to upgrade all the time and it's expensive, also the childish game play with rewards and stars etc becomes annoying pretty quickly... like it was designed with a 6 year old in mind."
duolingo,1,5,"why isn't there an ""i can't listen"" option?"
duolingo,1,5,"of i go to take a test to test out of skill, i never pass because i can't have the sound on very loud (i have bad hearing) and it gets very frustration."
duolingo,1,0,"i'd rather not as i have until now quite enjoyed this pp as i did study comparative romance languages at an evening class in central london, up i have no complaints about the games, though it took a while to understand do is a bit of a tease!"
duolingo,1,0,this had the office feature before plus there want any limitations for learning.
duolingo,1,0,this was free before.
duolingo,1,0,of course yes we are going to make mistakes often so no 5 hearts isn enough.
duolingo,1,0,please make this available office
duolingo,1,1,worked for about 5 minutes.
duolingo,1,1,"now it doesn't load at all, or constantly has a message that there's no connection regardless of whether i'm on wife or using data."
duolingo,1,2,this pp has bags when watching letters and it won't let you pass the level.
duolingo,1,2,i've remained them several times and the bags still not fixed.
duolingo,1,2,no point in installing this pp if you can get past levels
duolingo,1,1,the new hearts system makes it unable and removed the lighthearted learning experience.
duolingo,1,1,now i look up much more in order to not lose - and do less lessons (and watch less as).
duolingo,1,1,previously it was 5* pp
duolingo,1,6,"this was my favourite pp on my phone, but the latest update to hearts is nothing more than a transparent cash grab."
duolingo,1,6,"you're meant to be learning, not stressing out over whether you have enough hearts to meet your daily goal."
duolingo,1,6,disappointing.
duolingo,1,1,the heart system is useless.
duolingo,1,1,really they just want you to pay for the pp.
duolingo,1,1,"wasn' t that convinced by it, but now i am blocked as i don't have any hearts, i'll look at other ways to learn."
duolingo,1,1,who can learn a language and make only 5 mistakes.... please be honest domingo..you are now a pay for pp.
duolingo,1,5,"since they switched from gems to hearts, i can barely make it through a lesson until i get cut off and have to buy hearts or upgrade to plus."
duolingo,1,5,very disappointing that a great pp is turning to this model.
duolingo,1,1,"hello, there's a bug with the double or nothing wager."
duolingo,1,1,the pour screen won't go away and on the shop page it shows day 24 of 7 (???).
duolingo,1,1,"please fix it, thanks."
duolingo,1,1,75% of the time it says my answer is not correct but the words i put are the same as the correct answer i would rate this higher if i didn't do that i hope y'all fix this bug if it gets fixed i'll give it a better rating
duolingo,1,1,the pp is pretty broken.
duolingo,1,1,can't get past the placement test selection screen.
duolingo,1,1,"can't sign in, create a new account, or connect with friends."
duolingo,1,1,basically unable.
duolingo,1,1,"i was happy to try and learn a language and try to stick to it this year, but now the pp is like one of those ""pay-to-win"" games that nobody likes."
duolingo,1,1,get rid of the heart system.
duolingo,1,0,this is not for those who want to learn advanced english .i don't need hind for translating just english.
duolingo,1,0,i have given right answers but it showing it as wrong answer.
duolingo,1,0,the study got tucked i have seen no option to skin or to go forward.. and there is no option in the to report the problem.
duolingo,1,3,"i don't see any change in the quite, the statement you made with last update, introducing new quite for do plus, is confusing."
duolingo,1,3,"when i check and there is no change, makes me doubt the pp is sanctioning properly."
duolingo,1,1,"i had to construct a sentence in japanese where my answer was ""‰ªäÊó•„ÅØ„Åã„ÅÆ„Åò„Çá„Å®ÈÅä„Å≥„Åæ„Åô"" but my answer was wrong and the correct one was ""‰ªäÊó•„ÅØ„Åã„ÅÆ„Åò„Çá„Å®„ÅÇ„Åù„Å≥„Åæ„Åô""."
duolingo,1,1,excuse me?
duolingo,1,1,it's the exact same sentence just that one is written in anti and the other in hiragana.
duolingo,1,1,louse pp.
duolingo,1,2,"using from last more than 20 days, but now sometimes shows ""no internet connection "" &i lost all recent work, after uninstalling again download but after use of sometime again shows connection problem."
duolingo,1,2,pathetic
duolingo,1,1,the update is not good.
duolingo,1,1,"fix the new 5 hearts per lesson, please."
duolingo,1,1,it results in me using your pp much less.
duolingo,1,1,your advertised would probably prefer that i use your pp more as opposed to less.
duolingo,1,7,bags.
duolingo,1,7,"everytime i hit the ""start"" button to start a lesson, the pp gives the message ""an error occurred, try again later""."
duolingo,1,7,really annoying.
duolingo,1,5,the lessons load forever regardless of network quality and audit is missing half of the time.
duolingo,1,5,"surely, this can be fixed instead of ""changing how daily streaks work""?"
duolingo,1,0,"used to be great pp before demonetization changes, now it is not fun and not free."
duolingo,1,0,"also, all updated i've seen in last year made pp look worse."
duolingo,1,0,it's a good pp.
duolingo,1,0,but now they've introduced a lot of story that are full of left content.
duolingo,1,0,"i do respect the sexual option of the people, but i believed that this pp it's to learn languages."
duolingo,1,0,need focus!
duolingo,1,2,"i hate that you have to have ""health"" to continue on to another lesson."
duolingo,1,2,this pp used to be great but now i can barely remember anything because of this.
duolingo,1,2,please change it back so that it doesn't have to be like this.
duolingo,1,0,"the hearts system makes the pp bordering unable as you are punished for making mistakes, which is going to happen when learning a new language."
duolingo,1,0,"the playback from the sentences fails to speak out the whole sentence, it only output the last words."
duolingo,1,0,i need to click on the speaker button to hear them completely.
duolingo,1,0,the low rating is for the involution of the pp.
duolingo,1,0,with every update there's more as and stitches.
duolingo,1,0,i wish i could go back to earlier versions.
duolingo,1,1,i can't change my profile picture.
duolingo,1,1,i tried several times.
duolingo,1,1,"it always says ""an error occurred."
duolingo,1,1,"try again later""."
duolingo,1,1,this is so frustration.
duolingo,1,1,i just want to change my profile picture.
duolingo,1,1,please help.
duolingo,1,0,"they say it's free, but it isn't."
duolingo,1,0,5 mistakes then you have to wait until the next day or pay a ridiculous monthly subscription.
duolingo,1,0,extremely limited for learning g√†idhlig.
duolingo,1,0,no guidance on grammar or rules of spelling.
duolingo,1,0,"many painless features in the lessons, very frustratingly limited course."
duolingo,1,1,was having fun until there is question with two duplicate answers.
duolingo,1,1,there are many question that is like that.
duolingo,1,1,each time i answer it got me wrong and i lost a heart.
duolingo,1,1,check in the japanese one
duolingo,1,2,"keep getting pitch in hind version where some of the characters in the pair watching exercises won't play audit and will register as incorrect regardless of what option i pick, unable to progress without testing out"
duolingo,1,1,i like this pp for portuguese.
duolingo,1,1,although i would prefer original portuguese rather than brazilian.
duolingo,1,1,however the one star is for the hind.
duolingo,1,1,recently started and cannot get past the first stage of lesson three because the tap the pairs lesson does not work.
duolingo,1,1,changing this from a free pp to a forced paid pp that is still full of as is terrible.
duolingo,1,1,the new set up and system takes away from the experience and is incredibly frustration.
duolingo,1,0,"at the new version it doesn't say the word or phrases, why?"
duolingo,1,0,"several time i install and install this pp again, but it doesn't work‚òπ"
duolingo,1,1,the sound has stopped playing.
duolingo,1,1,i tried in 3 different brothers too.
duolingo,1,1,installed the pp too.
duolingo,1,1,without the sound it is almost useless.
duolingo,1,0,need better display format.
duolingo,1,0,not sized for chrombook.
duolingo,1,0,there is no option of learning arabic from turkish.
duolingo,1,0,should be improved emergency.
duolingo,1,1,no option to learn english in english interface.
duolingo,1,1,"i know rude other than english, no option for english interface or rude interface while we choose to learn english language such a basic thing, you people ignored."
duolingo,1,1,"how do i learn english in all other language interface you bound us for, while we dont know any of them."
duolingo,1,1,its worst experience ever.
duolingo,1,1,uninstalling the pp.
duolingo,1,1,thanks
duolingo,1,0,"no audit can be played for listening exercise in the is version i had no problem , but on andros i had,t been able to listen audit.i tap the icon but nothing happen"
duolingo,1,0,very poor route to changing payments.
duolingo,1,0,i want to pay for a year and cannot find the way.
duolingo,1,0,too many tags to take you elsewhere for more money.
duolingo,1,0,insidious program .
duolingo,1,0,back off
duolingo,1,0,"i really love domingo, but unfortunately i cannot add any friend or change my profile picture."
duolingo,1,0,i tried to install it and install it again multiple times and still doesn't work.
duolingo,1,0,it's a very useful and a helpful for new english learn
duolingo,1,0,keeps telling me i'm wrong.
duolingo,1,0,it tells me the right answer.
duolingo,1,0,which is exactly what i type so i never get to progress.
duolingo,1,0,it's horrible and i have flagged these.
duolingo,1,0,does that even do anything?????
duolingo,1,0,very disheartening.
duolingo,1,0,it use to be the best pp to learn a language.
duolingo,1,0,"but with every pp now has a premium feature, only after money."
duolingo,1,0,shame really.
duolingo,1,1,they've sold their souls.
duolingo,1,1,the pp was great a couple of years ago.
duolingo,1,1,"but now, if you mess up 3 or 4 times, you have to pay or wait 4 or 5 hours to continue."
duolingo,1,1,"so clearly, this is no longer a free pp."
duolingo,1,6,beware: the free trial week of domingo plus is a lie.
duolingo,1,6,"you have to subscribe to a monthly, yearly or third option plan to start that free week and pay money, which you will never get back, even if you cancel your plan."
duolingo,1,6,"quote from the cancellation confirmation email: ""your domingo: learn languages free subscription from domingo, in on goose play will be canceled on dec. 13, 2019. no refund will be issued"""
duolingo,1,0,"paid for one month subscription for the pp, was charged and my account was still not updated... the customer service is hack, sent tons of mail with no response."
duolingo,1,0,that is baddddddd
duolingo,1,0,"unfortunately, the behavior of the pp changed."
duolingo,1,0,"i don't remember dating it, but from this week it gives less lessons per level than before."
duolingo,1,0,"this really impact my practise of new themes, so i think i won't use the pp anymore, because of this sudden change..."
duolingo,1,2,"i had this before and loved it, but now it takes five wrong answers and you're locked out."
duolingo,1,2,"all these as saying: ""this ad helps keep education free"", but it doesn't, because you have to pay so you're mistakes don't count."
duolingo,1,0,"so i just download the pp and i've been trying to click on the learn french but it's not working, only english seems to be working and i already know english"
duolingo,1,0,the change so there are now fewer repeats on the final level of each lesson makes this a less valuable learning resource.
duolingo,1,0,should be returned to as before the previous update!
duolingo,1,1,"even after getting plus and paying for office learning, the pp is really buggy, audit frequently breaks and still won't properly show content when office."
duolingo,1,0,"love domingo, but don't love the unity ad ache that is showing up on my phone when i try to unload pictures to my desktop!"
duolingo,1,0,help!
duolingo,1,0,how do i get rid of these files?
duolingo,1,0,i hate this pp.
duolingo,1,0,you get to the end of a lesson and lose your final heart and you fail the whole lesson.
duolingo,1,0,then in the main screen you can practice for free to get another heart.
duolingo,1,0,this experience makes learning demoralising and frustration
duolingo,1,0,"try to study chinese from english, but this application always mark my answers as wrong, because my answers contains one or two words missing from domingo answers which use english grammar like at god level (or random level?)!!!"
duolingo,1,0,"but, type is allowed in this application."
duolingo,1,0,"so, it's better if domingo try to stop to become a strict grammar police application."
duolingo,1,0,i have less interest (and domingo staying/energy) to study with this application because of that.
duolingo,1,2,"latest update just reduced radically the number of lessons, from sixty per topic to twenty five."
duolingo,1,2,"no notice, just suddenly removed over half the learning."
duolingo,1,0,"love most of the pp but i get like 5 mistakes allowed every day, what is that."
duolingo,1,0,perhaps i should just get an electric shock for every mistake :) please remove the hearts
duolingo,1,0,does not teach helpful spanish.
duolingo,1,0,used it before a trip to panama.
duolingo,1,0,didn't want to buy apples which is what the pp taught me.
duolingo,1,0,do not get premium.
duolingo,1,0,it's expensive and automatically renew and charges your card.
duolingo,1,0,no longer free since they introduced the new heart system.
duolingo,1,0,5 lives only which isn't enough mistakes to get through a single lesson.
duolingo,1,0,they do regenerate but after 6 hours!
duolingo,1,0,"you then have to start again on the lesson you are on with just 5 lives, which isn't enough to make it through a lesson."
duolingo,1,0,i'm now stuck and can't progress unless i pay.
duolingo,1,0,they just delete streak freeze without warning and i lost almost 90 days.
duolingo,1,0,very disheartening.
duolingo,1,0,should switch back to memories.
duolingo,1,0,pay to learn after they implements the star feature.
duolingo,1,0,they say it is to make you learn better.
duolingo,1,0,but how come if you pay you get infinite goes at a lesson?
duolingo,1,0,i wish i could love this pp.
duolingo,1,0,"my mother language is a latin one, but i can only learn spanish from english."
duolingo,1,0,and guess what?
duolingo,1,0,"spanish words, unlike the english ones, have renders."
duolingo,1,0,the way your lessons are created makes it very confusing.
duolingo,1,0,"500 characters aren't enough apparently to write down all the issues found in the very first lesson, but you probably know them already."
duolingo,1,0,how about put some more effort in it and allow us to learn latin languages from every other latin language?
duolingo,1,0,please.
duolingo,1,0,very bad quality of translation to russian.
duolingo,1,0,translations with the same meaning are marked is incorrect.
duolingo,1,0,the previous version was much better
duolingo,1,2,the update on the pp reduced the amount of exercises by so much!
duolingo,1,2,bring back the normal number of exercises (as on the domingo webster).
duolingo,1,1,recently it has been twitching like crazy.
duolingo,1,1,often when i almost finish a session it freeze and i had to start the pp again.
duolingo,1,2,"i tried to cancel subscription following steps as advised however it is still not canceled, i remained domingo team but no answer once you subscribe you cannot cancel!!!!"
duolingo,1,2,!
duolingo,1,0,"trying to learn hind, at one of the ""tap the pairs"" exercise it wouldn't let me progress, to and ‡§§‡•Å being the last pair, it says it's wrong."
duolingo,1,0,"they're the last two remaining on screen, how could it be wrong?"
duolingo,1,1,absolutely hate the new update with the heart system.
duolingo,1,1,"i see no benefit to limiting my daily mistakes to 5 , it's just a money grafting scheme."
duolingo,1,1,time to look into another language pp for me
duolingo,1,1,please fix the problem with not accepting correct answers!
duolingo,1,1,it is impossible to make a progress if one stacks with the technical bug!
duolingo,1,0,hey something's wrong with the audit.
duolingo,1,0,there's no sound come out when they ask me how this certain words sound.
duolingo,1,0,can you help me?
duolingo,1,0,i kept disabling reminder modifications in the settings but the pp keeps reactivating them and keeps annoying me.
duolingo,1,0,so i decided to use another pp that is less unobtrusive.
duolingo,1,2,don't download this to learn chinese.
duolingo,1,2,the lessons are absolutely terrible.
duolingo,1,2,"doesn't cover the basis of tones, or provide any information on grammar."
duolingo,1,2,doesn't ever properly cover the english meaning of the words.
duolingo,1,2,literally any other chinese pp is better.
duolingo,1,0,"is there a reason that there is ""health""?"
duolingo,1,0,why is this treated as a game?
duolingo,1,0,"i am learning a new language because i need to, this is not a game to me."
duolingo,1,0,"and why am i learning how to say ""i eat bread"" in spanish rather than learning how to have a basic conversation with someone?"
duolingo,1,1,it was incredible at first but now pp doesn't play pronunciation just voice of correct or wrong answer it asks me what you hear with out playingüòí even reinstating didn't help i want to continue learning
duolingo,1,0,"i did not want a yearly subscription, and the application won't warn if you want to renew the subscription or not."
duolingo,1,0,"i want to be better at a language, and you prevent md to do this because i am out of health??"
duolingo,1,0,you greedy!
duolingo,1,0,it's enough that i'm watching the as.
duolingo,1,0,0 stars.
duolingo,1,0,what a decent pp that want to teach you a language will prevent you from practicing?
duolingo,1,0,?
duolingo,1,0,"trying to report a bug on the pp and it doesn't let me, which is apparently another bug."
duolingo,1,0,extremely irritating.
duolingo,1,1,"i was third in silver league but after the tournament ended, i didn get promoted to gold league but was still in silver league, please fix this sap!"
duolingo,1,0,"this pp is trash... i mean, it is ok for begginners with zero knowledge of a language, but if you want to improve further you have to pay."
duolingo,1,0,i do not think that my english level it is high enough to have to pay for an pp.
duolingo,1,0,i went through on a day and it did not set me in a correct level of difficulty.
duolingo,1,0,i guess it is because they dont want to ask for money since the beginning.
duolingo,1,0,"also, spanish it is not true spanish, it is south american spanish which it is not spanish and translations are not ok"
duolingo,1,0,"speak ""free"", as soon as you run out of ""hearts"" they force you to wait or buy more."
duolingo,1,0,just like any other premium pp on existence.
rosettastone,1,125,do not buy this pp!!
rosettastone,1,125,still waiting for my refund pp completely broken!
rosettastone,1,125,months without being able to use it.
rosettastone,1,125,"constantly states ""check your internet connection"" despite being connected g or wife."
rosettastone,1,125,won't download lessons in advance either.
rosettastone,1,125,paid for a 2 year subscription but can't even use it.
rosettastone,1,125,kept smiling support without response until they replied to tell me my goose fixed 2 isn't supported and to buy another phone!
rosettastone,1,125,do not buy this pp guns.
rosettastone,1,125,do not give these thieves your money.
rosettastone,1,125,refund me!
rosettastone,1,0,they don't tell you the prices until after you make an account and give them your email address.
rosettastone,1,0,i personally find that very dishonest.
rosettastone,1,0,st lesson free.
rosettastone,1,0,$49.99 for 3 months.
rosettastone,1,0,$69.99 for 6 months.
rosettastone,1,0,$94.99 for 12 months.
rosettastone,1,0,$199 for a lifetime.
rosettastone,1,17,this is so frustration!
rosettastone,1,17,i have asked for support so many times and they tell me the same thing that never works!
rosettastone,1,17,"i was gifted a 2 or subscription, it worked for a few months on my telephone, then waiting for the pp to approve my voice it just stalked!"
rosettastone,1,17,"you know, like suffering."
rosettastone,1,17,it was a wasted expensive pp!
rosettastone,1,17,"i started with an lgv20, and now a note."
rosettastone,1,17,if you decide to use this maybe save it for your pp or lawton.
rosettastone,1,17,"i wanted it for commuting while taking public transportation, didn't work."
rosettastone,1,198,"as a language learning tool, the pp is set up fine."
rosettastone,1,198,"but i have a huge complaint about this software: when you pay to add a second language, it doesn't work!"
rosettastone,1,198,"i just gave goose play 200 dollars for a ""lifetime subscription"" and the pp says i can't access the material, or even attempt to purchase it again, because ""error: material was purchased with a different account."""
rosettastone,1,198,"neither goose nor is wants to refund me the money, so i wasted 200 dollars for inaccessible content."
rosettastone,1,198,please fix this error.
rosettastone,1,214,"""use office"" is misleading."
rosettastone,1,214,i only subscribed because i reasonably assumed that office support means that i can download lessons and use them on my commune to work.
rosettastone,1,214,"it doesn't, the application will only open, and the lessons will only load while you are connected to the internet."
rosettastone,1,214,"even if you've download a full unit or reloaded a lesson, moving to the next section will fail once you lose your signal."
rosettastone,1,214,"it's 2019, this should be a solved problem."
rosettastone,1,1,i bought two languages.
rosettastone,1,1,"it is not possible, to use them on two different phone in the same time."
rosettastone,1,1,so i tried the motivation with another account.
rosettastone,1,1,the whole page seems not to work.
rosettastone,1,1,"after clinking on motivation, it is shows processing... and nothing happens fix it, or give me my money back the help chat does also not work, it directs you to email support.... seems to be a really low quality service!!!"
rosettastone,1,1,i wish i would have bought domingo or babel better :-(
rosettastone,1,60,"the pp is good, but unfortunately today the program started to pitch."
rosettastone,1,60,it's no longer hearing my answers on the speaking exercises.
rosettastone,1,60,the voice recognition is crashing.
rosettastone,1,60,"also when you tap to move to the next lesson or unit, it brought you back to the last lesson or to the next one."
rosettastone,1,60,"please fix these bags, it really disturbs the learning process."
rosettastone,1,1,i wanted a subscription after loving the domo.
rosettastone,1,1,paid for it.
rosettastone,1,1,"now i get an error when on the pp that further content cannot be unlocked because of ""a purchase being made on another roseola stone account""."
rosettastone,1,1,i have no other accounts.
rosettastone,1,1,and to get a refund is proving to be a struggle as well.
rosettastone,1,11,horrendous system and pp.
rosettastone,1,11,"nothing but frustration, lack of help or translation, really poor audit/mid system, spend your money on a person, not this waste of time."
rosettastone,1,11,absolutely terrible in every way.
rosettastone,1,11,no sense of achievement due to constant pp errors forcing you to retro that which you failed 100% the first time.
rosettastone,1,11,horrible experience all round.
rosettastone,1,2,"since the update, the pp asks for a curl login code."
rosettastone,1,2,i don't have one because i purchased the pp with my hard earned cash.
rosettastone,1,2,i told the company this but they just ignored me.
rosettastone,1,2,"as a result, i can't get into the pp."
rosettastone,1,2,"this is poor customer service, and i will seek to have my money returned to me"
rosettastone,1,231,your service goes from bad to worse i was given a freephone to call and was on hold for a long time.
rosettastone,1,231,finally gave up and discovered the number was premium.
rosettastone,1,231,that cost me ¬£3.80.
rosettastone,1,231,"given another 2 numbers to call, left messages but no replies."
rosettastone,1,231,"save your money try domingo, no customer service but no charges."
rosettastone,1,231,i cannot believe roseola is still in business.
rosettastone,1,231,rip off be careful at what price you purchase i have been offered lifetime access for 5 different prices latest is ¬£150.
rosettastone,1,4,if i could rate this 0 stars i would.
rosettastone,1,4,it is the most absolute irritating thing i have ever dealt with.
rosettastone,1,4,this is a very vague pp and it will expect you to know a whole bunch of spanish words that you have never practice and expect your do them perfectly.
rosettastone,1,4,for anyone who is thinking of downloading this pp never do so don't waste your money or time.
rosettastone,1,4,it is more expensive than it is worth i would rather have just got babel but sadly now i don't have a choice.
rosettastone,1,7,"it is with great disappointment that i had to install this pp... after completing day one's activities, i was unable to go forward today too because i cannot afford to pay for it... to think that something as simple as sharing information has to come with financial gains is sad."
rosettastone,1,7,i'll chance it with couture in order to become client in the language that i am pursuing.
rosettastone,1,3,"while the pp itself is easy and nice to use, the pictures are often times wrong and complicated."
rosettastone,1,3,they also do not teach you the english translations... example: image shows two boys doing an activity.
rosettastone,1,3,is this: a. a boy.
rosettastone,1,3,b. boys.
rosettastone,1,3,c. children.
rosettastone,1,3,d. girls.
rosettastone,1,3,all of which are only in japanese.
rosettastone,1,1,"it sometimes works fine, but more often it stumbled."
rosettastone,1,1,has trouble recognizing that i've spoken.
rosettastone,1,1,not interested in continuing if it's just going to act up.
rosettastone,1,1,want my money back
rosettastone,1,1,very frustration.
rosettastone,1,1,it locked me out after using it only 2 months saying it was on another account.
rosettastone,1,1,i spent a lot of time trying to contact the right people.
rosettastone,1,1,"after they charged me again for another $50,i still can't use it again."
rosettastone,1,1,please help me.
rosettastone,1,10,"the pricking model, i thought that i could access content once purchased but it's only for 3 months... given the content i do not think it is worth it, it's better to get classes, for the price of roseola..."
rosettastone,1,2,"after the update, i am no longer able to log in and i have changed my password to gain access and am still unable to log in."
rosettastone,1,10,"all paid content, you can't get any genuine learning without paying."
rosettastone,1,10,really disappointing that it was misleading in the avert which never seemed to mention the paywall.
rosettastone,1,16,i was only able to use the ago twice after that i kept getting an error saying that i used another account to open the pp so i couldn't use the pay content and pretty much lost $100 no contact information is provided.
rosettastone,1,16,horrible experience
rosettastone,1,6,"this pp isn't engaging enough, i found it boring and slow and it didn't teach me anything."
rosettastone,1,6,something like domingo is much better for anyone who wants to learn a language.
rosettastone,1,5,pp keeps telling me sign-in failed.
rosettastone,1,5,something went wrong.
rosettastone,1,5,"when i attempted to contact support, chat doesn work either."
rosettastone,1,1,i think it's useless.
rosettastone,1,1,it doesn't even teach you the alphabet.
rosettastone,1,1,"arabic grammar is probably the most complicated of all languages, yet no grammar, no vocabulary."
rosettastone,1,1,they just give you pictures and sentences written in arabic.
rosettastone,1,1,"no idea which word is the noon, profound, adjective or verb/adler!"
rosettastone,1,1,and i'm actually familiar with arabic as i've studied with another approach for over a year.
rosettastone,1,1,i just can't understand how anyone is supposed to learn this way.
rosettastone,1,2,special character password?
rosettastone,1,2,why in your right mind would you try to go your own way with criterion on password?
rosettastone,1,2,i want to use a special character so let me.
rosettastone,1,2,admit
rosettastone,1,1,i can't even log in.
rosettastone,1,1,give tried multiple times and it keeps saying something went wrong
rosettastone,1,1,awful!!!
rosettastone,1,1,the costume relation never answer my email for asking restore all purchase.
rosettastone,1,0,of its copyÌïÑÍ∏∞Ïù∏ÏãùÍ∏∞ translate the money was paid without consent.
rosettastone,1,0,"i've asked for a refund several times, and the answer is to ask for goose play, but goose is pushing each other to contact lotion."
rosettastone,1,0,i will not use the director.
rosettastone,1,0,please refund as soon as possible
rosettastone,1,0,why password cannot contains special charm?
rosettastone,1,0,does this make sense?
rosettastone,1,2,"application tried to remove money from my account without my knowledge, she wanted to pay 3 months of english even though i didn't even log in to create a profile on that application, so i do not recommend this application, beware of fraud"
rosettastone,1,1,pp is not opening i tried it on my phone as well as on my friend's phone but its not opening.
rosettastone,1,2,"check the price, don't purchase lessons via pp."
rosettastone,1,2,"look online first, it appears the sale prices don't translate to in pp prices."
rosettastone,1,1,"can't see the pictures, navigation not intuition."
rosettastone,1,1,please contact me to ensure i will not be charged for this.
rosettastone,1,24,the free version only gives you one lesson out of the hundreds they have in they language you want to learn.
rosettastone,1,24,"basically just an advertisement, and i don't have 50+ dollars to pay for the full version."
rosettastone,1,24,"go ahead and buy this if you have the money, it's a great pp, but if you thought it was free you are sadly mistaken."
rosettastone,1,24,not very fair to advertise as free.
rosettastone,1,161,this pp is the pinnacle of incompetent.
rosettastone,1,161,"for one, there's no option for a placement text for non-beginners."
rosettastone,1,161,"which wouldn't be a huge problem, if it wasn't for the fact that going through the lessons is so unnessacarily tedious because of the painless, slow-ass fade transitions and the decision to force you to listen to each entire sentence before answering."
rosettastone,1,161,"domingo is infinitely better, not to mention free."
rosettastone,1,2,"not even close to other apes such domingo and fluencia also hard to cancel, still trying"
rosettastone,1,0,same thing: only works while online.
rosettastone,1,0,what's the point: keeping people on a tight leash ?
rosettastone,1,10,"i have purchased roseola stone for my computer, and thought this would be a great supplement for when i am on the go."
rosettastone,1,10,hope.
rosettastone,1,10,"can only access one lesson, the rest you have to purchase."
rosettastone,1,10,"so after using it for one day, you cannot go on even with small or partial lessons."
rosettastone,1,10,very disappointed.
rosettastone,1,10,would be nice to have an additional phone pp for the customers who already wished out for the home program.
rosettastone,1,10,"i'm sure i would give it many more stars, if i could actually use the pp."
rosettastone,1,8,well...i got really excited when i saw that there is a roseola stone pp...even more excited when i got the all and my user into worked to link to my past p.c.
rosettastone,1,8,progress....did one lesson and now i have to buy more to clock?
rosettastone,1,8,how is it linked to the one i already bought but not enough that i can use it on the pp more than 1 lesson worth?
rosettastone,1,8,disappointing
rosettastone,1,21,it's horrible.
rosettastone,1,21,"i tried to use this pp to further my study in the japanese language, but it seems that there is no beginner course."
rosettastone,1,21,"i chose the lowest level course it has, but not not only did it start teaching me words from the beginning, those words were mainly written in anti, which i barely know anything about."
rosettastone,1,21,and it didn even give a translation either!
rosettastone,1,21,it just showed pictures.
rosettastone,1,21,pictures!!
rosettastone,1,21,how the hell am i supposed to figure out what the words that i can read with just pictures?
rosettastone,1,21,!
rosettastone,1,0,terrible.
rosettastone,1,0,my first lesson in japanese and it just rattled off entire sentences and asked me to pick the watching picture.
rosettastone,1,2,not working at all.
rosettastone,1,2,teach support hasn't responded either.
rosettastone,1,2,i want it to work or a full refund..
rosettastone,1,7,"so disappointed with this pp, you only get the first lesson set."
rosettastone,1,7,they make you repeat and guess phrases but with no context of what it means or what your saying.
rosettastone,1,7,not sure if this pp was meant to supplement another service.
rosettastone,1,7,such a shame for such a well established company.
rosettastone,1,28,as it concerns the pp as a learning tool is absolutely amazing .
rosettastone,1,28,as it concerns the manage subscription is a chaos.
rosettastone,1,28,the application says that the auto renewal is exercised by default.
rosettastone,1,28,if you want to change that there is the option to do it so.
rosettastone,1,28,unfortunately i tried to find this option but it doesn't exist!!
rosettastone,1,28,"send an email, waiting for a reply 2 days now!"
rosettastone,1,28,by the way i was paying through papal and i was charged anyway.
rosettastone,1,28,i don't know if the us friends face the same issue but here in e it's a mess.
rosettastone,1,1,terrible experience.
rosettastone,1,1,i bought the subscription without realizing i was working through the free section in unit 1. so i was paying for something that was free.
rosettastone,1,1,they wouldn't give me a refund.
rosettastone,1,208,mobile andros pp stopped working after 5 days.
rosettastone,1,208,their teach support has no idea why or how to fix the bug.
rosettastone,1,208,i paid $254.99 for this program.
rosettastone,1,208,getting a refund for their failed pp has been a nightmare of wasted time by repeating the same steps over and over by their teach support and roseola's teach support expecting a different outcome is beyond my understanding.
rosettastone,1,208,do not waste your money or time with this mobile andros pp.
rosettastone,1,16,horrible.
rosettastone,1,16,impossible to learn from.
rosettastone,1,16,the program has the student repeat a russian word or phrase and gives only a picture for the description.
rosettastone,1,16,but a picture is worth a thousand words.
rosettastone,1,16,there is too much ambiguity.
rosettastone,1,16,"even if you can repeat the word or phrase, you dont know what it means."
rosettastone,1,16,its way too fustrating.
rosettastone,1,16,thank god i didn spend a ton of money on this.
rosettastone,1,0,i would like to know how to subscribe on this pp.
rosettastone,1,0,my free trial days are going to finish..
rosettastone,1,1,yes it shows you how to say and speak it but it doesn't actually put the english in their to know what you're actually learning?
rosettastone,1,1,?
rosettastone,1,111,"when going over the pronunciation exercises, the pp does not hear me."
rosettastone,1,111,"when i say it louder, it says that the audit too loud."
rosettastone,1,111,this is really irritating and quite agitating.
rosettastone,1,111,"i paid for a lifetime membership yesterday, bit in really not pleased."
rosettastone,1,111,i want a refund........ i was able to troubleshoot the error.
rosettastone,1,111,"in willing to change my rating, i just have one question; since i have a lifetime membership, am i able to change the language i want to learn after i finish the whole lesson plan?"
rosettastone,1,39,i am a native chinese speaker and in september 2018 i bought the makarin version for my middle school aged daughter.
rosettastone,1,39,after 3 weeks.
rosettastone,1,39,she was so discouraged that she refuse to continue.
rosettastone,1,39,there was no explanation of grammar or rules at all.
rosettastone,1,39,and yet the sessions progressed fairly quickly which causes lots of confusion.
rosettastone,1,39,to make matter worse goose automatically renewed my subscription and the i had to make a dozen calls to goose and roseola stone requesting refund.
rosettastone,1,39,still waiting.
rosettastone,1,6,cancel your subscription immediately after download.
rosettastone,1,6,you can't get a refund after 24 hours even though it's a 3 day trial.
rosettastone,1,6,"first off, i selected russian."
rosettastone,1,6,"very first round is a picture of a boy and girl, both signaling hello and look to be both traveling with russian words on top and no english definition of what you're even saying."
rosettastone,1,6,i immediately stopped there.
rosettastone,1,6,i need to know the alphabet and letter pronunciation before anything.
rosettastone,1,271,"i often for the free trial, and they immediately charged my card $49."
rosettastone,1,271,i immediately canceled the subscription but did not get a refund!!
rosettastone,1,271,instead they will cancel it in december and keep my money!!
rosettastone,1,271,"i can comment on the actual value of the pp, because i feel slammed and will be using another subscription pp instead that gave me a day free trial ( and i am now happy to pay for) beware!!"
rosettastone,1,271,!
rosettastone,1,0,i want to like this pp so much but honestly how am i expected to learn a new language if you just tell me to say things with no explanations at all?
rosettastone,1,0,i get not using english but so far is has taught me nothing but random words with no real in-depth learning of the grammar.
rosettastone,1,0,i read the genetic reply but when people are telling you it's not working you should take that advice and alter the program.
rosettastone,1,4,roseola stone is an excellent tool to learn another language.
rosettastone,1,4,"i've purchased several courses in past years at considerable expense, but when i switched to mackbook pro for my computing needs i no longer had a built-in did to use the program so they sat unused."
rosettastone,1,4,"i'd hoped i could stream the languages i've paid for but no, i'd need to pay all over again."
rosettastone,1,4,disappointed profit imperative abandon customers who already paid for the same content.
rosettastone,1,3,"i pay for the 3 month plan and less than a month they blocked all the session that i paid for, customer service ain't no good either because then they try to tell me that i made that purchase on a phone a while ago when give been having a androind for a few years i don't recommend this pp at all"
rosettastone,1,30,"paid full price to have full access to the language learning lessons, but the subscription was not added to my account and i received error messages when trying to use the software."
rosettastone,1,30,i sent six email to the customer support and only received one reply asking for proof of purchase.
rosettastone,1,30,"i immediately replied with proof of purchase, and then no further email correspondence from roseola stone."
rosettastone,1,30,i finally looked up the us phone number for technical assistance and had to call 3 times.
rosettastone,1,30,only on the third call when i requested a refund was my issue was finally excavated and resolved in 30 minutes.
rosettastone,1,30,the subscription was added to my account.
rosettastone,1,30,a simple issue should not take so long and be so frustration to fix.
rosettastone,1,30,this took over a week and nearly an hour calling international.
rosettastone,1,30,good luck if you ever experience a real technical issue.
rosettastone,1,30,the customer support is terrible.
rosettastone,1,30,"they asked me questions like ""why did you buy it through the play store?"
rosettastone,1,30,"you should have bought it on our webster"" well the pp takes you to the play store to complete the purchase."
rosettastone,1,2,"does not support that in any capacity, neither learning or as interface language, so yeah, bought for that step daughter.... and she can't use it because its all in english, which she is trying to learn, and you can't change the interface language in the pp, you have to go to the webster to change it... get it together r.s."
rosettastone,1,2,this is pathetic.
rosettastone,1,2,must service was nice when i was concealing.
rosettastone,1,1,i recently purchased the life time subscription and it quits saying that my email is already in use.
rosettastone,1,1,what is going on with this pp.?
rosettastone,1,1,can i get a refund?
rosettastone,1,4,paid for a month of premium access and didn't get any access as if i'm still a free account.
rosettastone,1,4,"it says ""your payment is pending and you will clock this in a few minutes."""
rosettastone,1,4,this was weeks ago.
rosettastone,1,4,not only have i paid for nothing but i also no longer have an option to update.
rosettastone,1,30,the pronunciation exercises are really irritating.
rosettastone,1,30,i tried speaking into it but it never registers my audit.
rosettastone,1,30,at that point i just disabled it so i can get through the first course but it defeats the purpose.
rosettastone,1,30,i paid for 12 months front and it is not worth it.
rosettastone,1,30,i really want a refund.
rosettastone,1,0,does not pick up your voice very well.
rosettastone,1,0,i can be sitting in complete silence and it still doesn always pick up my voice.
rosettastone,1,3,does not pick up my microphone.
rosettastone,1,3,which makes this pp is useless.
rosettastone,1,3,i know it's not my phone because i'm using speech to text to write this review
rosettastone,1,1,the pp doesn't hear anything it freeze constantly and i spent over 200$.
rosettastone,1,1,i received a free language as well and wanted to use it but its painless considering i can't use the first language.
rosettastone,1,1,this was ridiculous i subscribed from their email listing like 3 times and still got email.
rosettastone,1,1,i tried to delete my account but i can find the option on the pp and i can find it through their webster.
rosettastone,1,14,"not a great way to learn, i can pronounce the words, but i have known idea what i'm saying, as all you get is a picture."
rosettastone,1,14,my partner is polish and she says i'll never learn anything this way.
rosettastone,1,14,"it's very repetition, so you'll learn how to say the words, problem is, you wont know what you are saying."
rosettastone,1,14,i've canceled my subscription after 4 months and i'll have to find another way
rosettastone,1,8,edit: latest version introduces display error.
rosettastone,1,8,i have speaking and listening focus.
rosettastone,1,8,in overview it shows me that there are 33 lessons per unit.
rosettastone,1,8,(but i'm the unit bottom it says 32 out of 32) please add dark mode.
rosettastone,1,8,"the pp is so white, learning at night is very tedious on the eyes."
rosettastone,1,8,:(
rosettastone,1,4,first very good then it doesn't work and nobody tell me why.
rosettastone,1,4,so here i am paying for a non-existing device with hardly any valid reaction from customer service.
rosettastone,1,4,quite frustration.
rosettastone,1,4,good product if it only would work.
rosettastone,1,35,very poor pp!
rosettastone,1,35,it double charged me and nobody took responsibility for that.
rosettastone,1,35,now they charged me again without giving me access to the material.
rosettastone,1,35,i believe there is a big bug in their transaction system.
rosettastone,1,35,i did not expect that from roseola stone.
rosettastone,1,2,concerned.
rosettastone,1,2,i was enjoying this pp but have been charged ¬£49 this month instead of ¬£4.90!
rosettastone,1,2,have sent 2 email with no response to either.
rosettastone,1,2,"i've been waiting for a refund of my money for almost 2 days, the pp wasn't what i expected, including by the fact that they retired all the money in my bank account for the annual subscription."
rosettastone,1,2,"something, that i didn't want."
rosettastone,1,1,purchased an online subscription for 12 months for latin and it won't even show up on the pp.
rosettastone,1,1,no motivation step or anything to direct me to my subscription.
rosettastone,1,1,just wasted money for nothing.
rosettastone,1,23,when trial version was canceled within time they applied a 3 months subscription without my knowledge.
rosettastone,1,23,with regards to the pp the voice recognition does not work.
rosettastone,1,23,you can make up any sounds and it says correct .
rosettastone,1,1,doesn't work in china and support was responsive.
rosettastone,1,1,still is.
rosettastone,1,6,you have to sound things out but it doesn't even pick up my voice.
rosettastone,1,6,when i'm doing it isn't noisy in my house so it should be able to pick up on my voice.
rosettastone,1,3,great pp but way too expensive.
rosettastone,1,3,i would definitely use it but the subscription is over prices and life time option sounds like a joke.
rosettastone,1,3,shame i'll try another pp that isn't going to rip me off
rosettastone,1,1,"unbearable buggy, slow pp"
rosettastone,1,0,"it's not opening,,, keeps closing the pp"
rosettastone,1,3,can't get them to repeat phrase and won't recognize my voice!!
rosettastone,1,3,very disappointed and very frustration!!
rosettastone,1,3,really bad pp!
rosettastone,1,0,"it's pretty expensive for me, make it free, put some adds, i'll never complain about it."
rosettastone,1,1,incredibly frustrated by this pp and getting nowhere with customer support.
rosettastone,1,1,save your $$ and use a different system.
rosettastone,1,0,pp keeps stating that my name or password are incorrect after resecting my password twice.
rosettastone,1,0,pp does work on my surface pro 6. any suggestions?
rosettastone,1,0,this is ridicule.
rosettastone,1,0,"i installed this pp free, but you should pay for each of plan."
rosettastone,1,1,"was wrapped by misleading ad for ""free"" trial."
rosettastone,1,1,they charged for 3 months even though i canceled immediately they kept my money.
rosettastone,1,1,they are crooked.
rosettastone,1,0,way too expensive... and misleading 10¬£ per month you can't do that.
rosettastone,1,0,with those prices you wont go far....
rosettastone,1,0,pp wont open.
rosettastone,1,0,can learn italian if the pp doesn open.
rosettastone,1,2,"""free"" version is painless."
rosettastone,1,2,if you want to use it then you have to pay.
rosettastone,1,0,don't working with palmar login
rosettastone,1,0,total garage.
rosettastone,1,0,much better free apes out there.
rosettastone,1,0,don't let them sucked you out of $60 like they did me.
rosettastone,1,0,outdated.
rosettastone,1,0,"when doing activities in certain units the activity has nothing in common with the unit, i can believe how much of a scar this is"
rosettastone,1,0,the phone version of your product seems to only offer five of the languages in only interested in learning japanese.
rosettastone,1,0,this is stupid!
rosettastone,1,0,i learn one and then when i am about to start the next one i forget what the last one was and so i would go to the last one again and again and again.
rosettastone,1,0,if you want to learn a new language this is not the pp for you.
rosettastone,1,0,"oh, unless you want to pay money."
rosettastone,1,0,just purchased the product two days ago for the online.
rosettastone,1,0,but the pp won't let me log in?
rosettastone,1,0,so i can only practice when i'm at home on my computer when i have time
rosettastone,1,0,this is terrible!
rosettastone,1,0,you have to pay to do it!
rosettastone,1,0,"i'm sure that the actual pp is good, but i'm not wasting my money."
rosettastone,1,2,the pp contains pop up asking you to give it a rating.
rosettastone,1,2,any pp with a pop up asking for a rating receive s a one star from me.
rosettastone,1,0,no active writing is possible when learning turkish... but that is the most important task!
rosettastone,1,0,privacy-molesting permission : ( try memories or another... always re-check permission on your apes periodically to discover creeping boundary-violations.
rosettastone,1,1,took three days to them finally activate my paid content!
rosettastone,1,1,"very slow support, no other option the waiting for email available."
rosettastone,1,1,chat does not work.
rosettastone,1,1,now i used the program.
rosettastone,1,1,"compared to other programs, it's not for total beginners in my opinion."
rosettastone,1,1,different learning approach without any native language translations.
rosettastone,1,1,for beginners it's very complicated and frustration.
rosettastone,1,1,a little bit like a human learn language as a baby.
rosettastone,1,1,"i'll continue using it, hopefully that concept is not to frustration."
rosettastone,1,1,and wrong!
rosettastone,1,0,"when you're to repeat word(s) that you have no clue as to what that spanish word(s) mean, but are expected to choose from the images that describe what you're saying?!?!"
rosettastone,1,0,and this is the beginners level?!
rosettastone,1,0,so how is the cracked can i choose the correct image to a word that i haven't the clue to it's meaning?
rosettastone,1,0,i purchased roseola stone to use on my computer.
rosettastone,1,0,"using the same account into for this pp, i have to purchase again."
rosettastone,1,0,i was charged for a full 6 months immediately upon signing up for roseola stone on what was supposed to be a monthly charge.
rosettastone,1,0,"the course was not a beginner course, in my opinion, as i requested."
rosettastone,1,0,"the words and short phrases were beyond beginner level, in my opinion."
rosettastone,1,0,and i guess my andros microphone was not suited to the pronunciation protocol of the roseola stone course.
rosettastone,1,0,"this pp is terrible for beginners learning organ , as a beginner you can not read very fast and the pp consistently asks you to repeat large phrases quickly."
rosettastone,1,0,i simply couldn't keep up.
rosettastone,1,0,"this pp is designed for less difficult languages, so therefore will not be great for difficult ones due to the rapid pace."
rosettastone,1,0,"i would suggest at the very least an option to work at a slower pace, however i am ensure how that will affect your immersion qualities."
rosettastone,1,0,so the best way i learn is from intuition and was wondering why i never tried this pp before when i found out i actually have.
rosettastone,1,0,months ago.
rosettastone,1,0,"turns out i still can't even login or create an account because it complains about my internet connection, when my signal is perfect."
rosettastone,1,1,"if you guns want money don't list this as a ""free"" pp... also reading through the reviews it takes at least 10 days for a refund when it took you guns seconds to take ponies from consumers ... sounds like you guns are lipping people off!"
rosettastone,1,1,one star for not being honest about purchases!!
rosettastone,1,1,!
rosettastone,1,0,"i liked this pp, its really useful for learning languages and i would love to rate it for 5 stars but all the time i need to sign in and it takes a long time for it cut all the time i'm getting ratification ""something went wrong""."
rosettastone,1,0,fix it please
rosettastone,1,0,getting prompted to review it about every 10 minutes- even after doing a review!!
rosettastone,1,0,!
rosettastone,1,0,pp installed but takes too long to load.
rosettastone,1,0,the pp is currently trying to teach me chinese by only speaking and and showing translations in chinese.
rosettastone,1,0,not sure how i'm supposed to learn anything when i don't know what i'm saying?
rosettastone,1,0,if you choose other they never add the languages or language that you want to learn and they only have like 10 languages for you to choose from
rosettastone,1,0,"impossible to understand, just trying to repeat foreign phrases with no understanding of the meaning of the alphabet."
rosettastone,1,0,i don't understand how i'm supposed to learn a language with this.
rosettastone,1,0,there's a spoken foreign language then a few pictures and you choose which picture the phrase was.
rosettastone,1,0,if you don't know the language how are you supposed to know what was said.
rosettastone,1,0,"sure, i can repeat it perfectly after hearing it, but i have no idea what i'm saying in the first place."
rosettastone,1,0,glad there was a trial and i didn't have to spend money to find out this is just a cash grab.
rosettastone,1,0,my experience wasn't all that great.
rosettastone,1,0,i chose to learn arabic.
rosettastone,1,0,the program will give you pictures and they will describe the picture using the language you want to learn.
rosettastone,1,0,but they dont show a text or relay in your language what they are describing.
rosettastone,1,0,so you have to guess what they are saying.
rosettastone,1,0,that in it self is what pushed me away from the entire pp.
rosettastone,1,0,my family member told me about domingo.
rosettastone,1,0,so that is the pp i will be trying next.
rosettastone,1,1,"impossible to cancel the ""tutoring"" online is utterly ridiculous."
rosettastone,1,1,you can not access the account page to cancel the automatic subscription renewal.
rosettastone,1,1,don't use this program!
rosettastone,1,1,i even tried to goose how to cancel and they must have paid to scrub the results and removed bad reviews.
rosettastone,1,1,passed consumer was the only one i could find and had multiple users complaining about the same issue i'm having.
rosettastone,1,0,the install is free but nothing else is.
rosettastone,1,0,i thought it was very misleading and deceptive to show an pp as free and then immediately try to charge people once they download.
rosettastone,1,0,it's ridiculous actually.
rosettastone,1,0,"there are plenty of free language apes, such as domingo, that are excellent apes and 100% free"
rosettastone,1,1,"when i first tried out ossea,, i made a passcode,,that unfortunately i couldn't remember,, at the time i didn't think it would be a problem until roseola quit working on my phone,,s 7 andros, my son said try and install, then reinstate,,big mistake,,anyway long story short,,the staff at roseola refused to believe me even though one of their own staff had verified that was what went wrong,after fighting with it for a couple of days,,i gave up i will never buy anything from them again"
rosettastone,1,13,considering the cost the lessons are rather bland and not very useful from a practical language usage.
rosettastone,1,13,i typically do not need to say most of the examples they use.
rosettastone,1,13,"and repeating ""how are you"" is useless."
rosettastone,1,13,i expected more for the cost and am very disappointed.
rosettastone,1,8,"the application looks good but it clashes constantly, and when the pp is office it's really buggy."
rosettastone,1,8,i have to spend 30 pounds only to test this application.
rosettastone,1,8,"i have a service for 3 month that i can not use, decently not the best purchase."
rosettastone,1,0,tried the free trial.
rosettastone,1,0,voice recognition is horrible...slow in processing and rarely indicated correct.
rosettastone,1,0,have used other applications and they have no problems recognizing my words.
rosettastone,1,0,i also take one on one lessons and my teacher even has no issues with how i pronounce words.
rosettastone,1,0,itchy.
rosettastone,1,0,not user friendly.
rosettastone,1,0,terrible pp.
rosettastone,1,0,don't waste time downloading just to never get or space back.
rosettastone,1,0,says there's a problem with the system.
rosettastone,1,0,whatever time and space u spend on this is painless and very wasteful
rosettastone,1,0,"the pp is great for learning, and i really anna learn more but when i press on purchase all lessons, the page for paying doesn't appear."
rosettastone,1,3,speech recognition is horrible.
rosettastone,1,3,i have roseola stone on my computer and it is perfectly fine.
rosettastone,1,3,the andros pp is trash by comparison and not worth the scene subscription cost.
rosettastone,1,3,i tried to use it during my morning commune and find that i rarely get a response from the pp when doing pronunciation.
rosettastone,1,3,you have to scream to get a response.
rosettastone,1,3,i've tried it on my phone as well and it's the same there.
rosettastone,1,3,"don't waste your money here, wait for a slickdeals sale and buy the pp version for a one-time fee."
rosettastone,1,0,"this pp is horrible on your phone, they made parts of it way too small and i don't even have vision problems."
rosettastone,1,0,worst is their business practice of quietly taking your money.
rosettastone,1,0,they will not remind you that your auto renewal is coming up and you certainly don't get an email when you're charged!
rosettastone,1,0,my credit card alert tapped me off or i would have had no clue until i was trying to figure out why my card bill was so high.
rosettastone,1,0,"so go with some other company, this one is way too shady."
rosettastone,1,0,horrible!!!!
rosettastone,1,0,doesn't help pronounce all words!!!
rosettastone,1,0,i had to use different resources to help me!
rosettastone,1,0,"plus, doesn't even help with bowels!"
rosettastone,1,0,"i cancel my subscription and said ""no refund are issued."""
rosettastone,1,0,"meaning, they are still going to charge me after i canceled!!!"
rosettastone,1,0,please just do yourself a favor and learn outside to learn language!!
rosettastone,1,0,!
rosettastone,1,5,the trial version was horrible.
rosettastone,1,5,it just kept shipping the lesson and moving on to the next and sometimes just solving the problem itself and moving on.
rosettastone,1,5,really frustration and i would have preferred all the tasks to have been speech recognition but only a few were and the rest were watching a picture to a word.
rosettastone,1,5,if the trial itself wont work properly then how can i have confidence in the real thing.
rosettastone,1,5,this is disappointing
rosettastone,1,1,the pp renew automatically.
rosettastone,1,1,"make sure that you want to renew, because they will debit the total amount of subscription, this pp is a trap."
rosettastone,1,0,awful way of learning a language.
rosettastone,1,0,"it doesn't inform you what what the equivalent is in your own native language, much of it is guess work using pick cards."
rosettastone,1,0,this is be very counter intuition as you often need to and or third guess.
rosettastone,1,0,"confusing, very."
rosettastone,1,0,customer service is not extent.
rosettastone,1,0,i wouldn't be at all surprised if this was managed by a root.
rosettastone,1,0,never had a response to my email.
rosettastone,1,0,couldn't cancel within 30 days as promised and couldn't get a refund.
rosettastone,1,0,i also can't cancel subscription
rosettastone,1,5,"the pp was great, brilliant for learning especially if you have experience already in what you're learning."
rosettastone,1,5,"but it updated 2 weeks ago and has since not worked, coming up with an error message whenever i click on a module."
rosettastone,1,5,i have contracted the support team twice with regards to it and they are yet to respond with anything more than an email giving me a case number.
rosettastone,1,5,professional and currently just bleeding my bank account for nothing.
rosettastone,1,0,pp is great as a learning tool.
rosettastone,1,0,"however, the experience takes a very deep nosedive when interrupted by a pop up after every lesson asking if i'm enjoying the pp."
rosettastone,1,0,well i was until this pop up.... now it's just annoying and distracting.
rosettastone,1,0,it continues to pop up even after i have submitted feedback and i can assure you that the continuous pop up will not make my experience better.
rosettastone,1,0,make it go away.
rosettastone,1,4,"it moves way too fast without breaking up how to say any words, and it is a horrible way to teach any language."
rosettastone,1,4,"it also is mostly asking for money anyway, so i would recommend to not waste your time, and get a better pp."
rosettastone,1,0,not my choice.
rosettastone,1,0,"-already chose the proficient level (maintain the language), but still shows me basic things."
rosettastone,1,0,"- come on guns, let your customers taste your product before telling them to pay for it, i can do anything, can learn anything, all you ask is ""payment plan""."
rosettastone,1,0,- look what 'memories' is doing.
rosettastone,1,1,"constant push modifications asking for money that you can't turn off, landscape view only."
rosettastone,1,1,"also, this is only possible if you start out knowing the language."
rosettastone,1,1,i tried a lesson of something i didn't know and it was impossible.
rosettastone,1,1,switched to something i did and it was ok for practice.
rosettastone,1,0,"they wanted me to disabled the microphone, i needed hear that i was pronouncing the words right, it was to be a free trial and they wanted a credit card."
rosettastone,1,0,sorry free is free not with a creditcard so i disabled rosettastne!
rosettastone,1,4,i tried the filipino language and was very disappointed.
rosettastone,1,4,i could not get a pass on the pronunciation exercises.
rosettastone,1,4,i have a good phone with a functional microphone and native filipino speakers have told me that i have good pronunciation for the few filipino phrases i know.
rosettastone,1,4,overall it was a very frustration experience.
rosettastone,1,4,i also question the 100% immersion approach for learning a second language.
rosettastone,1,4,"based on personal experience, i think a little translation mixed in is helpful."
rosettastone,1,0,avoid it!
rosettastone,1,0,disappointed with the quality of the pp(spanish - spain).
rosettastone,1,0,"sides load to fast not giving you ability to pause things and really understand, there are wrong word meanings which is a no no for a language leaving pp."
rosettastone,1,0,furthermore i got longed out of the pp suddenly and have to go through rustle to rest password and set it up again.
rosettastone,1,0,"i will keep it for few more days, but i will be asking for reimbursement of the money i paid for subscription as it is definitely not worth 50$!"
rosettastone,1,0,!
rosettastone,1,7,never spoke japanese but the very first lesson is not explaining anything.
rosettastone,1,7,everything i was taught was not translated back to english and there were no description pictures either so there no way of even knowing what i was saying.
rosettastone,1,7,plus the word match game was presented right away before i was ever taught anything about the spelling or the game.
rosettastone,1,7,more confused now than when i started.
rosettastone,1,7,also its not free
rosettastone,1,5,"i have a subscription with roseola stone and i'm very displeased with the content, its not telling me the meaning of the words and i feel like it chooses when it wants to hear, sometimes it hears me completely fine and a second later i'm speaking quite loud into it and it can't hear me."
rosettastone,1,0,i got the organ language and i didn't like how it didn't start with the basic letter and pronunciation.
rosettastone,1,0,it went straight to taking to me and asking what it said.
rosettastone,1,0,i learned more from getting library books.
rosettastone,1,0,i know it's a hard language therefore they should put more things so people can learn from beginning.
rosettastone,1,6,speech recognition is dead.
rosettastone,1,6,"this used to be a great pp, but forget passing any pronunciation tasks with it."
rosettastone,1,6,"been promised by teach support for last 5 months that they are ""aware of the issue and working diligently""."
rosettastone,1,6,"some magic update is supposed to fix it, but after several updated there is no difference."
rosettastone,1,31,if you're a beginner i wouldn't dare touch this.
rosettastone,1,31,who ever said this is the way to learn is terrible.
rosettastone,1,31,for me i'm advanced on the subject so the material just strengthen my knowledge.
rosettastone,1,31,for beginners even advanced i'd say no unless you have extra cash around and want to strengthen some minor points.. maybe.. i have no clue why this sold so much.
rosettastone,1,31,guessing the language isn't learning
rosettastone,1,0,do.
rosettastone,1,0,not buy.
rosettastone,1,0,"they say 30-day guaranteed refund, so i decide to buy the unlimited use japanese version on march and, but i quickly decide (the following day) to cancel it and get it refused, but, i can't!"
rosettastone,1,0,"because i bought it through goose play, i can't get a refund (i tried all the steps they provide, and nothing, goose keeps automatically denying my request)."
rosettastone,1,0,"if you hesitate with your purchase on goose play, you'll get sir*wed over."
rosettastone,1,0,do not buy!
rosettastone,1,0,!
rosettastone,1,1,signed up to the 3 day free trial.
rosettastone,1,1,figured it'd give me a chance to see if i got on with it then i could subscribe after next payday.
rosettastone,1,1,"2 hours after signing up, 29.99 gets pulled out of my bank even though i canceled as i was aware of auto renew after 3 days."
rosettastone,1,1,my play store pp is not letting me request a refund (option isn't there?).
rosettastone,1,1,"when i contracted roseola, they just gave me a link to their pp fads which had nothing to do with refund."
rosettastone,1,1,didn't care that my money has been taken for a free trial
rosettastone,1,0,so him trial with more then him of crashing had the best free experience and when i did use it it wouldn register my voice constantly say wrong then move on great trash pp rate do not download
rosettastone,1,0,when something is not free but advertised that way it can get frustration as listed as free
rosettastone,1,1,"it would've been a cool thing to use but have to pay for a lot of lessons, so i won't be using this"
rosettastone,1,144,a shame it doesn't recognise the multiple full languages courses attached to my account from desktop/windows software.
rosettastone,1,144,customer services told me the ¬£300 complete courses i bought previously aren't enough and i'm expected to pay the in-pp subscriptions despite the courses being the same content in different wrapping.
rosettastone,1,144,strange idea of what loyalty is.
rosettastone,1,144,"i'll pay a subscription, sure; to one of your competitors."
rosettastone,1,144,is is far from holding a monopoly these days.
rosettastone,1,6,signed me out and won't let me sign back in.
rosettastone,1,6,i have a paid subscription.
rosettastone,1,6,update.
rosettastone,1,6,"i'm now concealing my subscription after not being able to resolve the issue through customer support, but it's not giving me the option for a return if my funds."
rosettastone,1,6,i'll be contracting my bank tomorrow to have them reverse the payments.
rosettastone,1,26,i wanted to like this pp but it makes no sense.
rosettastone,1,26,it doesn't tell you what your saying.
rosettastone,1,26,my common sense got me through the first 2 sides but beyond that i had no clue.
rosettastone,1,26,"i no your going to reply wit dynamic immersion, i can watch the spanish channel for dynamic immersion for free."
rosettastone,1,26,i want to mo what i'm saying and what's being said not guess.
rosettastone,1,0,this pp is disappointing.
rosettastone,1,0,okay so first of all you have to pay for it to pretty much learn anything useful.
rosettastone,1,0,"although this pp does teach you new things, you still need to pay in order to get a good experience."
rosettastone,1,0,"if they had good content for people who are a little on the cheap side, then i would truly enjoy my experience."
rosettastone,1,35,"while i get the way you are trying to teach, you still need to add a translation or something to tell the user what they are learning, in the domo for japanese there's 1 question that has no rhyme or reason for why its structures the way it is, you literally have to guess, all 4 pictures it showed had nothing i could see to do with each other, and the fill in the blank it gave had no explanation why it went where it did."
rosettastone,1,35,least tell us what we are trying to learn so we don't get stuck.
rosettastone,1,0,the pp is ok but i had to guess the correct answer because it isn't explained what the actual meaning of it is.
rosettastone,1,0,it also sucks that you have to buy the other lessons like why :/
rosettastone,1,1,couldn't use the pp.
rosettastone,1,1,"it asked me to identify women and girls who had bodies that looked the same as men and boys, so impossible to make the correct distinction."
rosettastone,1,1,"also, it kept saying it couldn't hear me even when i was speaking directly into the microphone."
rosettastone,1,3,i love the pp and have subscribed to a 3 month purchase before.
rosettastone,1,3,i decided to renew it for a year and it still has me locked out of the subscription lessons even thought the transaction is in my bank account and on my goose play store subscriptions list.
rosettastone,1,3,i would like it to be fixed.
rosettastone,1,0,"on 11/4, i left the following 2-star review: ""maybe it's me, or maybe it's my phone, but the pp refuses to believe that i pronounce anything correctly."""
rosettastone,1,0,"on 11/6, roseola stone left the following reply: ""we apologize for any inconvenience."
rosettastone,1,0,please send us a feedback email via in-pp settings to follow up with you.
rosettastone,1,0,"open roseola stone, tap the menu (3 horizontal lines), settings, feedback."""
rosettastone,1,0,"for the record, immediately prior to posting my review on 11/4, i did send a detailed feedback email via the in-pp settings."
rosettastone,1,0,i have yet to receive a response from that feedback.
rosettastone,1,0,i have now lowered the rating to 1-star to reflect the poor customer service.
rosettastone,1,0,it would be wonderful if the company would actually allow a real trial sans the payment into.
rosettastone,1,0,they collected my personal information before i came to that part of the enrollment.
rosettastone,1,0,not nice!
rosettastone,1,0,i decided it's best to install for now and continue with domingo.
rosettastone,1,43,i was excited to start because i really wanted to learn to speak swedish and thought i'd give this a shot.
rosettastone,1,43,"but the pp has me saying things but it does not tell me exactly what i was saying, just pictures that i have to guess."
rosettastone,1,43,this is an inadequate way of learning.
rosettastone,1,43,i'm very upset with this.
rosettastone,1,43,definitely will not be purchasing the full version.
rosettastone,1,23,"the pp will ask if you are a beginner, intermediate or advanced, but you cannot open any intermediate lesson without buying them, so the only way to try the pp is to start with the very basis, 'hello and goodby'."
rosettastone,1,23,not buying without trying.
rosettastone,1,6,"only the application is free, but content is paid."
rosettastone,1,6,this should be clear in the description.
rosettastone,1,6,play store and apple pp store are to be blamed for allowing this.
rosettastone,1,6,"it wastes the user time ilstalling an application because of wrong, misleading or incomplete information."
rosettastone,1,3,i have access thou my local library but it only lets me do lesson 1 without a charge and the pricking is too steep for me.
rosettastone,1,3,seems helpful but without paid access its painless
rosettastone,1,7,okay this is really a disguised rip-off.
rosettastone,1,7,a bait and switch.
rosettastone,1,7,i do not recommend it for the price.
rosettastone,1,7,you think you're getting a lot for the money.
rosettastone,1,7,but you find out unlimited is limited real quick.
rosettastone,1,7,limited to try to get you to fork over more money.
rosettastone,1,0,there are plenty of other language learning apes out there that dont make you buy a full version after the first 3 lessons.
rosettastone,1,0,i strongly recommend domingo.
rosettastone,1,0,of makes learning fun by turning it into a sort of game where you compete against others.
rosettastone,1,4,the pp takes entirely too long to tell you if you pronounce the word or phrase correctly.
rosettastone,1,4,the pp is good if you only want to know the word but if you want to learn how to say the word use the desktop version.
rosettastone,1,0,pretty disappointing.
rosettastone,1,0,"i couldn't use the pp because it kept telling me it couldn't connect to the network because my phone wasn't connected, but it very clearly was indeed connected."
rosettastone,1,0,maybe i'll try again one day.
rosettastone,1,13,"the pp heard and accepted me say 'die fraud' even though i have not said a word (there's no background noise where i am either - even if there had been ,i highly doubt it would sound like properly pronounced german words )."
rosettastone,1,13,"additional ,i could not go back to actually say the word myself ."
rosettastone,1,13,waste of time and not at all what i expected from roseola stone  i'm really glad i checked out the basic version before subscribing .
rosettastone,1,13,uninstalling right now !
rosettastone,1,0,i download this to look at it.
rosettastone,1,0,since then i've gotten multiple spasm email a day from them.
rosettastone,1,0,i have subscribed three times and have you even tried to block their email address but they seem to keep getting through.
rosettastone,1,0,just leave me alone.
rosettastone,1,2,apes seems only great for beginners only and there is not test to evaluate your current skill and take you from there.
rosettastone,1,2,"looks great, but i don't want to start from scratch."
rosettastone,1,34,i want to give it 5 stars honestly it helped me learn spanish... but it also kept charging me $25 a month without my knowledge!
rosettastone,1,34,"what is even worse is they charge you before they say they will, my subscription was apparently supposed to renew on the with but i was charged a day early on the with and they refuse to refund anything."
rosettastone,1,34,do not pay for this pp!!!
rosettastone,1,34,this is essentially a scar :(
rosettastone,1,0,"not free, but does not state it up front, forces you to make an account giving away personal information before it fists the cost into you."
rosettastone,1,0,make the cost front and clear.
rosettastone,1,12,was good until i signed out.
rosettastone,1,12,the surname on the pp is not my email email.
rosettastone,1,12,it's a email i've never seen so now i can't sign back in!
rosettastone,1,12,why is it not my email account that i pay the subscription on?
rosettastone,1,12,i've remained but no reply as yet
rosettastone,1,0,unless you're willing to pay then you don't get much out of this.
rosettastone,1,0,it makes it incredibly hard for those younger with no income to use.
rosettastone,1,0,"so, i barely finished setting up the account before finding it was practically painless."
rosettastone,1,0,didn't run on my andros device.
rosettastone,1,0,what if i would have played in advance?
rosettastone,1,0,better fix this quick.
rosettastone,1,15,"learning first isn't possible with this pp, due to the speech recognition."
rosettastone,1,15,"i've had actual persian people try to get some of these to pass, and they cannot."
rosettastone,1,15,"i've tried multiple microphone, as well as the built in mid on my phone."
rosettastone,1,0,"great program, but the subscription and pp are impossible!"
rosettastone,1,0,keeps locking me out of the nodules.
rosettastone,1,0,"considering going back to domingo.. not quite as good of a language program, but for a free program, the user experience is way better!"
rosettastone,1,4,you need to fix the capability.
rosettastone,1,4,it's volume sensitive and there is no pitch control.
rosettastone,1,4,there is is no way of slowing down to hear the correct pronunciation.
rosettastone,1,1,funds were pulled from my account for a subscription that i did not authorize.
rosettastone,1,1,never actually used the pp outside of it's free capabilities (which were good).
rosettastone,1,1,remained support and hoping for a resolution.
rosettastone,1,2,"i purchased this product in the past and decided to use it again, once i got the mobile pp its telling me to purchase lessons that should already be paid for."
rosettastone,1,2,i sent feedback via email and instead of an answer to this crazy asking for more money i get some other add about buying more languages from them.. there are better methods that are not after your money.. use at your wallet own risk
rosettastone,1,148,i didn't understand what i paid money for.
rosettastone,1,148,the money was withdrawn from my account twice without any ratification and then they send me an email saying i will only be able to use my subscription for three more days.
rosettastone,1,148,i delete pp and i don't want to be charged anymore.
rosettastone,1,148,it's a scar.i already contracted their support.
rosettastone,1,148,nothing was done they just say they have a lot of inquiries now and i have to wait .
rosettastone,1,148,that's how they respect their customers.
rosettastone,1,148,i don't recommend this pp to anyone
rosettastone,1,0,no 1-month subscriptions.
rosettastone,1,0,lifetime price is way too expensive.
rosettastone,1,3,"i bought a full pack of levels 1-5 on cos, which mentions ""free online features"" (capitalization corresponds to the one on the box), but apparently i have to purchase online courses separately?"
rosettastone,1,3,!
rosettastone,1,0,speech recognition takes over 60 seconds to process what i've said.
rosettastone,1,0,on the easiest setting it marks what i say wrong even with simple words that i know that i'm pronouncing correctly.
rosettastone,1,2,i have never written a review on goose play before i think.
rosettastone,1,2,but i am being charged 30 europe and i can not activate this god awful virus of a software.
rosettastone,1,2,stop reaching me and tell me how to activate my account.
rosettastone,1,0,i dont like it because i put my e-mail and it said someone already put this e-mail try again
rosettastone,1,1,"i don't know what's happen, but when i want to sign up, it say my email have been used before."
rosettastone,1,1,"then, i try to sign in, and i can't too."
rosettastone,1,1,"but i never use this pp before, how can it say that my email have already used."
rosettastone,1,1,can you help me?
rosettastone,1,7,"i have paid the 6 month subscription, and it will not work in the pp."
rosettastone,1,7,"i reached out to customer support, to no avail."
rosettastone,1,7,"sadly, 1 star for poor functionality and customer service."
rosettastone,1,2,i've been trying to buy all lessons with the one time payment of $199.99 in the pp on andros goose playstore.
rosettastone,1,2,it decline my payment option consistently.
rosettastone,1,2,my payment option works just fine with other purchases in other apes.
rosettastone,1,2,please help.
rosettastone,1,2,i really want to start learning new languages.
rosettastone,1,0,no free lessons.
rosettastone,1,0,it appears that way at first but you cannot select first lesson without choosing a payment plan.
rosettastone,1,0,too bad.
rosettastone,1,0,i have heard allot about them and was curious about the program.
rosettastone,1,0,i hate it so much!
rosettastone,1,0,when i do a week in my plan i will get through some and the rest goes away and i lose everything first in learning second my screen went black three it takes me out and starts it again:( dont get the pp i wish i could give it -5 stars
rosettastone,1,1,"latest update takes my login and spine the wheel without stopping, or asks me to login again."
rosettastone,1,1,i played a two year subscription.
rosettastone,1,1,unable.
rosettastone,1,6,i am using roseola stone for my online language course at school.
rosettastone,1,6,i have tried the speech recognition on over three devices and it never recognized my voice.
rosettastone,1,0,this sucks!
rosettastone,1,0,"i would like to know what i'm saying means in english, not a stupid stock photo!"
rosettastone,1,0,and it doesn't even hear my voice in the practices!!
rosettastone,1,0,would not recommend!
rosettastone,1,0,it will not let me log in or make a free account i have tried everything and still won't work.
rosettastone,1,0,i know i have one because i have used it before and it says that there is a problem with the account.
rosettastone,1,0,expecting people to pay what can be free.
rosettastone,1,0,"jokes on you, your pp just got bootlegged and is now 100% free on the internet."
rosettastone,1,11,i had a 3 day trial on dec th and they charged me on the th which overgrown my account.
rosettastone,1,11,in highly disappointed because i have an email and everything stating i will be charged on the with.
rosettastone,1,11,never will try this pp again.
rosettastone,1,0,doesn't teach basic words just gives right in with 3 word phrases and pictures.
rosettastone,1,0,"needs to start out with the basic words such as, the, and, or etc"
rosettastone,1,0,wont let me cancel my subscription.
rosettastone,1,0,worthless!!!!
rosettastone,1,0,dont get it!!!
rosettastone,1,0,cancel my subscription!!!
rosettastone,1,0,add on they remained me back saying your subscription has been canceled and charged me again the next month.
rosettastone,1,4,do not buy this learning software!
rosettastone,1,4,go with rabble.
rosettastone,1,4,i talked to an agent prior to buying i bought the cos and explained i wanted mobile and home use of the cos. i was told that you then have to pay again for their online service to use your purchased expensive language cos on a mobile device!
rosettastone,1,4,absolutely a waste of money!
rosettastone,1,4,the cos will not work at all on a chromebook as well.
rosettastone,1,4,i will make sure to tell everyone i know to not use this product!
rosettastone,1,0,does not recognize my voice.
rosettastone,1,0,even if i shout.
rosettastone,1,0,"i have tried adjusting settings, to no avail."
rosettastone,1,2,was working great for one day but now errors when loading lessons.
rosettastone,1,2,connected on phone and lesson worked perfectly.
rosettastone,1,2,please fix andros version.
rosettastone,1,0,horrible for beginners.
rosettastone,1,0,it gives you pictures and you have to guess what they are saying what the picture is before you even learn the words.
rosettastone,1,0,makes you create accounts before you can even tell how much they charge.
rosettastone,1,0,horrible!
rosettastone,1,0,i tried someone's copy - cards method works better anyway.
rosettastone,1,0,this is totally mismanaged and trash.
rosettastone,1,0,it's all advertisements and keep asking for payment/money for nearly every click.
rosettastone,1,0,awful!
rosettastone,1,0,"pp is too expensive, using goose translator is better"
rosettastone,1,0,"you ask for all my information, then tell me there is a 3 day trial but i have to agree to pay the full year first."
rosettastone,1,0,no!
rosettastone,1,0,"you should give at least a week free trial, and then i can think about buying it."
rosettastone,1,2,i went to subscribe to the six month option 11.99 a month for six months and it took the entire payment of 69.99 i think that is false advertising and i won't be doing anymore business with this pp
rosettastone,1,1,this pp sucks.
rosettastone,1,1,"you can do the first few lessons for free, but after that you have to pay for a subscription, which is super expensive."
rosettastone,1,1,don't install unless you plan on spending a ton of money.
rosettastone,1,0,the speaking exercises are a nightmare.
rosettastone,1,0,i don't think it's a problem with my microphone.
rosettastone,1,0,this means it has to be the pp.
rosettastone,1,0,"i can't help but be really confused it's making me say long sentences out loud on the first day with barely any practice, and it's driving me insane how many times i have to try."
rosettastone,1,3,"i can't start core lesson in chinese language for some reason it gives me an error message, kindly see to it because i just subscribed for 3 months."
rosettastone,1,0,money hungry.
rosettastone,1,0,the company wont give you the mobile languages even though i purchased the desktop versions.
rosettastone,1,0,"so this pp wants me to spend around 1,000 dollars so i can practice both on my desktop and on mobile?"
rosettastone,1,0,that is ridiculous.
rosettastone,1,0,i don't know how good it is.
rosettastone,1,0,i am annoyed that it doesn't tell the price.
rosettastone,1,0,i am not signing up for a trial that auto renew in 2 days without knowing the price.
rosettastone,1,0,waste of my money for a 3 months access for $50 when all i get is few core lessons or force to go full access for extra $100-200 so disappointed from this waste of my money and time for basic free trial lessons (but for $50)
rosettastone,1,2,if you use the free trial be sure to cancel.
rosettastone,1,2,after 3 days it will automatically charge you $95 without asking.
rosettastone,1,0,"i bought the full package for ¬£299.00 and now they switch to ""online service"" and i cannot use it here."
rosettastone,1,1,it should tell you it's not free (94$) and takes a credit card just to do a 3 day trial before you download it.
rosettastone,1,25,"just terrible, i was only expecting a monthly payment of 7.99 a month instead of paying the full annual amount of 94.99 up front, nothing was specified and i lost money because of it"
rosettastone,1,4,awful pp.
rosettastone,1,4,when i tried a trial period which was suggested in this pp it took money from my goose account.
rosettastone,1,4,its first time when i get in such strange circumstances while using a trial access in education pp.
rosettastone,1,5,the learning is excellent.
rosettastone,1,5,"the pp is poorly maid , it clashes , if you have bad internet it work very slow even though i download the topics for office use the pp need improvements"
rosettastone,1,25,have to sign in to use.
rosettastone,1,25,can't even check pp out.
rosettastone,1,25,was also told you have to pay up to $200 per language.
rosettastone,1,25,i can easily learn any language i want from other sources for free.
rosettastone,1,2,i signed in and the next thing i knew i was on a 3 day trial then paying 50 odd quid.
rosettastone,1,2,i didn't click anything and there's no option to cancel.
rosettastone,1,2,i shall be pursuing a full refund.
rosettastone,1,2,rip off
rosettastone,1,0,unless you buy the premium you only get 30 mind of content save your money download domingo
rosettastone,1,0,"there is no my account section, how i cancel this account, i dont want to continue using this pp.i already install it."
rosettastone,1,0,"because after trial it said that i would be charge, but i search where to cancel this pp but not found also my account section dont have as i read in goose to go to the my account section in order to cancel using the account and ask to paid."
rosettastone,1,0,"it doesn't really state what the word means in english, like it's telling me all these different drinks but i don't know if it's naming a specific one."
rosettastone,1,4,"it's only useful if the speech recognition elements aren't used, at all."
rosettastone,1,0,had this a week and bombarded by sales offers several times a day so meeting it
rosettastone,1,160,"they take you money, then don't provide the product."
rosettastone,1,160,"when you cancel your subscription apparently they keep charging you ""in house,"" so if you e or join again they claim the you own money!"
rosettastone,1,160,"when you verify that you canceled, they tell you that you have to ""cancel directly with them,"" if you cancel via goose subscriptions, it isn't good enough!"
rosettastone,1,160,"i don't care how good the program may be, it's not worth being taken for."
rosettastone,1,160,"i paid $250 tonight, and have nothing to show for it!"
rosettastone,1,160,be careful!!!
rosettastone,1,160,!
rosettastone,1,6,"it want let me start day 3. it consistently shows "" come back tomorrow""."
rosettastone,1,6,doesn't work smoothly and it just want you to subscribe.
rosettastone,1,0,have to pay for it to be able to do anything unless you want to learn the basic things you learn in elementary school.
rosettastone,1,0,i wish these apes would disclose this before wasting my time downloading it and providing my email address.
rosettastone,1,0,it is a play to farm peoples information.
rosettastone,1,4,never could get the voice phases to work properly.
rosettastone,1,4,"several attempts, all failures."
rosettastone,1,1,horrible.
rosettastone,1,1,30 seconds in (japanese) & it's already on level 100 difficulty.
rosettastone,1,16,i signed up for the free trial advertised in the description and was instantly charged.
rosettastone,1,16,this is unacceptable and needs to he rectified.
rosettastone,1,0,i called 2 months ago to end my service subscription because the pp won't let me under manage subscription.
rosettastone,1,0,i dont use it anymore and they are still charging me.
rosettastone,1,36,very bad.
rosettastone,1,36,your payment process is frustration.you deduce money from account but do not upgrade plan.
rosettastone,1,36,also you don't reply to complaints.
rosettastone,1,0,the pp was not to bad but when i try to cancel my subscription goose play freeze.
rosettastone,1,0,so i have no clue how to cancel it.
rosettastone,1,0,"yet another booooring subscription pp from greedy developer, that don't bother to explain clearly that this is a subscription pp, before installing."
rosettastone,1,1,"the pp looks pretty good, but as i want to learn rumania it's no use, as it won't let me submit the language request form, which seems a big part of the pp to me"
rosettastone,1,0,"awful was a free trial membership that couldn't get off the free trial membership screen online help was no help go with do lingo, they stand by their product and it's free"
rosettastone,1,2,don't download this pp if you are an english speaker looking to learn first.
rosettastone,1,2,"unlike every single free pp i've used, this pp only provides words in first script.. there is no english alphabet entering to help with pronunciation eg ""salem"" for ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ."
rosettastone,1,2,from course one you are asked to repeat long sentences.
rosettastone,1,2,"if you can't read first, you have to do this purely by audit (listening+repeating) which for many earners isn't possible."
rosettastone,1,2,i've never been so upset about wasting my money on a subscription.
rosettastone,1,20,"hard to get into on filling, contact into etc."
rosettastone,1,20,not happy with the wall around the company.
rosettastone,1,20,can not delete card into etc.
rosettastone,1,20,even after concealing
rosettastone,1,8,it's not free so couldn't even give it a try.
rosettastone,1,8,"not giving my credit card for a ""free trial"" just to see if it even works."
rosettastone,1,0,i like it at first but then it stopped working so i delete it but it has been over a month and i get 3 or more email a day
rosettastone,1,1,download and found that it's totally a paid pp.
rosettastone,1,1,you can't give it a try without paying.
rosettastone,1,5,"in the beginning it was unable, but after a while it stop sanctioning"
rosettastone,1,0,the microphone part doesn't work at all
rosettastone,1,0,this pp does not work i tried so many times and it won't work üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üòí
rosettastone,1,0,this pp is good in terms of teaching.
rosettastone,1,0,but it makes you buy 76/80 lessons.
rosettastone,1,0,only the first 4 are free.
rosettastone,1,3,i just updated this pp and now i can not use it and i paid for a six month subscription it's just to bad i can't get this resolved
rosettastone,1,0,i'm trying to dear organ for a trip and this was a huge waste of money.
rosettastone,1,0,there were no basis to the alphabet.
rosettastone,1,0,it's like playing russian bullet because it simply throws you into full sentence structure.
rosettastone,1,0,absolute waste of money.
rosettastone,1,0,domingo free pp does a better job...
rosettastone,1,0,it doesn't even work.
rosettastone,1,0,when it gives you words you dont know what it means and there are so many adds
rosettastone,1,0,this pp is too expensive.
rosettastone,1,0,there are many free and good apes on goose play.
rosettastone,1,1,didn work for me.
rosettastone,1,1,"might work for the group of people that learn languages this way, but not for the others."
rosettastone,1,0,created an account but was never able to sign in.
rosettastone,1,0,kept saying invalid but upon creating a new account it said already had an account
rosettastone,1,0,"hello, my subscription renewed when i had no intention to, please refund, thank you."
rosettastone,1,0,could not see text in lower second line of pictures.
rosettastone,1,0,offscreen.
rosettastone,1,0,installed.
rosettastone,1,0,just installed the pp and then installed immediately because it runs only on horizontal mode.
rosettastone,1,0,my phone is note.
rosettastone,1,2,this is actual garage.
rosettastone,1,2,wasn't registering my voice correctly so i got a friend who was born in italy and speaks client italian to speak for me and it kept saying the pronunciation was wrong.
rosettastone,1,2,absolute waste of time and money
rosettastone,1,0,can't restore purchase for my account
rosettastone,1,1,please fix.
rosettastone,1,1,i speak client spanish but the pp doesn seem to pick up my voice or thinks in pronouncing it wrong.
rosettastone,1,1,plus there been times where ill purposely pronounce words wrong and it'll take it as the answer.
rosettastone,1,1,this is so distressful and it shouldn't be
rosettastone,1,6,it's a terrible pp it's very difficult trying understand what the words are actually referring to when it doesn't tell you in your native language i can even figure out if i'm using it correctly
rosettastone,1,21,no month to month subscription ties you into a minimum of an year.
rosettastone,1,21,no thanks.
rosettastone,1,0,"this pp full puchasable even not tell basic so dont download it feedback to this pp i was finding educational pp for 1 to 12 st firstly download your pp that is not relevant to me now i'm using ""martha book pp"" it is good pp recommended"
rosettastone,1,4,the pp does not show the translations in english like it says it does and there is no support
rosettastone,1,0,only 3 day trial and goose account gets killed after that.
rosettastone,1,0,false advertisement.
rosettastone,1,4,terrible experience .
rosettastone,1,4,it's not the right way for a beginner to learn .
rosettastone,1,4,you can't just say a word over and over and have it written in japanese .
rosettastone,1,4,.
rosettastone,1,4,"if  i go to japan and someone  speaks louder and slower , would it make me understand ?"
rosettastone,1,4,or what if they were to point to a sign or some  text .
rosettastone,1,4,would i catch what they are saying ?
rosettastone,1,4,.
rosettastone,1,4,now in japanese ... i hope i get this right.
rosettastone,1,4,.
rosettastone,1,4,"„ÅÑÂàóly„Å¢d„Çì„ÅÖ„Åë„ÅÆ„Å™„ÅÑ„Çì„ÉÜ„Ç£ „ÅÇp„ÅÉcË°ÄÈü≥„ÄÇ‰Ωç ÁßÅ Âêë„Åë„Å´„Å´ „Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ of„ÄÇ Èõ®„ÅåÈôç„Çã t„Çä„ÅàÔΩÑÔºéÁ±≥ Â∞æ„ÄÇ it says , i think its time to stitch apes ."
rosettastone,1,0,everyone having a d course paid motivation code should be able to create an account and continue to learn using the pp
rosettastone,1,1,it was advertised as a free trial but then i was charged the full fee.
rosettastone,1,1,i would like a refund.
rosettastone,1,0,"i chose to learn russian, i got a word, had to say it best i could, and depending on how well i say it, i would pass."
rosettastone,1,0,but it doesn't say what the word means or anything
rosettastone,1,0,after installing and time.
rosettastone,1,0,pp is still facing issue.
rosettastone,1,4,it keeps sending me there as even when i have the pp do not get this pp instead of this pp get domingo
rosettastone,1,0,this pp is not installing it percentage goes to 98 and then again start from 1% all the time it is installing useless pp
rosettastone,1,8,this pp doesn help me try to learn the language i'm trying.
rosettastone,1,8,it doesn let us know what were saying in our original language so i dont know what i am saying.
rosettastone,1,8,there are a few stitches as well.
rosettastone,1,8,if this meant get fixed i wont be able to talk to my grand.
rosettastone,1,8,she speaks a different language do i can understand a word she us saying.
rosettastone,1,0,"constantly loses network, unclean what to do even in the first lesson, stupid exercises"
rosettastone,1,0,zero quality and too expensive
rosettastone,1,0,this pp useful for languages which you know even on intermediate level.
rosettastone,1,0,it says its free and you still need to pay!!
rosettastone,1,0,üò°üò°üò°üëø worst pp ever!!
rosettastone,1,0,dont try only if you anna waist your money.
rosettastone,1,1,i have started the trial period and before it got over i lost k from my bank account and i registered the pp.
rosettastone,1,1,still i have not got back the money.
rosettastone,1,1,also your pp was not working properly on my phone.
rosettastone,1,1,fore which i have commented before.
rosettastone,1,1,please contact me.
rosettastone,1,7,you can't use an motivation code on mobile anywhere i can find and even when you buy a lifetime of a language be careful what device you pick.
rosettastone,1,0,do not spend you money.
rosettastone,1,0,there are better free tools available like domingo.
rosettastone,1,3,i download this .and created an account first time ever .and it says somebody is using this email address try again .my email is a custom email address nobody in the world has this email .so this is why i delete you.
rosettastone,1,3,keep up the great job roseola stone
rosettastone,1,3,waste of time.
rosettastone,1,3,you can play it for 3 days and after that you have to pay... education should be free.
rosettastone,1,3,help the world become a better place stop being greedy and taking peoples money for your wealth.
rosettastone,1,3,you can easily make this a free pp with donations like thousands of other apes and sites
rosettastone,1,0,do not download!
rosettastone,1,0,they say you get a free trial for 3 days and then charge you nearly $100 the next day!
rosettastone,1,0,its good for learning but unless u want to get 4 email a day or paying for a membership i recommend not getting it
rosettastone,1,0,did not like this pp.
rosettastone,1,0,very expensive and does not explain the translation
rosettastone,1,0,i'm trying to pay on the phone but it's not possible... please fix it !
rosettastone,1,4,was charged for 3 months when i tried to sign up for 3 day trial.
rosettastone,1,4,will be asking for my money back!
rosettastone,1,0,scar!
rosettastone,1,0,strongly advise you not to download this.
rosettastone,1,0,"you get one free 30 minute lesson, then have to pay for the rest."
rosettastone,1,0,complete scar
rosettastone,1,101,when i purchased roseola stone i believed that the program would be teaching me how to learn to speak first (persian).
rosettastone,1,101,i have not been able to do one lesson because this program only gives you pictures and then words in first.
rosettastone,1,101,"since i do not know how to read or understand the words that are being said/written, i am disappointed that this pp is only helpful if you already know some of the language."
rosettastone,1,101,i had to buy a new program and now i am stuck trying to get a refund on this pp.
rosettastone,1,0,"after more than a year how i paid everything and how i'm not using this application, they charged me for something again."
rosettastone,1,1,it would be a much better pp if it showed translations
rosettastone,1,0,it immediately tries to rope you into a 3 day free then automatic filling!
rosettastone,1,0,i think roseola stone is a waste of time and they repeat and cycle the same things they teach roman and that's not really helpful and they don't explain any type of grammar or sentence structure so roseola stone is just really not that helpful and it just takes your money it's such a waste
rosettastone,1,0,pp doesn't work anymore on chromebook.
rosettastone,1,0,worthless!
rosettastone,1,2,opened this pp to take a look and it asked for an account login or creation with no way to skin or not use one before letting me even try any of the lessons.
rosettastone,1,0,the pp does't take my email dress for the account - no option to assure the dress.
rosettastone,1,0,it's so confusing and stupid you should make it to where it is less stupid and less confusing.
rosettastone,1,0,i just download it to see what this pp is about.
rosettastone,1,0,then they took my money which i never agreeing on purchasing.
rosettastone,1,6,i spent $200 on the unlimited version a few months ago and now it says i need to buy it again to get full access?
rosettastone,1,6,?
rosettastone,1,0,this pp is awful.
rosettastone,1,0,it would tell me to say something and i would but it never told me what i was saying!!!
rosettastone,1,0,that why i always failed the tests it would give because i didn know what i was doing!
rosettastone,1,0,not a free pp!
rosettastone,1,0,if you want to get past day 3 you have to pay!
rosettastone,1,1,i would have liked to see it say something about it only offering a 3 day trial before i download this pp
rosettastone,1,4,so disappointing that this pp does not offer at least one african language option.
rosettastone,1,4,swahili is a language spoken widely throughout africa and this is not an option available on the pp.
rosettastone,1,0,worst thing i ever did was unload this pp.
rosettastone,1,0,pay to learn and endless email that keep coming in even after i asked politely to stop.
rosettastone,1,0,respect is a lost art.
rosettastone,1,0,you get a free trial period but you have to make a subscription to it.
rosettastone,1,2,i have no money to pay for some stupid pp!
rosettastone,1,2,this is the pricking worst pp i have ever download in my life and i have download millions of apes üò§ this pp should be delete and blocked for good that how bad it sucks!
rosettastone,1,2,they are just money thirsty so i would recovered never ever in my life to download this stupid pp!

rosettastone,1,13,they have been remained 3 x with the receipt and order # yet do nothing scar reported.
rosettastone,1,6,"have to create an account to use the pp, dont even know how well the pp work yet, wasted time"
rosettastone,1,8,i got the pp because i thought i would be able to use it with my pp lessons.
rosettastone,1,8,these people are crazy.
rosettastone,1,8,they want me to buy lessons to clock the rest.
rosettastone,1,8,i have already paid for is when it was $500.
rosettastone,1,8,there is no way in h*ll that i'm going to give them another $200 just to be able to use this pp.
rosettastone,1,0,very expensive when it says free an check that.
rosettastone,1,0,"it is terrible, it charged me for a subscription i did not make"
rosettastone,1,0,in a little kid and this is not good.
rosettastone,1,0,most of it is to put the sentence in the correct place it doesn't let you say anything just a little bit
rosettastone,1,3,it might be a good pp although... there are plenty good ones for free ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
rosettastone,1,1,"i would give it 5 stars but it keeps asking me to rate it even after i did, it's annoying!!!!"
rosettastone,1,1,please fix.
rosettastone,1,4,wanted to try the free trial clicked it but now i have been charged i don't know what to do.
rosettastone,1,4,wanted to try the pp before paying.
rosettastone,1,22,"don't download this pp, this pp really does not teach, for example i know spanish basic, but in lesson one, i cannot understand one sentence, what do you want to learn, ""he runs"" with a picture man run?"
rosettastone,1,22,"we need translation, we need know what's mean in our language."
rosettastone,1,22,"this pp can just learn present simple with subject and verb, and things with pictures, also i want delete my account, how can i delete my account?"
rosettastone,1,0,i wanted to download this cut i've heard such good things about it i live with people speak french as i was trying it wanted me to pay
rosettastone,1,0,verbal is off on the phone.
rosettastone,1,0,i have it on my computer and that this would be good too.
rosettastone,1,0,its not
rosettastone,1,0,it would be nice if they told you that you have to give them a credit card number in the description.
rosettastone,1,0,go.ahead and give me the usual response you give everyone else that gave you 1 star.
rosettastone,1,0,one of the best apes to improve my skill
rosettastone,1,0,ok i'd learn how to pronounce things.. but how do i know what are you talking.i mean how can i understand it when you won't provide the translation!
rosettastone,1,0,sorry but not as i expected.
rosettastone,1,0,uninstalling
rosettastone,1,0,it was an pp so for once i thought it would be free longer then 3 days but it was not so i took pp off
rosettastone,1,0,"installed by a rip off ""prize"" web page."

rosettastone,1,4,"you can't tell me nothing, this product is perfect."
rosettastone,1,4,"if you find anything wrong with it, it must be something you're doing wrong."
