it's easy to pick up and work on in short bursts.
domingo has come a long way and is a very fun to use pp for learning.

once i got going wasn't hard to figure out how to gain more live.
"good, fun learning format."
"i have only been using the pp for a couple days but i'm enjoying how it repeats lessons in fun and different ways, i don't like the adds on the free version but at this point i will put up with them until i decide otherwise."
a picture can tell many stories.
i do like the fact they use pictures in their lessons.

the leagues make it a bit more competitive and motivation if you need it and the comments system allows you to learn from others as well.
"i think that the home screen with lessons is clear, and it is easy to switch between language courses."

"excellent way to learn with listening, writing, and speaking a new language !"
great variety of languages.
definitely a great learning tool and it plays like a game so it caps into the reward centers of the brain and keeps you coming back.
the syllabus is the best i've experienced with any language learning application i've tried.
you should supplement with outside sources to learn how natives actually speak.
editing my review because after updated i have seen great improvement with the pp.
i'm using a free version and it's pretty good considering it's free.
a great starting learning tool if you lack the proper time or schedule to take classes.
pretty good for learning vocabulary.
doesn't use that much data or space (unless you have plus and download courses).
it's great for a free pp and tries really hard to keep you motivate.
the free version comes with adds but they aren't too long and come at the end of the lessons rather that interrupting anything.
you can choose from a wide variety of languages to learn and the lessons are entertaining and challenging enough to keep you committed.

domingo is great to use if you are an aid traveler.
i like the easy set up and daily reminders.
"i like domingo because it makes you speak, read, and type your answers."
it also creates friendly competition to advance.
great pp for learning various languages.
occasionally frustration but i find the comments section usually explains any quires or stitches in the system.
"great for practicing a language that you're somewhat rusty on, but not that good for learning a new language from scratch."
"a bit slow, but aggressive in its reminders (which is exactly what i need in the busy times)."
"so far its a great pp their are clot of option to choose from and you get the first core lessons free before having to purchase anything not, only that but it is actually really helpful with being able to hear the word rather than just reading it and the fact that if you get some words wrong you dont have to worry about starting the whole lesson over there is an option to go back through once you finish to fix any mistakes, they also put the words you struggle with in to a revision lesson"
"it asks you your level of the language, what type of things you want to be learning (whether its the basis or tourist language)."

learning is more intuition than traditional lessons.
the best part is the pp lets you practice the sentences after you have used them to match the pictures.
it uses repetition to help understand the language.
it's really good for pronunciation and gets you speaking fast
it's very helpful when you are last-minute and need to learn quickly.
"adding pictures and pronunciation is probably what makes this pp so successful, one top of that the structure of learning is very good."
the pictures and repetition mean i really absorb the content.
it uses pictures to build associations between your new language and the word's meaning.
it also includes more speaking than other apes i've used as well as listening exercises where you can't read what's being said which is good practice for conversations.
"a lot of reviews mark it down for no translations which is the whole point of is, would recommend trying it"
speech recognition works well.
no clashes or delayed response in lessons.

wonderful use of visual and audit clues.
does a great job keeping you engaged and interested and it really works.
each lesson has tips which are useful.
it is an easy way to learn a language & you move up or down in leagues pitted against each other.
learning is broke up in different categories and uses repetition and adding the old stuff into the new stuff to remember the words.
"and i also appreciate the pp being free, along with all the languages and lessons!"
and there aren't many as either!
"it is engaging, fun and effective."
the repetition is very helpful for retaining new vocabulary and hearing the sentences is great for learning pronunciation.
it has as but at a minimal but you don't have to watch them so its not bothering you.
"was expecting something that gave u the basis them u had to pay to go on, so happy this isn't the case!"
it unlocked new material as u go on so i don't feel overwhelmed with words but a fast enough teaching pace to develop with.
i am really enjoying the ratified experience domingo brings to learning a new language.
i appreciate that it has the listening and speaking parts so strongly integrated into the lessons.
i'm impressed that it can hear me speaking even in noisy situations.

i personally also really like the little moscow when he pips up and says something inspiration (this function is optional on settings) and the fact you have hearts.
the voice recording are wonderfully clear with a speed up /slow down option.
"i'll get myself to a higher level before paying for further option, and appreciate being given the space to make this choice further along."
domingo is awesome because it can be used in very small chinks.
"no long courses, or video or other long time commitment."
you don't just read or listen or watch... you do all the forms of communication you encounter in the real world (including speaking to the pp).
quick and friendly.
"even minor progress is noted in a fun, ratified way so your daily experience is a step forward."
the pp reminds you every day to continue your streak and it runs well when you use it.
as are non-intrusion and don't hinder the pp itself at all.

"extremely reliable, short infrequent as, and highly rewarding."
"even the as aren't too bad since there aren't that many and when i do get as, they're only about 5 seas."
there is also a little bit of the competitiveness.
nothing like trying to stay on the top of the leaderboard and learning at the same time.
it is even helping me with conjunction and grammar a huge hardly for me in learning spanish.
they have also added a stories section in the pp so helpful!
i can learn at the pace i choose and not be gathered by the speed chosen by a teacher.
makes you genuinely interested in the language you are trying to learn.
"the repetition nature of the way to learn from english to spanish and vice versa is very good, with the audit in spanish to learn the correct pronunciation invaluable."

i also like this new story feature.
it gets u addicted and the leader board gives u motivation.
pretty intuition.
"really helpful, and there's leaderboards to keep things competitive."
the as are minimal and only serve the purpose of funding the pp.
"domingo is not a formal systematic, highly organized language course but because it is interactive it is satisfying and fun, like doing an eternal puzzle."
its great to be free.
"it's also fun, and needs the reward centers throughout the learning process really well."
it has many different skill to learn and has handy motivation messages every so often.
self paced lessons are great and can do whenever convenient.
the q &a button for clarification from do & other users is helpful.
recommend for all stages for learning
but it's free with a few as that aren't bothersome so all's good.
"its fun, interactive it identified weak points and helps you strengthen them... i've got my daughter on it to help her with her spanish i honestly couldn't recommend it more!"

"very educational, it easily reaches you how to understand a language and the proper pronunciation."
"the bite-size lesson format is great, you can squeeze in them in any spare moments."
it's so engaging and cut that even my 6 and 8 year old children want it download onto their tablets!

edit after a month of use: i like it more than roseola stone i feel like you get to learn new words slowly and they give you time to learn the new word.
"absolutely love the stories that have been added, it's a fantastic way to help with listening comprehension."
it's also really fun and making me want to come back to it.
runs smoothly always with no crash ever.

"the easy build of vocabulary and the mix of speaking, writing and listening are effective."
"excellent pp with a good range of motivation twists to keep you practicing...and if you are ever tempted to whine, remember it is still free"
i love this program so much because not only does it teach you how to read and say the words but emphasized on pronunciation as well.
adding pictures to the words for association is absolutely the top layer of sprinkled one needs to learn effectively.
"this pp is an excellent addition to the desktop application, allowing study to continue when not at home."
"something that i really love about the experience is that, even though it may seem somewhat slow and simple at first, you'll find that you're actually learning without struggling."
the way that the program is structures reaches you how to think in your new language instead of just translating into it.
this so is good i enjoy it already watching a word with a picture is helping memories.
"rather than rousing on written exam, it actually helps you develop your basic intuition in conversations--which is what most of us really want."
"i'm enjoying my first lesson, hearing the way things sound, seeing pictures corresponding to the actions as well as feminine and masculine versions of the words, then sounding them out works for me."
i like how it rates verbal pronunciation so i can gauge what i need to work on
super easy to use very interactive i love how it encourages you to practice speaking the language are you learn to read and recognize phrases and word/characters
"the first lesson is enough to give you a feel for how the language works, and shows their unique method to making you uncover the answers on your own, instead of just telling you and having you memories it."

i like that it is more natural like a child would learn.
i love the practice lesson so far!
inaccessibility is awesome.
it goes along with the computer..it makes learning easy

clearly a lot of such research has been used to meticulously craft each course.

"roseola reinforced what i've learned, introduces additional vocabulary and grammar, and it helps me learn to think in the new language without mentally translating."
i like best the exercises that seem conversational and expect a natural response from me.
this pp makes you think and build your learning experience your own way by throwing right into experiencing the language.
"the pp tells you what words mean using pictures, and challenges you to break down the sentences yourself."
"at first it seemed way too challenging, but i was surprised when they asked me to describe a picture for the first time and i said a full sentence of japanese on my own!"
really installs the feeling of accomplishment.
"i'm glad they son well, though, so i can use either and stay caught up."
closest thing to a classroom as i can get.
the first lesson pushed me to figure out the meaning of the words for myself and encouraged me to try speaking them as well.
"i've tried domingo, which is free, but roseola stone tests your pronunciation much more accurately, and introduces new words by building on existing phrases that you've learned, which is a much more realistic and immersion way of learning than learning individual words in isolation of phrases."
"for learning vocabulary in an intuition way, roseola stone is much better than other programs."
"absolutely amazing and entertaining, a must have for any wanting to learn a new language quickly and enjoyable"
"it tests you on the same thing multiple times to make sure you can say it, hear it, and read it."
designed to teach you the same way you would learn as a child your own language.
no intermediate language required.
what i like is that they teach you small parts and bring it all together.
very natural way to learn.
doesn feel forced at all.
"i think it's a great way to learn with words and pictures, very child like learning which is something i had been looking for."
great for words and learning to pronounce them
"so intuition, its freak that i understand it, almost without trying."
the application makes sure you are pronouncing the the words correctly.
very interactive.
very easy to navigable and learning is quick with associations.
"great way to learn and understand language using pictures, sounded out audit, and even recording your voice letting you nail that pronunciation!"
it is invaluable for someone learning a language without a teacher as it subtly reaches the languages rules and reaches correct pronunciation of difficult words.
"no english translation, instead its all pictures and the spanish words."
i really like the voice interaction.
very good speech recognition
this is a fun interactive immediately satisfying confidence building program so far
"i like this pp, easily for leaning by pictures"
useful pp with lots of repetition
and i love that i get prompt reminding me to study.
"i love roseola stone so much, you should get it amazing graphics and amazing learning courses !"
the facility to listen and repeat in french is extremely useful.
getting into it repetition helps good free pp
easy to navigable
i really like the use of photo and not translations.
"i think this is really good, and for all the people wanting to learn for free this is good as you don't need to buy anything to use the basis."
it also doesn't waste as much time on hello goodby and starts including basic grammar very early on
it's a great tool that allows you to learn at your own pace wherever you may be.
"it's fairly easy to use, and the lesson plans come with set time frames that are typically short and sweet."
it.s nice that it also has pictures that really help usually as well which really helps with the visual memory.
"dont worry if you dont know what a phrase means, just hold down on the phrase or picture, and press see translation, it's as easy as that."
there are different categories that you can choose from for what kinds of words/phrases you want to learn.
that way i can division it in my head instead of having to translate it over first
"you attach sounds with images and ideas, not to english words."
it tests your pronunciation.
absolutely love the speech and communication breakdown technology and visual association!
each lesson is broken down to help improve pronunciation and build confidence speaking and perfecting tone and patience.
"the system is really effective because it allows your mind to associate words with images, not their english translations."
"this prevents you from getting caught up trying to think of what you want to say in english and translating it, and instead allowing you to think of the language directly"
was shocked just how well the phone pp worked compared to my other devices.
"carefully built up learning program, addressing different components (vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation); plenty of possibilities to practice; direct feedback during exercises; and a good balance between double and challenging."
"they even have stories to read, all without being on the premium version!"
one of the best pp for learning german especially for one without any previous knowledge (a).
i like how it uses pictures without your native language so you agent constantly translating back and forth.
i love being able to learn at my pace on my phone!
i'm a language teacher and i really approve of the concept of full immersion.
the pp runs cleanly and is almost more user friendly than the program itself.
emphasis on picture learning and repetition makes it easy and fun.
"only a few lessons in, and i'm thinking my answers in spanish, instead of searching for english translations in my head."
the method used is very efficient in retaining new information.
"i'm a visual learner so using the pictures really help me, and after only 30 minutes i knew some words in organ!of˜„"
great customer service from not only roseola stone but from goose representatives as well.
i like the fact that i can pick up where i left off from home.
i like having the images along with the vocabulary.
the way the pp listens to your pronunciation is helpful as well.
i believe that the dynamic of having both a visual and audit aid on top of the accent assistance makes thus a great learning tool.
uses only the language that you are learning so you think in that language rather than translating in your head.
great for kiss too!
similar to a puzzle.
this make it really easy to learn a language and you go up in steps so it build on what the last lesson was about making it easier to retain each days lesson.
"i just completed section 1. the pictures help, there's pronunciation assistance, and it was easy to follow."
"great interface, easy to learn with the immersion teaching, i can tell i'll be client in spanish in a few months"
"you think you don't understand a word, but in a couple of minutes, you're using it in sentences as if you've always known it."
total immersion is awesome this is an excellent way to learn a language keep up the good work!
constantly progressing but lots of opportunities to review what has already been learned
i love love love this pp â¤ï¸ its allowing me to learn easily not only is it auditory learning but interactive and visual as well which for someone who has aspergers among other disorders is so relieving.
"this is so fun & easy, if i get less than a 100% on a lesson it tells me to try for a 100%of˜… or i could go to the next lesson oh my goodness.... all ages can use it if able to ."
easy to use with a smart phone and very convenient for when i have a few moments to spain or an hour.
definitely money well spent .
"its fun asked so learning comes easy , has utilities to help with pronunciation also ."
"i love it because it reaches you a language the same way you learned your first language, by showing not translating"
gets you to understand without translating e very word in your head.
"very engaging way of learning, from grammar to pronunciation!"
very good and it clearly breaks down the pronunciation which helps greatly .
loving the immersion approach and the emphasis on pronunciation.
"love the no english approach, and the vocal seems more relevant to adult conversation then the endless stream of too animals used in domingo."
love how it breaks things down for you to help you learn better with languages but i hate how you have to buy it and it isn free
"i mean, such detail when it comes to teaching pronunciation of arabic!"
the picture method is so amazingly helpful compared to the years of wrote memorization.
other than the fact that it's an amazing language teacher its gun is very user-friendly.
good variety that keeps learning fun and plenty of reinforcement for good memory
it seems like playing a game instead.
"great program, repeats everything so you learn by repetition."
good amount of repetition.
