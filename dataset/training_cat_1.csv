today when doing a lesson the new year promotion popped up and after closing it my plus subscription is no longer active.
i still have until the end of april but can't find a way to reinstate the plus features.
tried reporting it through the help centre but that has a bug too and i'm unable to submit my request.
this pp isn't about learning anymore but a competition to stay in the league.
i try to learn for hours daily but i still get devoted and it's so frustration.
i end up doing stories to stay in the league instead of learning.
i'll have to look for another pp that is strictly for learning and not competing with imaginary people
never make learning process a competition.
competing in leagues and striving to secure place in top 10 has been one of the worst experiences.
"and this new health system is breaking, people learn with mistakes and they should be let to do so."
better domingo changes the way of health and the leagues.
"it was very good at first, but now it does not play sounds and pronunciation an there is no support for this problem"
"after the recent update, the pronunciation of the words and and sentences are gone."
i have to go on learning without sound and voice guide.
the pp others me several times per day and they send me multiple email per day to keep practicing.
"great pp without hearts, but really sucks with them."
you get five lives a day and then you lose one for every simple mistake.
they justify the hearts by saying that you won't learn new material if you spend too much time on the pp.
"this seems to be a flat out lie, because everything else is feared to making you want to spend more time learning, leagues, up's, etc."
"pp asks, what language do you speak but it's not showing rude neither i want to read text in rude , i prefer english text but i have to select environment from those languages which i can't even read .. why we must have to choose our language while we installed english version of pp there must be no restrictions on selecting language for environment as it can stay in english and user can learn any of your given language."
"now it is basically just a flash card game pp, not a true language course."
the heart feature they have added is useless - if it is my goal to learn a language in 3 months and i'm limited to 10 mistakes a day i'm not going to get very far!
"however, i hate the streaks and the leaderboard, i don't want to compete with others."
i want to learn at my own pace.
"i love this pp, though was hacked pretty badly after making exceptional progress and can't get my money back for the plus account and haven't received a response after reporting it three times."
they need a way to log out of all locations and two-factor authentication to fix these types of issues.
"i had to disabled my account after two years of progress, start over after a 69-day streak, and lost everything."
"it used to crash a lot, that has been fixed."
now i have an pp telling me i don't know how to read and write languages that i grew up with.
"if the people that designed this pp are so smart, i dare them to try and live one day on the streets of la speaking the spanish they say is spanish."
"also, the lack of help is awful in the pp."
i also tried domingo plus and it's not worth the money.
the new hearts addition is basically negative reinforcement.
"however, after the recent update with this awful heart system, i can no longer continue with my usual method of learning."
"actually , the words don't sound like its written."
and it had the worst start i guess!
"sorry to say , but its the worst pp to learn organ."
really good for french/spanish etc the!~
it just throws random characters at you and you have to figure out what they are and how they are used.
at first it was good but the audit portions are muffled and with egg making it difficult to discern the speech.
"also when it asks me to type the latin i hear, when i do it says i am tying in english."
poor quality control.
"""health"" (whatever that is) runs out every time you make a tiniest mistake."
"i failed to type the final ""m"" in ""mon"" at the end of a (somewhat lengthy) sentence, and it immediately erased a portion of my health find a better way to handle free users, or i'll find another way to practise my foreign language skill...."
"the language lists are not in alphabetical order which makes finding a language tricky, then the actual teaching doesn't help because they just say words so fast you can't really catch the proper pronunciation."
domingo has tricked me into paying again for the subscription by saying i lost my 397 day streak when i didn't as i had streak freeze bought.
"now i played 10$ for the subscription, had to cancel the securing payments, checked the pp, got back my streak, but the monthly streak repair (the reason i bought the subscription) wasn't used up."
meaning domingo lied to me into paying.
i have now lost all my nights for shipping a day.
i used plus for a month and it sucked because office mode is super buggy and it doesn't download enough lessons at a time.
you also lose your streak unless connected to the internet every day so i lost my nearly 300 day streak even though i studied office every day!
finally single month sub cost should be closer to 6/simon sub costs- like $8/month.
it's not right to have to spend $13/mon for the same thing bc i'm too poor to pay $50 at once.
"cannot delete a language properly, it just replaces it whenever you delete a course."
"mobile pp is extremely inferior to the desktop version, esp."
"alternative answers from english to other languages are not accepted, despite them being valid in the language spoken."
"doesn't explain why you got something wrong, esp."
get rid of the hearts!
this pp could be amazing if they would get rid of the hearts/lives aspect of it.
having to wait 5 hours while trying to learn a new language is making this harder than it already is.
"get a heart, start a lesson, but once you make another mistake you are back to waiting another 5 hours."
cynical money grab.
"i use this pp all the time, and they've just added 'lives' meaning if you run out, the pp locks you out so you can't learn until they get restored after a period of time or you buy more."
this is a dreadful update and will certainly negative affect my experience.
the male and the female pronounced words differently.
someone struggling with pronunciation will never get better if the pp isn't consistent itself.
i also felt like it didn't cover grammar at all.
your bug report section doesn't work 1. launch application around pm.
i liked it up until i lost all my up points.
"i worked really hard to get up to nearly 2000, then all of a sudden i go down to 29..with?!"
i was #1 then i went down to with when i clearly was beating the person who was in the new #1 spot.
"apparently i was supposed to go into a new league but when i checked, i was still in the same one."
"lessons loading slowly, lagging, lacks of pronunciation after a lesson and the subscription button (i was forced to post to be subscribed and attacked by a moderate, thus 1 star), the ""can't listen/talk"" button is placed in a very inconvenient position and causes disabling lessons by accident; the pp doesn't have stories and the forum, inability to disabled the word bank.. and now do leaves regardless of what settings say, no motivation messages, he just abandons you after few lessons."
lost my streak even though i had a streak freeze on.
"i signed up to do the trial of domingo plus, i used it once or twice but, it's within 2 weeks of the first payment being taken, i haven't done anything with the account and i can't claim a refund... what happened to the consumer cooling off period?"
how many times do i have to do the same exercise for it to count my experience and streak ?
it was a five star pp until it burned me for a 536 day streak even with a streak freeze in place.
burned her for a 675 day streak with a streak freeze in place.
"the owl said tagalog would be released over a year ago, yet still nothing, but clinton is there."
"i placed th in the gold league and was supposed to move up to the sapphire league, but i'm still in the gold league."
i tried to submit feedback but its having issues.
but it'll is bad when it comes to basic grammar.
it doesn't teach it but expect you to know how to write it.
does not track streaks correctly.
no obvious way to report bags.
no obvious way to provide accents to letters.
new update with hearts is a reckon terrible.
"you can't learn day-to-day without buying premium because there are not enough hearts, and you have to do exercise to obtain hearts which leads to nothing, just another repeated sequence."
"one missed comma in sentence and you have to repeat it again and again, it's irritating"
this was free before.
please make this available office
"now it doesn't load at all, or constantly has a message that there's no connection regardless of whether i'm on wife or using data."
the new hearts system makes it unable and removed the lighthearted learning experience.
the heart system is useless.
really they just want you to pay for the pp.
"wasn' t that convinced by it, but now i am blocked as i don't have any hearts, i'll look at other ways to learn."
who can learn a language and make only 5 mistakes.... please be honest domingo..you are now a pay for pp.
"can't sign in, create a new account, or connect with friends."
the study got tucked i have seen no option to skin or to go forward.. and there is no option in the to report the problem.
"using from last more than 20 days, but now sometimes shows ""no internet connection "" &i lost all recent work, after uninstalling again download but after use of sometime again shows connection problem."
"fix the new 5 hearts per lesson, please."
the lessons load forever regardless of network quality and audit is missing half of the time.
"surely, this can be fixed instead of ""changing how daily streaks work""?"
"the playback from the sentences fails to speak out the whole sentence, it only output the last words."
i need to click on the speaker button to hear them completely.
i can't change my profile picture.
i just want to change my profile picture.
"at the new version it doesn't say the word or phrases, why?"
they just delete streak freeze without warning and i lost almost 90 days.
very bad quality of translation to russian.
"is there a reason that there is ""health""?"
why is this treated as a game?
"trying to report a bug on the pp and it doesn't let me, which is apparently another bug."
"speak ""free"", as soon as you run out of ""hearts"" they force you to wait or buy more."
"constantly states ""check your internet connection"" despite being connected g or wife."
won't download lessons in advance either.
paid for a 2 year subscription but can't even use it.
kept smiling support without response until they replied to tell me my goose fixed 2 isn't supported and to buy another phone!
"since the update, the pp asks for a curl login code."
it is more expensive than it is worth i would rather have just got babel but sadly now i don't have a choice.
it locked me out after using it only 2 months saying it was on another account.
"after they charged me again for another $50,i still can't use it again."
"this pp isn't engaging enough, i found it boring and slow and it didn't teach me anything."
pp keeps telling me sign-in failed.
"when i attempted to contact support, chat doesn work either."
i can't even log in.
"application tried to remove money from my account without my knowledge, she wanted to pay 3 months of english even though i didn't even log in to create a profile on that application, so i do not recommend this application, beware of fraud"
pp is not opening i tried it on my phone as well as on my friend's phone but its not opening.
"can't see the pictures, navigation not intuition."
"i tried to use this pp to further my study in the japanese language, but it seems that there is no beginner course."
how the hell am i supposed to figure out what the words that i can read with just pictures?
the program has the student repeat a russian word or phrase and gives only a picture for the description.
"i often for the free trial, and they immediately charged my card $49."
i want to like this pp so much but honestly how am i expected to learn a new language if you just tell me to say things with no explanations at all?
i get not using english but so far is has taught me nothing but random words with no real in-depth learning of the grammar.
"paid full price to have full access to the language learning lessons, but the subscription was not added to my account and i received error messages when trying to use the software."
i sent six email to the customer support and only received one reply asking for proof of purchase.
the customer support is terrible.
(but i'm the unit bottom it says 32 out of 32) please add dark mode.
"the pp is so white, learning at night is very tedious on the eyes."
"it's pretty expensive for me, make it free, put some adds, i'll never complain about it."
"was wrapped by misleading ad for ""free"" trial."
they charged for 3 months even though i canceled immediately they kept my money.
"the pp is great for learning, and i really anna learn more but when i press on purchase all lessons, the page for paying doesn't appear."
i have roseola stone on my computer and it is perfectly fine.
the andros pp is trash by comparison and not worth the scene subscription cost.
i tried to use it during my morning commune and find that i rarely get a response from the pp when doing pronunciation.
you have to scream to get a response.
"don't waste your money here, wait for a slickdeals sale and buy the pp version for a one-time fee."
"but it updated 2 weeks ago and has since not worked, coming up with an error message whenever i click on a module."
i have contracted the support team twice with regards to it and they are yet to respond with anything more than an email giving me a case number.
professional and currently just bleeding my bank account for nothing.
"they say 30-day guaranteed refund, so i decide to buy the unlimited use japanese version on march and, but i quickly decide (the following day) to cancel it and get it refused, but, i can't!"
"because i bought it through goose play, i can't get a refund (i tried all the steps they provide, and nothing, goose keeps automatically denying my request)."
"if you hesitate with your purchase on goose play, you'll get sir*wed over."
"2 hours after signing up, 29.99 gets pulled out of my bank even though i canceled as i was aware of auto renew after 3 days."
my play store pp is not letting me request a refund (option isn't there?).
"when i contracted roseola, they just gave me a link to their pp fads which had nothing to do with refund."
didn't care that my money has been taken for a free trial
signed me out and won't let me sign back in.
"i'm now concealing my subscription after not being able to resolve the issue through customer support, but it's not giving me the option for a return if my funds."
"while i get the way you are trying to teach, you still need to add a translation or something to tell the user what they are learning, in the domo for japanese there's 1 question that has no rhyme or reason for why its structures the way it is, you literally have to guess, all 4 pictures it showed had nothing i could see to do with each other, and the fill in the blank it gave had no explanation why it went where it did."
the pp is ok but i had to guess the correct answer because it isn't explained what the actual meaning of it is.
"but the pp has me saying things but it does not tell me exactly what i was saying, just pictures that i have to guess."
"the pp will ask if you are a beginner, intermediate or advanced, but you cannot open any intermediate lesson without buying them, so the only way to try the pp is to start with the very basis, 'hello and goodby'."
not buying without trying.
"only the application is free, but content is paid."
this should be clear in the description.
"it wastes the user time ilstalling an application because of wrong, misleading or incomplete information."
i do not recommend it for the price.
but you find out unlimited is limited real quick.
limited to try to get you to fork over more money.
i want to give it 5 stars honestly it helped me learn spanish... but it also kept charging me $25 a month without my knowledge!
"what is even worse is they charge you before they say they will, my subscription was apparently supposed to renew on the with but i was charged a day early on the with and they refuse to refund anything."
keeps locking me out of the nodules.
"but i never use this pp before, how can it say that my email have already used."
it will not let me log in or make a free account i have tried everything and still won't work.
the cos will not work at all on a chromebook as well.
"i can't help but be really confused it's making me say long sentences out loud on the first day with barely any practice, and it's driving me insane how many times i have to try."
money hungry.
the company wont give you the mobile languages even though i purchased the desktop versions.
"so this pp wants me to spend around 1,000 dollars so i can practice both on my desktop and on mobile?"
waste of my money for a 3 months access for $50 when all i get is few core lessons or force to go full access for extra $100-200 so disappointed from this waste of my money and time for basic free trial lessons (but for $50)
when i tried a trial period which was suggested in this pp it took money from my goose account.
never could get the voice phases to work properly.
i dont use it anymore and they are still charging me.
"yet another booooring subscription pp from greedy developer, that don't bother to explain clearly that this is a subscription pp, before installing."
don't download this pp if you are an english speaker looking to learn first.
from course one you are asked to repeat long sentences.
"if you can't read first, you have to do this purely by audit (listening+repeating) which for many earners isn't possible."
it's not free so couldn't even give it a try.
there were no basis to the alphabet.
the pp does not show the translations in english like it says it does and there is no support
it's not the right way for a beginner to learn .
you can't just say a word over and over and have it written in japanese .
but it doesn't say what the word means or anything
pp doesn't work anymore on chromebook.
so disappointing that this pp does not offer at least one african language option.
swahili is a language spoken widely throughout africa and this is not an option available on the pp.
you get a free trial period but you have to make a subscription to it.
verbal is off on the phone.
"""sales department"" takes my money and gives me the wrong language and i call 5 minutes later for them to tell me sales department cannot cancel or change orders."
"only ""customer service"", which is closed, can change orders."
no authorization given for charges!
it did not show me what i was saying in english but only filipino.
i have the 5 day learning thing for learning a language and it has said for the past three days that i'm done learning for the day as soon as i open the pp.
i haven't been able to do any of the core lessons because i have to buy them and i personally think that the plans are way too expensive.
$50 for only 3 months??
wont let me cancel my subscription
thought it was free...i installed...will my card be killed
"terrible , didn't teach me anything just went strait ahead to the hard stuff even though it was on basic."
i can't find a way to remove the account.
how to delete the account?
this game wouldn't tell me the means of the word so i couldn't find the answer
can't cancel same day and get refund.
doesn't recognise correct speech.
i really love this pp but the recent update is awful.
i lost a 161 day streak because of that!
get a few wrong questions wrong and you can't continue learning.
"this is intended for english people, many things are not precise in this pp."
please make updated mandatory.
"about a month in i tried to get my girlfriend to join, but for whatever reason her game uses ""hearts"" where mine uses ""lights""."
"this difference literally means that she cannot do what i have been doing, which is playing for about 5 minutes each day."
"the heart system actually stops you from learning and instead blocks you with a pay wall to play their ""free"" pp..."
"only feared towards an american audience, for both spanish and english earners (even the flags are wrong)."
the same with portuguese.
it's very inconsistent when his-tying due to finger errors.
"however, the biggest problem is there are never any explanations as to why the rule is as it is."
you only know if it's right or wrong and have no indication why this is the case.
very limited but a decent option to start learning some basic vocabulary for a new language.
this new heart thing doesn't work.
i got answers that are right but lose hearts regardless.
i get penalized for minor spelling errors.
and on top of that i need gems to refill those hearts.
how long does it take to refill those gems.
it might help you get more subscribers but whatever.
learning has turned from something fun to a stupid grind to refill my hearts.
doing japanese course in introduction and it is extremely frustration when using you/natasha no name wa madura hand desk.
when using 'desk' in the sentence it is purely at random of and can get me to lose a hearts.
it feels more like luck instead of learning.
please fix as this feels like an intentional feature to buy premium membership which goes against your motor if free learning.
it was a awesome pp at the beginning but the sound has stopped since i started italian.
i tried every way to fix it but didn't answer.
you cut off the option for regenerate hearts!
"i know the office option isn't free but please domingo, you guns where doing it right."
the heart system ruined it.
"ever since they implements the heart system, this pp is pay to progress, despite it being heavily advertisement tormented to ""keep learning free""."
since the heart system you are only allowed five mistakes per lesson or you have to pay the in pp currency to refill your hearts.
you now need to pay lights to test out of a level.
that is really infuriating for people who want/can to progress fast.
update (30-dec-2019): it is now the second time that i open my domingo on a monday morning to find that my streak freeze was used up even though i had a weekend amulet.
i can't take anymore a placement test when doing another course.
"then you can't delete a course, i mean that if you took one course for english speaker, you cannot delete it if it's the only one, even having a lot more for french speaker, so you're king of getting lost with courses for different language speaker, i wanted to try but i don't like and i can't remove it."
"also why did you stop to offer ""free test"" .... please do something"
"tried to learn hind.. and i noticed problems, such as different bowels sound exactly the same, there no distinction at all, and sense it's just a guess which one to choose, most like leading to making mistake."
"also, i couldn't complete several tasks due to the pp not accepting the correct answer."
"and the last, it doesn't have any grammar notes or explanation, so it's really like running in the fields with no direction"
there's a problem with singing information on the domingo pp on mobile devices and on the domingo on the computer.
"i practiced on my computer, but it didn't reflect on my phone."
also why is there different lesson information on the domingo on pus?
"i used to love this pp and progressed rapidly, but then they started using the heart health and penalizing me for mistakes on new lessons."
and i've been extremely frustrated with the hearts and having to quit a lesson towards the end because i ran out of hearts.
please go back to lights and no hearts!!!!
"i tried to use the online version, which doesn't have the hearts, but it's hard to use on a mobile devise."
ply discontinue the hearts!
"ok so i've been using this pp for years and it's always been helpful but the update is such a downgrade, i live in an area where phone signal and wife are spot so i used to download the lessons and do them office, but now i apparently have to pay $12.99 monthly???"
"also you can't see all the lessons in a group ( ex you used to click on ""basis"" and it would show you what you were donna learn in every lesson) and the progress quires used to be free so you could skin things you already knew.."
i used to actually retain information with this repetition practices and high daily goals.
now goals mean nothing and lessons are short and not memorable.
the hearts system makes this otherwise great pp unstable.
"you can't repeat the lesson, even from the beginning."
"you have to wait hours, reach few hours you get one more heart, which is one more answer you can get wrong."
"not sure though, maybe they will have hearts after you pay too."
"as long as you dont mind that it can and will take pictures, look at your personal pictures, record audit, record video, modify your settings, modify your sd card, read data on your sd card, delete content on your sd card, search, find and view other accounts tied-in with your phone, analyze wife connections, analyze data from anyone else who is on the same wife as you, run at start up and listen through your microphone."
"to learn words its ok, as its an online pp, there is no explanation as to when and why the word/meanings/phases change, just when you think you've got it, not so!"
"unfortunately i used the plus free trial, and missed the cancellation date, so of course i was charged $167.00, beware as it auto renew in 12 months, together with being constantly bombarded with email from them."
completely stuck on multiple hind courses.
there are stages in the lessons which have a 'match the letter to the sound' portion and to« and the« sounds each do not allow me to match them with the provided symbols.
so far my only option has been to spend gems to take the test to skin the lesson but if those sounds come up during the lesson then i've wasted gems and cannot continue.
this pp is good but falls short in one aspect it will sometimes allow bad swellings of words when it may be one letter off but other times it will fail you for the same misspelling regardless of level.
they also hit you with phrases out of the blue where they have not even covered that phrase or even those words so you are forced to spend more time checking the translation then actually learning anything.
immersion is better than showing translation.
i did not find it enough helpful in learning japanese karagina and anti!
japanese teaching method is also odd here.
one should probably find some other apes if they have to learn eastern languages....
"it relief on rd parties to clarify concepts, which aren't available for every exercise."
it is inconsistent in its accepting translations.
"it provides insufficient preliminary information permanent to the exercises, a lacking variety in practice examples, which only reinforced familiarity with the specific examples, not the concepts."
edit: they've introduced a delay in shipping as.
"the actual content is great, however in the past few years they have began charging money for many things that were previously free, and up the lingo prices for everything, downed the amount of lights that are actually earned, and have limited you to only being able to make 5 mistakes before you have to pay to use the pp or you need to wait 24+ hours to use it again."
"i am no longer a satisfied user of domingo because of all the money charges, and excessive advertising for money charging"
like the pp but i find the font far to small and unable to make it bigger.
it's misleading when it says one can use it office using the paid version.
"it needs to update itself all the time, so if there's no internet connection, there's nothing one can do."
"all the time there's an error message when one click on a lesson, to work, one needs to click a second time."
"sometimes the volume goes out, mid exercise."
"you can see the speaker animation, but the voice is mute."
the pp is fine and i like the way it work but the hearts system is terrible and really keeps you from progressing.
my wife has the pp on her phone and its great bc it doesn have the hearts system.
being allowed 5 mistake a day is insane.
nice concept but very buggy and zero customer support.
"the program for learning italian is badly explained (idioms and unusual construct thrown in without any prior or later explanation ) , very repetition (same examples over and over and over again until your autocorrect already learns them), contains some weird and frankly disturbing sentences for practice ('when do they die?"
the users are left to each other for support and advice.
frustrated by the pressure to create a profile.
"nice application, however i got stock at one step of the game, where you have to pair sound with the word, sound doesn't play at one button and does not allow to continue"
i'm trying to learn russian but it's trying to make me type in russian but my phone wont let me use a russian keyboard.
if you dont a keyboard for the language you want to learn(on your device)then dont download domingo.
the hearts i use in learning my language never gets filled and this has been happening for months even after i updated the pp.
"the application does not work in portrait mode, and feedback is stuck in a loop via catch to report it."
not useful when using a fixed keyboard
the new update is upsetting because the older version is cheaper and doesn't limit you with hearts.
"teach support is responsive, questions and comments get locked."
study material is not provided.
the material is very repetition.
even though i finished first place in a league it didn't move me to the next league or give me any credit for my lessons i tried to report the issue but it denied it 4 time when trying to submit it so i gave up i refuse to pay for an pp that i can't submit a problem to the company
poor pp support.
the plus 'office' feature does not work and i cannot get a refund for the 6 month subscription i paid Â£48 to use.
constantly asks about domingo plus and referring a friend for a free week.
"however, upon referring a friend, no free week is given and the founding over trying plus is more annoying than the as."
"the actual pp is very helpful, but once u get too many questions wrong u run out of hearts, so have to wait hours to go back on the pp."
"shows i have a ratification, but when i open the pp and look for a ratification, there's nothing there."
and there's no way to get rid of the ratification indication... annoying.
2. the same happened again. i was fifth of ten to get into the diamond league.. and i didn't get it again.. i wonder why they make the competition if they don't let you win!!!
"1. i am really mad, because i was eighth for the diamond league, and just when the countdown finished, it said that something went wrong and i did not get the level!!!"
"don't let people compete i'd you are not going to give them the points, or the next level.."
people abuse the practice lessons to gain up to remain at the top of leaderboards which makes it unfair to the people who have updated apes and learn the legitimate way.
i would rate 5 stars if i riding have to deal with answering right several times and no matter what i enter it says in wrong!
or there wont be sound for the listening exercises.
you took away my 311 day streak--even though i was equipped with a streak freeze!--just to try to force me to pay for streak repair!!
buggy interface on my andros device makes replying sounds frustration because the pp thinks you are selecting an answer.
"also the mid is unable to differentiate even simple absent noise, making the spoken exercises impossible in anything other than a silent padded room."
poor pp design.
"i finished all 12 units of japanese for school, just to get told that i haven't done the writing lessons, which aren't even available on the pp!"
"also, the speech recognition needs work."
"i've had several instances where i said the correct answer perfectly, and all the words lit up as correct, but then it gives me a red ""x"" and i have to say it again."
"i'm making no progress whatsoever, i'd recommend learning arabic a different way."
the microphone performance is extremely louse.
"nor can you select or even see what input device is being used, if for example a bluetooth device is connected."
"thank you roseola stone, for being the most expensive language learning pp you have failed to deliver on the most critical feature."
it tries to offer the same functionality like the desktop but fails.
"the problems that i encountered are: 1.the pictures are too small, 2.is lacking functionality of the desktop version, 3.twitching between japanese alphabet is a pain, 4.the pp sometimes forgets the credentials, 5.it requires constant internet connection even if you choose to download the lesson."
"speech recognition sometimes works... for a product asking for so much money, i would expect more."
very sluggish pace.
"-animation take too much time, to the point where it's 30 seconds animation for 1 click."
the idea of the pp is amazing but it's very hard without any english words to learn chinese!
sometimes i can't understand what those characters mean and it's very hard to use by the sound inman to translate them into english in goose translator.
"not good for kiss,it is very hard to recognize kiss voice."
"i am try using this pp with my 6 years son learn english,stuck at ""a girl is drinking"",i am try lot of times,include loud and whisper,adjust option to male or femaleï¼Œadjust sensitivity.all not work.still not recognize."
too expensive.
"but, you have to buy the pp."
and it's not cheap.
mio it should be included in the (not cheap) price of the d program.
way too expensive and not a great way to learn.
if you want to learn a language this pp is good to instal but when you are learning the language it asks you to say a certain phrase but it always says that the audit is too loud.
pp requires microphone lessons.
the software shouldn't only be pictures.
it should be a combination of their current software with spoken definitions.
"great language leaving option but way to much money, honestly i prefer domingo purely because it's free and you can complete all courses without paying, with roseola, you can do two or three lessons and then you have to pay Â£100 a year."
it's not picking up my voice.
"i have remained, treated but i don't get a response."
"not great for learning, audit technology is not great."
"canceled my subscription on goose play, but then got charged again through their webster, with no way to contact them to get my $80 back."
the andros pp does not have translations.
i was saying the words exactly the same and each time it recorded something different.
i wasn't able to login in to my account on the mobile pp.
after i forgot something it wouldn't let me do it again even though i used the rest button.
just pictures and the program saying words.
i bet its amazing but i can't afford it because i don't have the money for it (it's $94.99 a month)
how do you close the pp?
its good but it moves at a very slow pace.
it's not challenging enough.
it keeps enforcing basic vocabulary using baby sentences while occasionally adding new words.
"it's also clot of multiple choice which helps you choose the right answer by eliminating the obvious wrong answers, which makes it too easy and doesn help me learn."
they need less multiple choice and more speaking without words on screen.
"others, like organ, seem to have been designed by a teenager only interested in talking about boy bands/ girl bands... seriously, skin all logical vocabulary and into sentences and go straight into ""that singer is not cool. """
please design organ so it makes sense.
"i'm disappointed that we must learn the sounds of characters before their meanings, which often inspire their shape."
i wish they added a voice recognition to practice saying the words/symbols/ and sentences.
"also the listening exercises don't work after the last update and i don't hear anything, please fix this problem."
"however, after an (old) update, provided comments, but received no response from developer, i am a little disappointed with their customer engagement."
"... ... old comment : ""i can no longer see how many words i've learnt this month, (and the previous month's either) also, where are the little graph of progress etc ""what were you thinking""?"
"it would be more, realistic if they allowed month to month membership."
"it irs me that the as claim to be to help everyone learn for free, yet they don't have a pay plan for those of us who are on fixed incomes, and are striving to change that."
newsflash domingo... not everyone who uses this pp is so wealthy they can afford to give you a year up front...& not everyone who uses this pp is so dirt poor that free is the only answer.
it keeps putting me in office mode.
i got to level four and then it took me back to level three so i finished a part of level three and it rest me back to the beginning of level three again?
"i would give you 5 stars but the environment you designed for is is better that the one for andros, if you improve the andros one maybe, maybe i would give you the 5 stars and pay the plus subscription."
now i am taking down another star because the speaking exercises are annoying.
my internet connection is perfectly fine yet it's failing to connect to the internet.
the hearts (that you use to practice) don't continue to charge unless you open the pp again.
clicked the hearts to see the time... started counting down 5 hours.. please fix the refill period of the hearts.
i kept trying to log back in using my email but it kept saying there was an error.
i will give it 3 stars because i learned basis of german just in 2 days but now the sounds in the listening exercises aren't coming so i have to skin it moreover earlier when i pressed any word it used to pronounce it for me which helped a lot but it has stopped i don't know why it happened but ply help me i really like this pp .
"the audit in listening exercises is not working, also when selecting an answer it doesn read it, while the sound when u answer correctly can be heard."
so many duplicate answers while learning japanese while only one of them is good.
makes it impossible to go through many lessons as you are faced with 1/2 chances of looking a heart everytime you come by such questions.
"however, it falls short on several points: 1. the tips doesn't cover what is in the skill."
"furthermore, the tips aren't show at the beginning."
"to fix this, it is suggested to give the tips at the first level and lesson of each skill."
the bell button should be for reviews.
"2. the league leaderboard may not be synchronised, i had more up gained in that day but others are ranged higher."
please add the ability to use the keyboard to do the exercises.
"forcing me to use word banks means i don't learn anything, and subsequently, repeatedly install the pp and use the desktop version instead."
then i'd use all my stars trying to figure things out i'd get discouraged finally i just quit playing.
if this pp had some short tutoring video it would help.
this pp would have been awarded 5 stars had it given the learner a way to connect and communicate with other earners more efficiently.
please provide gratification to those of us wanting to communicate.
this pp is very good and i really enjoy it but i dont know why i have no audit and can hear anything.
"ok so this pp is really nice and i like that it reaches you stuff for free, but ever since they put that ""you only have 5 hearts"" thing it's not enjoyable anymore, i'm learning russian and it's really hard for me to make no mistakes i would rate full stars but the heart thing is ridiculous, oh and you have to wait hours to get your hearts back, but besides all of that, it's really helpful would recommend"
what i don't like is how the pp is clearly accepting data from other apes on my phone to serve me as (e.g.
"additional, the pp frequently rests during a lesson and you lose all your work and have to start the lesson over."
i truly like this pp.. but i dont know but has happened that i can listen to the andros!
"i have a problem with this pp, recently i have audit problems in pp it doesn work for many lessons."
"also after the latest update there are new problems, solve them please"
"for japanese, domingo needs work."
"sometimes i get anti i've never seen before, not spelled out."
"lastly, for japanese, social context is important."
"it reaches that ""domo"" is an acceptable way to say thanks, but it's only for informal cases, and would be considered rude if used casually"
i hope they implement an assignment tax soon.
the update where you only need 5 lessons to get to the next level has seriously missed up the whole experience.
i wish it didn't drain my battery so fast.
"edit (11/7): i just learned that the grammar tips and whatnot are only available on the web version, save for the few languages the added to in the last update."
"my biggest issue (i'm learning spanish) is often you are asked to type what you hear, i've ran into the problem where the pp says ""un"" but it is supposed to be ""un"" and i get dined for it."
the only thing that bags me for a while is that i cannot access the lecture notes in the pp itself.
dark mode would be much appreciated swell.
white on white makes me blind after a while...
"but, the phrases used (spanish) to teach the language are weird, and sometimes just unnatural."
"also, don't like the leagues, it makes it more about racking up points instead of learning the language."
"i'm a big fan of do, but (re)introducing the health system in the pp makes me totally disappointed (and the pp unable, mio)."
so i learned using the andros pp but today the hearts appeared in the andros version also.
the free version of this pp now gives you a limit of 5 mistakes.
"but, there is a constant bug causing the sound files to not load properly, resulting in silent lessons that punish you for not being able to hear the language."
"the snug, patronizing, unskippable ""here's a tip"" screens make me want to throw my phone out of the window."
"some courses are good, like japanese and chinese, while some others are horrible, like organ."
this is the best pp but for some reason after the updated the sound doesn't work.
it is also quite limited and overlay repetition.
there is little to no actual instruction on grammatical rules so you kind of have to guess and hope for the best.
"if i was only doing french i would give the pp 4 or 5 stars, but the organ course is lacking."
the early lessons can sometimes use sentences so simple that it's impossible to drive the intended meaning.
the second and most irritating issue is the quality of the audit.
it's hard to hear exactly what is being said often due to how muddy the audit is.
this is a learning tool not a game.
there shouldn't be lives!
"it's not even like the lives charge quickly, no, it takes 5 hours!"
"so i highly recommend the brother, but don't use the pp."
but now i lost interest in it because of it's new feature that allows you to go to the next checkpoint only when you have completed all the 4 levels of each chapter in the previous checkpoint.
this is very annoying because sometimes i dont feel like repeating all the levels of the chapter because i feel i have learnt it enough and it was easier.
give flexibility to the user to move ahead!
disappointed that it's more like a game than lessons.
hard to keep going if you make mistakes and run out of life and have to wait for more energy.
"however after a couple of weeks the pp stopped working, not warding health or points.of¤¨"
one new feature that is more annoying is the breaking of previously completed skill at a rate that at my current learning goal results in only 1 new lesson every 2 days.
"so very tired of ""no health left"" penalty that locks the pp when you get answer wrong."
i listen to your as as faithfully to support you but you lock me out constantly.
it would be 5 stars if the voice recognition worked.
then it uses all my hearts and i can practice until the hearts restore in a day.
they need to make it so you dont lose a heart if they can get the voice recognition to work properly.
"good for beginners, not great for if you are trying to perfect a language you already know."
you can no longer see the up under or next to each language which really helped me see which one i should practice first or more.
please please please add the up where you pick your languages.
"i just dont like the whole heart point thing, it really limits the whole learning process."
"so the more incorrect answers you give, the less you can learn."
"you should learn from your mistakes, not be punished for them..."
it's ok.. i can afford the paid option so its a little annoying when my hearts /lives disappear into thin air which happens regularly
give come on today and only have 3 when i haven even done anything!
"this is a pitch that needs sorting... not everyone can pay out for games, and i dont have an issue with as."
great pp with poor hints and pronunciation.
"i love that it says learn for free, but you get about 5-10 minutes a day that's free"
"great learning pp, but i hate that you lose an entire lesson when you're heart health runs out because of mistakes."
it makes any lesson you get wrong even longer because you have to repeat it and it hurts you from getting points to be in the leader board.
its advertised as free yet isn free because you run out of gems to buy hearts.
"reducing to three starts, because: - the latest update has missed with my progress!"
"i had 5/15 done for many sections on level 4, but now they are complete; - for a few days domingo appears to drain my phone's battery like hell!"
"it constantly appears in the list of apes that used the battery for the past n minutes, and the battery discharges two times faster than before."
improve the organ lessons.
"i started a test and then it said ""an error occurred"" and i didn't get my 5 gems back... and that's the th time now."
fun but itchy.
"lost gems when i buy more hearts (does not replenished hearts, only takes gems), not gaining hearts at the given time frame."
i have to close and re open pp between levels or it clashes.
too many push modifications.
no obvious way to contact customer service in free version.
there have been so many changes and they are not all good.
the pp will not work in landscape mode on a tablet.
"but -- even though i have the microphone permission on, the pp won't let me do the recorded spoken exercises."
its system of hearts discourages making mistakes when in reality everyone makes mistakes.
"it is a good incentive to learn but at the same time, you often run out of hearts and can't resume learning a language."
would have given it a five if you wouldn have added the health aspect into it i think that is a huge drawback to this pp i understand the benefits of the concept but you are already practicing as you go so why limit how much you can learn in a day by having to have health it makes no sense just makes it harder to go forward
"domingo plus offers progress quires, but the content is dominated by vocabulary and grammar that hasn't been introduced."
"also, there is not enough emphasis on spelling and speaking new words and phrases."
it's good for the method of teaching but it lacks in explaining masculine/feminine and why a word is pluralized or singular.
for example the word in the sentence is singular but the french word is plural.
"now this pp is riddle with painless modifications and as, gamificafion knob cracked to 11. i get you want to make money but this is still mostly volunteer work."
would be an amazing pp but it takes too long to restore hearts so i'm getting nowhere.
it says free trial but i click it and it wants me to pay for the year!
my biggest grip with this pp is the voice portion when learning vietnamese.
"the pronunciation are too quick, and you don't get a chance to hear it well enough."
"i think you should remove the latest updated when it comes to wait for 3 or 4 hours just to get an heart so you can practice, but anyway it is a good pp and helpful one"
but the heart part of it is annoying.
"pp is good, but be aware that the paid version is a 60$ a year subscription, -not- a pay 10$ once to clock the no as version."
but the health thing is annoying.
and the as taking up to 30 seconds to finish is also annoying.
however i find that it relief too much on phrase learning and should not be a replacement for actual education in the language.
"the pp would get 6 stars if not for their new ""leagues."""
"for those of us actually interested in learning, competing with people that are earning thousands of points a day is counterproductive."
"nice pp anything free is going to be selling , unfortunately every time i get 1 wrong i am locked out for hours as i have no "" hearts "" i cannot afford to buy hearts but would like more of a chance to evolve"
oh oh after an update the forts are now too small to read on my mobile.
but the pp does a poor job of adjusting if the learner (me) starts to struggle.
"though, it is not saying the words to me, when i tap them."
"when i first got it there weren't even as, this is unfortunate."
it really helps and i love it the pp is helping me learn spanish h.c but why the neck would you add a heart system i just want to learn different languages not make a couple mistakes and wait a day just to make the same mistakes and i keep making the same mistakes because i can practice the nodding language.
old good pp get rid of heart is i know its for microtransactions and you guns need your money but really 5 hearts
"but when i try to tap the next level, it reload, fix this, for favor i don't anna lose my 6 day streak."
it is very good that the languages are taught for free....the only complain is that it takes clot of time to load
"if you back out to the main menu and then click on a lesson, the wrong lesson comes up and you have to stroll through the lessons subfolders until you find the one you are looking for."
the only thing i would add is the enunciation under the word.
i'm learning hebrew and i wish they would show the english version of what i'm learning because i have no idea what i'm really saying.
"the pp so far is pretty good; however it keeps crashing, has required 2 starts and it a little buggy on some of the screens."
"too advanced, i don't recommend for beginners"
great pp but not consumer friendly as far as pricking and payment goes.
$200 is too much up front to clock all of the units and i'm unwilling to pay monthly for something i'll never own.
i would be much more willing to pay to clock units as i progress.
there 20 units for spanish and i'd lady pay $10 to clock each unit as i progress.
having problem putting new amazon prime purchase key into old learning pp from trial.
hard to navigable at times
the two problems that i have are not having any explanation of what grammar i am learning and no way for me to gauge how well my pronunciation is.
most of the time you can get the gist of what the program is trying to teach you but outside of word memorization i feel like i would get more out of having an explanation of the lesson before taking the practices
when you try to pronounce a word sometimes the just doesn't hear it no matter how loud you are.
"can you please fix the bug were it is not testing my speech, just going to the next picture."
i wish i didn't need a computer to have the live sessions.
"i can't use the total version, when i'm not home."
good to start basic vietnamese with lacking in learning layout should start with alphabet learning first then go onto grammar structure instead its reversed but overall it's good program
"great pp, but it's just too expensive."
but there is no back feature in this pp.
"there are several very annoying bags:  - periodically it starts ""continue automatically to next screen"" even when this option is turned off;  -  sometimes it does not recognize the voice;  - long loading time;  - after started shows the random lesson in the unit to learn instead of the first to be done."
the pp is extremely frustration when it comes to pronunciation.
it says the word once and then just buzzed you if you say it wrong and wants you to try again without saying it to you again to help you get it right.
its a good pp but i mean it gives you a monthly pay but you actually have to pay the whole price for the term its very irritating because i want to pay monthly.... due to the fact that i dont know how long it will take me to finish the course but i can and i dont want to have to pay a 6 month subscription if in donna finish in just 4 months or have to buy a 6 month and then not finish and have to buy the three month set only not to use the whole three month set
much better on the computer version in my opinion.
many of the buttons on mobile are difficult to press without his-clinking such as the play button to hear something before selecting it.
"2 lessons and then you have to pay to go farther, otherwise i would give it a better rating!"
love it so far but i wish i knew exactly what i'm saying as i'm looking at the pictures.
it does not start with alphabet or pronunciation.
i just got thrown into random conversations.
"sadly did not have the language i was looking to learn, but i can tell it is a very helpful and immersion program to learn a new language."
needs improvement in voice recognition.
very expensive.
i can log in on the web via my school webster but not the pp.
use too much time to download of unit.
pretty good wish it had does with it
i hate that you have to pay to get the full access
as a bit i have had to also learn american english.
the only problem i've come across is this weird pitch.
in the free pp you have 5 mistakes before you have to wait 4 hours to move on.
"some errors in the french learning module, however, that (according to question-specific message boards) have been outstanding for years, i.e."
i had no problem with this pp until i upgrade it to the latest version.
"while the introduction of the health system first ruined this pp, its worst consequences were now fixed and you can regain hearts by solving more difficult lessons."
it's a learning process and there has to be a little room for error.
they are only features on the computer version.
"that's a pity, because many times the first word is an article and identifying the gender is a challenging part in some languages."
with japanese i went to another pp that moves through the lessons more slowly but gives me a more solid rounding in things i really need to know better.
"my 25 day streak disappeared, and the cut moscow was left crying in my into."
"i am almost done with most of the levels available, not sure what happens next and if you need to pay to get to further levels."
i prefer to press on the words because it's quicker and my keyboard on my phone is not the best.
team domingo please give an update with essaying feature as soon as possible
"good free pp, as are a pain but can get rid of if you pay plus you can also get unlimited hearts, but if your like me and don't like paying for extra you can still learn extensively without a problem using the pp"
"awesome way to refresh a language, but i find that if you want to learn from scratch, you should supplement domingo with some other textbook or learning software."
it seems that the recent few updated made it work worst.
it very good learning apes but the in pp price is high pus make it 10$ for a month otherwise it's a good pp
"if i had no previous hebrew studies, this pp would not be very helpful."
"pretty good, wish i could get to the level in already at and go from there but the beginning stages are a good refreshed"
"i recommend learning in conjunction with an audit program to get additional speaking practise in (with makarin, it's all about the intonation)."
you never know if you are perceiving it wrong and therefore learning the language wrong.
"if using this pp, learn the words first on another pp but then use this one to practice those basis."
pretty good but i think it starts at a weird place ??
maybe it's made for people who already have some knowledge on the language.
i really like roseola stone because they teach you how you pronounce the words but i just wish that they gave you an actual schedule to follow that shows what you should do everyday because i have found some other things on the pp that i didn't even know were there or when to use them.
"my reason for not leaving 5 stars is because the pp and webster are so different, and i use both!"
"in high valyrian, the grammar explanations dont exist in pp, but do in the webster."
"in the pp you can ""break"" your completed lessons and restore them, but not in the webster."
"also in the pp, some lessons are longer/shorter than on the webster."
i'd like to get consistency
"organ for example it's more difficult for me, because i don't understand the characters so i make a lot of mistakes trying to guess the meaning and because i'm not premium, i waste hearts."
"i know that practicing you earn hearts, but in this way it's difficult to advance."
"the only ""practice"" these lessons have for the new characters is a match the character to the sound."
except it does not actually teach you what the words mean for a while.
"that's somewhat confusing, especially when it adds unknown words."
you have to guess what the phrases say to translate.
please work on translating english to arabic words a little more.
"sad to see the heart system in place, pushing people to opt for the plus option."
"perhaps if this option was cheaper, more would access the service."
"also, more explanation of why something is wrong would be very helpful."
it random throws in things like characters and sounds and words.
sometimes i'd forget what something means and have to wait for it to come back up when practicing rather than just looking at what it means.
"i am trying to learn russian and i'm only having issues with using the microphone to speak the words, i feels like i'm saying it properly but it says incorrect i just brush it off."
i would like to see if it could teach sign language or even bridle.
sometimes the voice audit is not brilliant.
"when i open the pp, it often says ""there was a problem with the connection"" even though my wife is fine and i can access other wife required applications just fine."
personally i would prefer more spoken challenges but otherwise a great pp!
"very good pp, good lessons design, balanced and very adjective, unfortunately like for other apes you need to pay to get unlimited time and avert free, but for beginning is more than you need, before you use all hearts its enough to learn the pp and decide if you want to buy premium, i will definitely, knowledge is priceless!"
i do think that do would benefit from teaching the letters or alphabet in the languages that use an alphabet.
"spanish, for example, has a limit on what you can learn per day, which doesn't exist on some other languages."
but the drawback of those uncommon languages is inconsistent audit clips.
some sound like they're from the inside of a tin can and are really hard to make out.
"i am learning chinese and japanese and domingo has taught me how to read, hear, and talk; however it didn't teach me how to write."
users are also not able to customize the theme of the pp or change the voices of narrators.
"on the bright side, tests are simple and beginner-friendly, but it won't allow you to be very proficient in the language you learn."
"it gives tips on each lesson module, but there are no external links embedded."
"i actually enjoy this pp quite a bit, the reason why i gave it four stars is because there was a pop-up advertisement that said if you got your friends to join that you would get a week of free unlimited access."
i got two of my friends to join which means i should have two weeks of unlimited access yet for whatever reason this does not appear to be the case.
pp crashed in the middle of the quit.
"once i restarted the pp, i'd lost the lights and need to use 5 more lights again."
"the only thing i think that would make the pp better is not only a translation, but a brief explanation of your error when you get something wrong."
"one suggestion is to have more tips, guideline especially when it comes to sentence construction."
"i am studying japanese now, and i have to regularly goose to understand some concepts (wa, ga, ka, etc)."
"there is a forum and while the comments are useful, i can't always filter which is exactly an ""opinion"" or an actual correct answer.."
my only issue is how hard they push the paid program.
it feels like the free pp is more of an advertisement/trial for the paid pp.
free pp has tons of advertisements.
"foi the sound won't play or the images won't show, but it's rare, and not unusual for a free pp."
the thing i really don't like is that there is no way to report these bags!
"a couple of things that would make it even better though; being able to look over past lessons for reminders if you haven't been on the pp for a while, and have some sort of vocal dictionary of all of the words you've learnt so far."
"i think if they made it so you could hear the sound of new words /phrases when they're presented it would help learn faster, in my opinion."
"also it would be beneficial if you could chat with others, perhaps someone that speaks the language you're learning to help get used to writing in a conversational manner and someone trying to learn our language could chat with us for practice too."
so happy to learn scottish garlic but the american english requires a level of translation for english.
"a bit buggy in the andros, how i was taught to pronounce things at garlic classes by native speakers in glasgow can be different as well as different phrases."
it might be better if you were put back a level or two once you've had a break.
however if there was more little virtual rewards for getting to particular levels i think it would be good.
"it can actually teach you a new language and does a great job encouraging you, but something that i want developer to add (please) is dark mode (because it's 2020 and only having light mode is quite outdated)."
"i'm taking an english-german course, and only half of the lessons have ""hints"" (which is actually required if you want to learn a language)."
"also, the hints on desktop are much more mature than the mobile ones"
not accepting one of two correct answers for the write what you hear questions.
overall helpful but sometimes new characters you haven't seen before are put in front of you when you have to figure out a complete statement.
i don't have the sound so i can't do the listening exercises.
"anyway, the microphone works and i have no problem with speaking parts."
"i wish there was more explanation about different endings to words, and an option to pay monthly for the service but will definitely keep using it."
"it's a very good pp, but i think u should add something has the ability to till us if our pronunciation is right or wrong and that would be perfect,one more thing, please add arabic language of’“"
fun and adjective but my mixed out learning topics keep breaking even if i got my streak and did lessons i come on later in the day and they all break.
voice for some exercises doesn't work and i can't do listening exercises... very bothering
"content is high quality, as are quite intrusively annoying but i guess they have to make money somehow, and the ad free option is way too expensive."
it would also be amazing if it was able to teach different kinds of sign language too!
"it's great, i just wish they would spend more time on verbs."
maybe have separate lessons where you learn just the verbs.
the mid doesn't work well and stops a lot.
small bags that hang up the shone but can easily switch to the computer to pass those (usually happens during a practice)
"it's an interesting pp to book my dutch,but i don't know why there is no voice in listening exercises!!!"
the pp' gives lots of revision of words i already know.
i don't think i get enough repetition of the things i fail on.
it's really good and helps me learn spanish very easy but the hearts are just annoying especially when you only have one left and you get a question wrong you can't save your progress of˜ž
"why has ""tips"" suddenly disappeared?"
each lesson segment used to have a tips section with basic into on that subject and it's just gone...
"i really like this pp, only problem is that it doesn't have my language in it sadly."
i'm hoping domingo will add some more languages in the future.
would be nice if they gave more definitions.
"it is great for brushing up in my chinese skill, but it was impossible to learn ukranian since i dont know the alphabet."
this new health system should be abolished.
"i prefer the former groups before you introduced these leagues, we normally compete in a group and complete challenges, that was more fun than this present league."
i really loved the pp but sadly these recent features are not reaching my satisfaction as a consumer.
newest update: 12.30.19 i don't know what happened but i can't use the speaking ability test.
"each time i tried to speak, the microfon suddenly turned off by itself."
"i've waited for an hour until the mid turn on again but the same things kept happened until i install it and re- download it, but nothing happened."
"it still the same, the mid won't work."
the only problem is that since you are learning something new you are going the make mistakes and the whole heart thing ruins that.
otherwise it should provide an opportunity to teach alphabet to earners.
"bow, from the second level i couldn't hear the voices."
"it was a very good experience for me learning french with domingo, until recently i have found a bothering problem with sounds, i'm reporting the problem of sound missing in every single exercise and it's still there."
"now i'm considering leaving domingo, without sounds playing it's more likely waste of time for me."
"too many interruption to the lessons, too much focus on bones based on gazing theory."
"main issue is the interaction of the pp with the phone keyboard and dictionary, an improvement would really help."
"it's utility is greatly lessened, however, by the frequently incompetent or confusing translations, which make it impossible to know what the rumania actually means."
"one annoying detail, is that the lessons accept the ""down arrow / new line"" button on the andros keypad as an alternate enter button, in addition to their ""check results"" button."
"since the ""new line"" button is right below the backspace button, i often submit an incorrect answer when i'm only trying to correct a type."
"i like the pp, it's just why do you only get a certain amount of hearts."
if you lose< how come you have to quit and lose all your progress.
my only complaints are i think the hearts should be unlimited.
i like learning spanish and i can't do that if it's limiting me on how many mistakes i'm allowed to make.
and when i do the speaking test i'm positive i'm saying it right and it doesn't process right sometimes and i loose a heart.
"but what i don't like is that i have to wait like 5 hours for 1 heart, so you can't really make mistakes when that's part of learning a new language."
i think we should get more hearts like 5 hearts in an hour.
only lost a star as i think it would be helpful to have a section on phrases you will need on travelling to italy earlier on which i personally would have found reassuring.
"good with basis, but you would have thought the as pay for the lessons, bit you have to get these heart things which discourages you from learning."
i wish they had something that explains the tense of words it really would be helpful.
"i also hate that when your out of hearts you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can play again, unless you accumulate them through practice runs."
it's a great pp but sometimes the hints don't exactly help you with questions.
plus some languages don't have the tips section.
i'm learning russian and there is no tips page so i have to assume what the ending of the noun is.
there's also not much content regarding what you can spend your lights on.
"would love a range of outfits to motivate me to earn more lights, or a house!"
would also love that to be available.
unfortunately doesn work well put of good wife bones - clashes and fails to work on g
sadly enough you can't start at a higher level
"however, for learning arabic, i would tread with caution, as the lessons have a bad habit of mixing modern standard arabic with dialect arabic, which should never be done."
looks great but it didn't have that.
"it frequently freeze, and random doesn't record my progress."
there also seems to be issues singing between the webster and the pp.
"i would like to see the stories on the pp, not just the site."
and it would be nice to be able to collapse the lessons once you pass a checkpoint.
all that strolling is tedious.
:) and a vocal review.
"the only downside is that it does not explain rules or basis, so the approach is really intuition (a guessing game sometimes, and left to your interpretation of the rules as you go along in learning translations)."
would be good if they had a reference portion if you want to understand grammar rules.
"the only reason it is not 5 stars is one of the voices has too thick an accent to hear properly, and it is only on guess work that i get the words and phrases correct when her voice is used."
"being dutch, it is interesting to use this pp but often very frustration, particularly with computer voices that race through a sentence with the consequence of misunderstanding the words."
"the translations into english are often strange to my ears, obviously 'dictionary translations' and not in english vernacular, having unusual placement of nous and verbs."
"the dutch is often extra long minded, not simple to translate, even for me."
"i have a couple of suggestions: 1) the sentences are never too complicated and they rarely used vocabulary from previously completed lessons; 2) in the word selection pool most of the time the first word has a capital letter, which makes it too easy to identify."
"for new languages however, i'd like for there to be writing included."
"i can type in the spanish, but for the organ and japanese there isn't even tracing."
"when it works.of¤¦â€â™€ï¸ for those having office courses not downloading, i just cleared my data under the domingo pp in settings and it fixed my issue."
"i had to log back in, but at least it was better than waiting a week for a response from their team (that never happened)."
"besides this one bug and no email response of¤·â€â™€ï¸, the pp is great."
"the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the speaking portions; i'm taking organ, so i don't know if the other languages are like this, but the lady talks way too fast."
"there's no option for her to speak more slowly, or to say the sentence in parts."
it'd be helpful if you could practice the sentence in parts more slowly before trying to repeat the whole thing.
will you be adding barque to the list at some time?
"4 stars only because i would like to see a feature whereby it listens to my pronunciation, which roseola stone does have."
"for example, in a ""match the pairs"" part of the italian portion, it asks to match the english words with their italian translation."
"very good, only want to communicate casually, annoying to be punished for minor spelling mistakes but otherwise can't complain at all."
"i love this pp, it should start full conversations though."
"( completing the circles, etc) but it's too pick about minor spelling errors."
you have to keep tying a whole long complicated sentence over and over because of one or two small errors.
the more complicated grammar is equally frustration.
the more different grammar needs to start with simple tasks rather than whole sentence translations.
some of the achievements are begged.
"however i've already completed the league, and did not get the achievement."
"great pp, but please fix your achievements."
"the way domingo reaches is great; however, the pp is increasingly adding paywalls and is taking most user interactivity away."
"clubs, which were a good way for users to learn from each other if kept active, were discontinued, and leaderboards replaced them."
"leaderboards make people more competitive, but there's no way to root for each other or learn about others so that they are more than just numbers..."
"root voices for spoken french, japanese, and german makes it difficult to know if pronunciation accurate but is a relatively ok stand-in for humans speaking."
grammar lessons would be a very welcome addition.
actually it would be great if it didn't have the problems that it has now  for example the women don't talk anymore or the listening won't be listened or error to load a lesson and so on.
"however, there are some minor changes i would like to see: 1. please make it harder to pass the test (i have never failed once) 2. please add drawing characters in different languages (not just choosing) otherwise, it's a wonderful free application with only a 2-second ad at the end of each lesson."
sometimes the sound files are broken and also if the english translation isn't exactly as the have it the answer will be marked wrong.
the german language pp is more complete than the japanese pp.
"however, the as are very annoying and you only get so many chances to get the answers right or you have to wait until the next day."
"i find that there is no explanation of words before hand, you're left to figure it out on your own."
you also have to spell correctly to complete challenges.
its more of a bunch of quires than a relaxed learning experience.
"i rate this four stars instead of five because although it's very helpful, most of the sentences they teach you, you wouldn't need to know or they are things that you wouldn't normally say."
"i think they should teach you basic sentences that you would use everyday rather than something like ""lots of young men live in america"" or something similar to that."
"besides my journey, there is one thing bother me and it is the hearts."
it would be a lot more fun if i didn't have to wait four hours for at least one heart.
"you need to do lots of practices, and spend more than 5-10 minutes a day or you won't learn much !"
would be great if it had a speaking only option and a written option as i feel speaking it is more important than reading mostly.
"one drawback for me is, (in italian) the lessons aren't comprehensive."
"three or four verbs are introduced (sometimes without all the conjugates, which makes irregular verbs difficult), but the exercises will ask for dozens of verbs that weren't introduced."
"while it's a great pp (and i use it enough to use the paid version), i still need a notebook to write down and learn verbs with all their conjugates, along with all the glances of the language."
the lessons could stand to explain certain things a little better though.
like each lesson should have a little into that lays out what will be covered.
i would like it much better if there is an option to turn the writing portion of the language you are trying to learn off.
just needs more words in every category possible :) thanks
i noticed that you don't learn the alphabet yet.
it feels slow paced as i expand my french vocabulary.
but now i am very disappointed in the lack of lessons.
you would get up to 20 lessons at the higher levels which is good for retention as repetition is key but now you only get 4 for each level and that is ridiculous.
"ok, this pp is a great free language-learning pp, but i just feel like it doesn teach you correctly sometimes in the exercises, and it doesn't give you too many tips during the lesson either."
so if you have the patience and willing to dig for some answers when it marks you wrong (even though 90% of the comments from other users on the pp show that your answer was the same as theirs) you might really enjoy this pp.
"i wish the lesson would explain a little more, but the community is so friendly and willing to teach it makes up for the lack of content in the lessons."
"i really love the pp except for one piece, the health."
"i get they are trying to push the premium service, but the webster doesn't employ this feature and i can learn all day."
but if you get into a lesson you struggle with on the pp your health can run out before even completely finishing a single lesson.
the reason i don't give it 5 stars is because grammar rules aren't explained you just learn how to say things in other languages.
"in the scottish garlic, for example, the mention rules aren't explained properly."
"the incentive to practise leagues regularly are mostly positive, except for the 'leagues' feature."
can run a bit slowly on my phone.
"the occasional bug making lessons impassable, very rare, i've only seen them in practise mode"
"but the errors, the lack of some vital information while learning and the pure translation-focus of the pp takes away from the learning experience in my opinion."
"but, maybe it will be kind lots of as and makes you send some money on the better version."
i hope do further develops 'stories' to help with immersion.
"the reason i took off one star is because it's a little straight forward, and when you're still learning the alphabet or something, the next thing is something you've never seen before."
i also don't like the lives/hearts and how you have to wait to refill them.
"please, i can do audit lessons."
he cannot start recording somehow.
"and please, add a lesson to learn the symbols of the language, letters, anti, etc."
"i love it so much and it helped me a lot learning a new language but the"" hearts "" take a very long time to refill that lead me to quit the pp and i wish u would look at this matter and make it better!!"
"i wish the progress was faster, but the pace seems related to my demonstrated proficient."
the only thing missing is some explanation of theory.
"love this pp, it's very useful for learning all types of different languages, it's very useful because i am using it for school, i just wish you didn't have to pay to get more unlimited hearts, or just make it so you have more hearts, beside that it's a great pp."
"has helped me for sure, but small criticism would be that it is overlay repetition."
"repetition bread familiarity, but i feel it can be too repeititve."
perhaps an algorithm to measure how many times you got something right or wrong could be used to progress quick earners more quickly?
"superb but try to avoid repeating the same sentences in the same lesson several times, it becomes very boring in fact, try to use the words you want me to learn in different sentences to avoid making anyone feel boring, and one more thing, each lesson have many levels, try to make each level is especial and make me feel that i learned new thing even a new sentence"
i love using dueling but sometimes it takes so much to load the lessons and sometimes it can load them:(
problems with timing of the speech function makes me miss words on the pp that i didn mispronounce
the latin course forces you to an english sentence structure for translations.
"i like the pp, but honestly the passive aggressive modifications get on my nerves."
if you skin a day the modifications get sappy.
at times want hear any of the audit but it might be the fact that i have a happy phone otherwise great pp.
"but i think the process is a bit slow :/ waaaayyy tooooo slooowwwww that instead of pushing myself to learn, i get bored and annoyed."
there is a lot of repetition in the lessons which seems to limit the amount of new words that could be introduced under each category.
its mainly learning vocabulary and not verb conjunction.
occasionally have issues with lessons loading up and there have been a couple of the speaking questions that wouldn't accept your answer unless it was in english but all in all it's a good pp.
"it doesn't do much to explain some of the santa and the voice speaks too quickly when you do some of the audit tests but for a free pp this is very, very good."
"the pp is enjoyable to use and motivation, but you need to get a book with some grammar in to understand the rules of the language"
silly types can get annoying but overall awesome product
teaching methods are great but please add rude to the languages taught.
"also, if the tips contained a list of all the vocabulary taught in lesson for memorizing it would also help (ex: for japanese, all the letters with their pronunciation)."
"a fun way to learn, however the pp could use a glossy of words you've learned, as well as a proper pronunciation guide."
"i can copy the voice perfectly, yet the pp still won't register that i've said it correctly."
"it's a good start for a new language, but the audit seems to cut out for no reason periodically."
there are times when i must select words and i can't because they don't fully appear on the screen.
it lacks a bit of depth to explore the grammar or actual dialogue to listen to and learn from.
"if you get like 5 wrong on a lesson and you don't have domingo plus well ,your heart will have no lives and you'll have to wait 4 hours and about 23 minutes."
lessons sometimes start without giving you enough information such as using words not previously taught.
would be nice to have a vocal library to keep track of words you've learned so far.
i wish it let you practice the so each part more.
"it's has helped me learn the basis so far, but the only small complaint i have is knowing how to resume where i left off in the lesson."
i would say the pp isn't well organized in the home screen.
could say don't like the whole set up and everything for leveling and act ..
"nice application, very interactive, but i would have loved it more if we could possibly be able to do an online quit competition with our friends, would be nice."
however i have encountered stitches and reported it but never received any sort of response.
"the pp interface is awesome, but for some languages like makarin, i feel that it is not beginner friendly."
it's more of an intermediate practice for people who already know the basis in my opinion
i love this pp but i find one fault in it that i couldn't talk to native speaker .
my only suggestion is to design better contents for the lesson you work on and some more detailed explanations as to why the answer is right or wrong
"i love the pp and it reaches me a lot, but i am still learning a language and whenever i get a word wrong i lose health points and you have to do a lesson and get them all right to earn back health points."
i gave it 4 stars because i don't really like the idea of hearts i think you should be able to just keep on learning rather than being forced to pay Â£60 a year for infinite hearts
con: would like to see explanations of grammar.
"however, because we have to have hearts, it slow down learning progress."
"domingo, please can you stop the hearts as they let down your pp."
the pp is great but sometimes the voice just stops working
i just have a hard time hearing the sounds.
"i use a phone and tablet, phone pp has more oral exercises."
as an australian some of the american usage is frustration in translation.
"it is a good pp to learn languages but lately it has problem doubling the lights, it supposedly to watch the adv for few seas but turns out the screen goes all black and stuck."
just that there are some specific languages which could be involved like martha but other than that it is all awesome.
what i hate is that you have to complete the day's lesson by midnight in order to maintain your streak.
"issue is, i cannot add my friend so that we can track each other's progress."
"the hearts are a bit annoying, and i wish the pp wasn't so push for you to get pro, but otherwise it's great."
i do wish there was a tax for explanations of things like why the same word can be spelled different ways.
"i also appreciate the i, the only thing is i wish the domingo podcasts had a tax in the pp rather than a separate webpage."
"really great pp for free use, but they may need to review some of the rumania phrases."
would've been great if you add latin.
and also add an option wherein you look for someone to chat in order to practice your language.
"and yeah, can you add a feature where we can save tips office?"
it just dont have many explanations for the usage of words.
might be useful if they put how a word is used in grammar properly.
i think it could and should be one of the apes that you don't need to connect to internet for it will be nice for that otherwise great for kiss and adults.
"somewhat repetition, but can move forward easily."
should be some explanation of towel usage.
"lessons move along a bit quick for me, need more time to learn the symbols(letters) new words are not well expressed before expecting you to know them."
however i gave it a four because of way too many adds however i recommend you download of˜‰
amazing pp but sometimes the formulation of the sentences seem weird and also in some cases they ask you to translate something and it is just a name that you have to write like : hallo hans > hello ...
it is sad that there is no feature to switch the default language.
"my first language is russian but my phone is set to english, so the pp is also in english which makes it really inconvenient to learn."
"it's so useful but i have a major problem, none of the listening tracks play on my phone so i can't answer them, by the way i gave all the permission, what should i do?"
this is very nice but my only problem is i can't find friends.
i notice that some things aren't explained clearly.
"a few things here and there that aren't exactly translated right, but i'd like to think it's more of a difference in dialect."
why suddenly the pp became unstable?
"it masses up up points, days, the number of lessons done and leagues."
i do not have access to listening and speaking tasks...
"great pp, but it would be perfect if you'd add the grammar explanations and stories in the other languages besides german, french, english etc."
i do wish it would challenge me a little faster though.
"but in learning arabic the font of assignment is very small, difficult to read, especially for a beginner."
.....except that sometimes has problem with its audit system.
"the sound doesn't work properly most of the times unfortunately˜¹, unless the application is awesome"
would be easier though if there was european portuguese because it's not the same as brazilian.
after the last update the pp sometimes doesn' t count your progress.
also in somehow losing the gems by no means.
good pp.... i would prefer if the pp had an explaining feature towards grammar/vocal so i could better understand why the words are in the order that they are etc.
i updated my pp but there is no sound for vocal quires when u tape the sound tape
"great pp, really helpful of˜‰ don't think the hearts are necessary though."
"it's a good pp for learn basic vocabulary, but it's just work on the beginner level."
"for some reason they make a louse japanese course, not even covering all the hiring and giving zero lessons for katakana which is essential to learning japanese... you need to have some kind of rd party study aid for these and other asia courses if you want to learn them in depth and not just play a game (>.>) be it a text book, character chart, etc, which is totally unnecessary."
"there are better apes for asia but if you're interested in a european language, this application is a must have!"
"pretty good, except the first time i download it, i disabled it because it wasn't working very good..."
domingo is a great pp for learning a new language but you have to pay in order to continue learning without any interruption like hearts or as.
"good pp, just takes too long to get to an intermediate/senior level for when you already know basis and want to learn more complex sentences."
just wish it had dark mode for those late night sessions before bed.
"it didn't didn't hello with grammar, just sentence structure."
i love this pp but but there are some things i don't like about this pp.when i get things wrong my heart goes down and later i have none so its hard to play sometimes.
"the pp is great and i'm learning 2 languages at one time, but the adds are a little ridiculous at times."
"it's a little childish, and i wish i was learning more useful language for traveling, but i bet that'll come."
might be better if the developer add some more exercises to practice speaking.
good pp but does not explain the grammar rules.
requires a little research outside of the pp to progress in some of the lessons.
mixed voices.
get annoyed with the rewards though.
pp wont work with andros device?
"- samson galaxy 8 i'd love to provide a 5 star review, but as technical support doesn't seem to be able to get my account to work on andros devices (which is what i have) i can use the product i purchased."
same here the program today started to pitch i cannot access my plan.
i had to sign in again and looks like all my progress saved is gone.
"also the audit was struggling to use either with wired headphones, bluetooth or just my phone microphone."
it's stuck in office mode.
"excellent, but needs an option to rest all lessons, not just one at a time which is too cumbersome when wanting to start after a period away"
in the past you could slow the pronunciation.
mostly good only issue that i'm having is occasionally the pp/ or phone is not picking up what i say
a little prices but helps a lot.
i'd say getting a brand new phone or using a good microphone would indefinitely help.
"i only wish that it would explain the grammar more, as in why the grammar is different i certain situations."
it's a bit frustration when it doesn't recognize the word i'm trying to say though.
good pp for learning but it costs a lot .
a four only in that it is immersion and having a tough time connecting the dots.
some hints on purity and fiction in early stages might help in particular with non-neuro based language.
"easy to learn, good for beginners but would be good if you didn't need to repeat activities if you got them all correct in the core activities!"
i love the experience and the ability to learn from this pp the only thing i wish was different is for there to be a way to earn more lessons or even just the ability to get the lessons cheaper.
the voice recognition needs improvement though.
it is very good but all of it needs to be free.
communication should be free!
but i wish you let your users try until they get it correct.
wish i could repeat it over and over to ensure retention.
very good but its a bit annoying u have to pay
i am not able to find the option to change from beginner to intermediate on my pp.
the audit analysis is great at telling you when you've not pronounced a word correctly however it's not great at helping you improve.
"great pp, bit expensive and it is limited in that once you've done the 20 units that's it, nothing more."
i think you need both as grammar isn't really explained.
tried to sign up on their webster but due to some pitch could subscribe.
contracted customer service but what seemed to me an automatic reply.
overall pp is good but expensive and limited.
"a bit on the expensive side, but if you can get a half price deal i'd say it's worth it."
one criticism is that the reading lessons in unit one are so ridiculously easy they feel like a waste of time
"i made an account for the japanese unit and my only issues is sometimes, the voice lessons don't work and you have to start the pp."
the other issue is that you can only do unit 1 without paying money.
"i got it to learn more english well and work on my pronunciation, so far i think it is working, the only down side is that you can't log onto another device until you log out in your other device."
i use this pp with my lawton the most and there has been instances where i forgets to log out and can't use the pp during my lunch at work on my phone or tablet.
i don't like that it can't be opened on multiple devices.
most certain to speaking.
"unless you have a professional level microphone, it will tell you that you failed the first time, but upon saying the word or phrase a second time, it will say you got it 100% correct."
"i do wish there was more help with pronunciation, like if i get a word wrong repetitively, i'd like to be given the option for extra physics help."
"i use domingo along with this, because being able to write(type) out words helps me learn them and that is one thing this pp is missing."
"also would be nice to have a ""general grammar rule"" section to reference for help."
"i like it a lot and it is really helpful to visualized and pronounce these words, but without telling you the definitions it can be difficult."
but some lessons seem not optimized for phone size as pictures seem too small or his allied with caution bubbles.
also seems to miss some of the desktop apes features like character selection.
for japanese there did not seem to be a way to tongue to only hiragana and karagina.
i wish they also translated what it all meant weather just have us guess ??
the only reason the pp is not five stars is because every once in a while it won't register my voice.
so i either fail or have to say a phrase or word multiple times for it to register.
"i do feel like the multiple choice makes it easy to make educated guesses, but maybe it works out in the long run."
i seem to have some issues though between singing.
"every time i open the pp it says congratulations on finishing week, even though i'm on week 3. there's a button that takes me to my latest though so it's not too much of a bother, but still weird."
the speech recognition is spot though.
"more interactive, work on conversation actually saying the words, like the speaking analyse so know saying it right."
just need to have short note why something right or wrong answer in grammar.
the program has a difficult time with speech recognition during exercises requiring me to respond verbally.
"but it'd be better if there were basic alphabet of the languages, plus, the words' translation (from pictures) into our selected native language."
recognition skill develop quickly but pronunciation skill need more work.
i am learning vietnamese some of the words don't mean the same thing.
it said that ong and ba is an older man or woman but i was corrected and told it's elderly man or woman.
it would be better for me if it focused on recreational words and phrases since my trip is for fun not business but it works
having a slight issue with the speech recognition but overall i love the new format.
some thumbnail photo are too small to be easily understood on a phone screen.
"good simple bite size learning you can fit around your day, hard to work out if the voice recognition issues are my microphone or the software."
"great pp, little prices but worth it!!!"
4 stars only because the mobile doesn't include noweigen as an option yet!
"works pretty well on the mobile pp, just the occasional issue having to repeat into the mid."
would like more of a word to picture game for beginners.
i started using this pp to learn japanese for travel but i'm having issues fully understanding it just because it doesn't actually directly translate and tell me what each word means
seems to have trouble picking up my accent/tone.
i get some pronunciation correct but it says i did not.
"the teaching method is great, my only complaint is that there's not an easy way to review if you get out of the habit of studying."
"would like to see the games available via pp on the pp; otherwise, works as described!"
"very good, albeit phone mid sometime gets drowned out by fan and other common absent noise"
"i love it except that the accuracy bar doesn display when you reply words your struggling with, with make me struggle more."
sometimes voice detection hangs/laws making me repeat the phrase or word.
too much anti for the first lesson.
prefer more hiragana and katakana.
i turned off the microphone and now it doesn't enable it anymore.
singing between multiple devices needs to get a little better but overall good
this is a good language pp but it takes too long to load.
"i say the words, and it says, i said it wrong, ink what that's all about."
good pp sometimes laws behind and appears to get stuck occasionally but otherwise very useful
its done and kind fun but i really wish it could have nothing but argentina accent... but fun may to learn spanish...like i wish i could have an argentina setting a know
awesome so far but wish it had more free content.
some of the pictures are hard to make out.
other than the price of subscription it's perfect
excellent except the voice recognition is touch
its great the the words need to be pronounced more clearly!
doesn't really give the translation
although a great pp i wish it wasn't so expensive :(
pretty good for learning vietnamese although some prior knowledge of the language may be necessary
"it's too fast for a novice..please allow more time on pronunciation and grammar other than that, it's rrrr-eat!"
right now a four just started simple but still a little slow when learning spanish
lost progress on phone.
i wish i could clock the full version but it is too expensive.
i need to log in every lesson
doesn't have all the features/lessons web does
i think this pp should add the meanings of the words before letting us say them
"it's slow, but fun."
good program but more like guessing game.
doesn't teach what i am exactly saying or grammar santa etc.
sometimes i put in an answer that should be accepted but it's not for some reason that happens once in ~150 questions or so.
in all honesty the adds get annoying.
quick update: i wish it told you how many minutes and hours total you have been practicing.
"when i lose all my lives, i just want to keep going!"
don't know what happened though but after one of the recent updated i can't recorder the words in word bank mode anymore.
also the tests to skin a level are sometimes too easy with most translations providing the word bank!
(wish there was a portuguese from italian!
it's really adjective and if you are competitive person you have to be careful.
"but one thing, i wish japanese lessons had stories, it would make everything so much more interesting!"
but i would like to make a suggestion: it would make it very simple for me at least if there was a dictionary of the language i'm learning in the pp.
"learning with this interactive environment beats all other methods in my opinion, and i wish that domingo would take the lessons to even more advanced levels as well."
"one extra plus is the sensible approach to audit support: when audit is not a good idea, you can practice with text only."
"can't be used by itself for language learning, but as a supplement it is my favorite pp."
"this pp is very helpful i am in the process of learning two languages french and welsh but as any apes need improvement i would like to change two things 1:having more life 2: a word bank for you chosen languages for example once completing a lesson the words from there go into a ""dictionary"" which will help for memory and revision thanks for reading this and creating domingo!"
"not bad for a beginner to learn a language, but i think you should add more relatively content to he language between people in the streets, the words that the people use in their daily life, although, it's a perfect application, keep it up !"
my one grip is i wish there was more verbal feedback so i can here what i'm learning.
they do give tips for why you got a question wrong are too few.
you should also use a dual language dictionary and books in your target language.
another great help would be a totally immersion experience and/or a native language speaker.
"the program is great, but the sound of pronunciation and repetition of words after the basic stage is mute and the practice of repeating the words has become difficult."
pus add more items in the store because i'm losing my motivation after buying everything.
wish you could always make them repeat the sentences or words even after having correct answer.
this pp is great but lately it's had a bug i guess and its voice does not work.
you can't hear anything and this is such a summer because i really liked this pp.
i wish that it had more explanations for things and also that it had a way of looking back at a bank of all the words you've learned.
i would be willing to pay a one off fee for unlimited but not monthly.
"some sentences are a bit silly (eg ""i'm not an apple"") but overall could only recommend."
"it's a great pp, it's a masterpiece and i guess the pp was really planned very well, but please you guns should add the feature where we can chat with other followers in different languages from different countries."
"it's awesome but recently the sound doesn't work, i think it's just in my country, ran,that's a pity, i hope it will come back,it's impossible to continue with out the true pronunciation!"
"lately,i can load the audit,but not always,when i have to hear a sentence and write it down,it just doesn't play the audit,or for new words,i dont know what to do!"
but some tips on pronouncing would be helpful.
my kindly request to add arabic and rude language course and also the stories (for reading) and dictionary option in the application.
"makes learning languages easy, unless it uses a different alphabet."
however recently the listening exercises have been quite unclear.
but i can log in to my previous act just i left it a few weeks later.
the constant as for the upgrade of this pp keep begging me though.
"if there was only one complaint, although it's not really that, it's just the word i'm using, it's that they just throw larger words and pronunciation at you without warning while you're still doing the simplest pronunciation."
sounds don't play since the last update.
i have to clear ache every time before every lesson.
it would be nice though if you could delete courses on your phone too instead of only on a computer.
the only complaint i have is that the lights feel a little useless.
"my biggest complaint for japanese specifically is that there are lessons for hiragana, but we're kind just thrown straight into katakana and anti."
i should also mention that some of the phrases that we learn in japanese are extremely rarely used by native speakers (according to hellotalk friends).
the sound of course don't work properly.
all of them get mute during the tests!
it would be cool if it had a dark theme though.
"excellent way to learn a foundation for a language, but it has to be accompanied by immersion."
"in going to be honest right now this game is boring,i never really enjoyed it and couldn really use it for long until i got bored but with the new update i love it!the update has new stories and they are always fun and entertaining and come with twists!now i love using this pp and have no problem get a few stories every day!this makes me happy because i can have fun and learn a new language at the same time!5 stars love it!"
only things i'd want would be a cool to section where you can like read through a bunch of different tips for each section instead of just one but overall i love it
"however, there is one small bug-the voice recognition questions are lenient to the point where while learning french someone said something in hind in the background and it said that it was correct."
"however, i wish they had a few more languages and sometimes the audit doesn't work on some devices, despite turning it on."
"one thing others me, however... the as."
make it easier to close as please.
"my only complaint is that for spanish it can't understand me when i say ""no, do, tres"" even though i'm pronouncing it correctly - i've had my boyfriend whose first language is spanish try and it can't understand him either; it's just a pitch."
i wish there could be some back and forth dialogue.
only problem is when u r using it for free you see the as interfering.
"the only problem i have, is that the competitive banking are so large, it's a list cause to try."
first has 1500. so placing high is pretty difficult.
using the hearts to learn is a little disadvantaging when they run out but basically it's an impressive pp.
i was a bit disappointed with the costumes for do.
is there a way to show do in their costumes when the pp loads and when lessons load?
"your ""hey goose"" ad is obnoxious loud with the bearing trumpet."
i hate the as after every lesson.
"i don't like that grammar isn't particularly taught, just suddenly introduced in a lesson for practice."
in not necessarily saying they should give books out just suggest easy to read books in the language the learner is desiring to learn.
would enjoy seeing more achievements or game like features in the future
"yet, one thing wrong is in the spanish lessons you learn to put in sometimes-unnecessary things."
"the only thing i need to say is there shouldn't be an option to remove modifications because since i removed modifications i lost inspiration to learn, but i'm starting again!"
i only wish the quires were progress based.
it would be greater if the pp does not stop sending modifications after a few days and maybe a little bit of change concerning the content of the notifocations would be greater as well.
"although its an awesome language learning pp, but sometimes during in any particular section of language, it goes few steps ahead without the person who is learning having any clue for it, so i would just like to suggest that, it would be nice if you make or sections easier and dont advance rapidly to another step without clearing up all the previous doubts"
exceptional but though the letters are bit confusing in terms of survive or book type.
"the only complaint is, apart from italy and rome, the use of mostly i american place names, which won't ever come up in classic or ecclesiastical latin literature, which is what i at want to be able to read eventually."
would be great if there are more advanced levels of learning.
"it'll be better that can connect with friends live, such as live chats, audit calls.from that we can resolve our language matters with natives."
"but should show the translation of the words you are asked to recognise by sound, as is meaningless if you don't know what they are...and goose doesn't or can't translate either, as that's not that good either!"
currently am unable to hear the choice of sounds at the start of each lesson.
"the audit description comes through fine, but the four option are not spoken once pressed."
for beginners i strongly recommend that you click the lightbulb before starting a lesson test.
one of the favourite apes in my phone.
the grammar is a bit funny.
"the only ""bad point"" is the lack of explanation, so i would say that if you are really planning to learn, it's a side tool :)"
my only area of regret with the system is the abuse of extra points.
the only improvement i could think of is to add the actual alphabet and what sounds each letter makes for that language.
one thing that i would like to say is that you should also make us do more oral practice.
"*there is a ""heart/error"" system in the pp."
the only thing i would change in domingo is background colour.
"however, you have to take it upon your self to broaden your vocabulary."
"currently using the free service, with the odd month premium here and there to give some support."
unfortunately i wouldn't be able to afford a whole year even though i think it's a wonderful resource that i hope continues to encourage people to learn.
"the mobile version has a limit of five hearts if you dont get premium, but if you have a computer i found that there is no hearts taken away if you make a mistake."
definitely should use headphones so you can get the infections right.
)i'd like to see some culture thrown in to learn about.
")additional materials like literature or video, that will be optional."
"the only thing i would change about it is the practice quires, they don't go over things you've already learned."
"the plus version is a little prices, but definitely worth it!"
its a very go pp for learning other language..but there should not be too much ad..
"first of all i have to thank you for this amazing pp.it really works for me.but i have a small problem ,the voices don't work,so i miss a major part of it.can you fix it please?"
"â˜†update, i'm in ruby and yet it's still showing in in sapphire?"
"my only issue is that i wish it would let users type in japanese for said lessons (in the mobile pp), but it's a small issue that doesn't diminish the rating i'm giving it"
i would include a very breakdown lesson before reach new verb to show the differences.
"great pp, but it has problem after the last update, at first it was good sound and pronunciation but now all gone i mean no sound!"
no pronunciation!of˜¥ why?
"i'd still recommended lessons of some kind, as you can't always find a good explanation of why an answer is what it is."
though i would prefer more explanations why certain words are used in different contents.
i really like this pp but regarding the dealing plus i'm a ll bit disappointed u guns already have as but why u should make us pay to be able to learn office too?
"i think there is be an option that allows users to connect with people, perhaps a chat option."
the only problem i have is that it's teaching me how to translate german into english more than it reaches me how to translate english into german but that could be because i just haven't gotten far enough.
i didn't update the pp because i've heard it makes it a lot harder to learn with the heart system
would love to see gaidhlig and man on here.
"significant repetition in the lessons is helpful for derbies, but intermediate will want to skin most early levels."
one feature would be great add-on is option to review some of the completed lessons as refreshed.
the only thing is that after buying the do skins and some other things you end up with a lot of lights without any purpose.
maybe you guns could add more skins or some other things?
and live talking with other spanish people would be nice!
sometimes it is a little too rigid on the spelling of the new language but overall i am enjoying the pp!
"the only thing that i want to mention is , not all the people from around the world can learn english by this pp because there are some limited languages as the helping language for learning english not including first.thank again for this amusing pp."
i experienced occasionally a pitch where it cancers your day streak.
i just wish there where more choice on regions of some languages!
"i'm learning italian, and i need to learn calabrian italian but there only regular italian!"
"the lessons are also challenging and and of fun, but it would be nice if maybe there was a list of the vocabulary and maybe an explanation of how the grammar works somewhere."
"please add finnish,cantonese,northern s¡mi and iceland lesson for english speakers!"
but what happen to the percentage bar that let us know how client in spanish or different language we were.
"i just wish it would stay at the same level each time i go on it, instead of not knowing where i was last time i used it."
i have lots of gems but nothing i can buy anymore.
please add more items in your shop.
if possible i would like to see group chat added.
i don't have a way to communicate on a daily to apply the languages i'm learning.
there are many complaints about domingo slamming you when you break your streak.
sometimes the sentences are too long.
there is something need to be fixed about grammar of some languages.
"dont help with speaking, but learning to read, top notch"
can there please be a dark mode option.
"i use do everyday when i wake up and go to bed and it's a little rough on my eyes, to have that much white light."
"it wont teach me how to speak british-, could you change that please?"
pp is fantastic as if you run out of hearts to get more to try and move ahead you have to do a practice section so improving your skill further.
"this is a great pp, although the hearts run out quickly and i think they take too long to refill :)"
"in fact i am using it for almost 1 year, but something is missing, the filipino language, you should add that wonderful language, and filipino ay sang magandang wiki, message from your filipino user‡µðŸ‡­of‡µðŸ‡­"
"i would, however love to learn dovahzul (from the elder schools series)."
"my only real frustration with this is if i'm having trouble with a certain lesson and need to practice it further, it hardly ever pulls up anything from that lesson in the practice section."
i wish there was some way to flag specific things so you can practice your troubled areas more.
"unfortunately there is no description to what level is reached , so i haven made up my mind whether to pay for a full subscription"
demonetization could be better.
please add persian.
just needs more items and accessories for do in the item shop.
"good pp for language learning.. though there r some bags in some exercises, so i think u should add an option to tell about those bags cause they stop the learning progress"
"it's great, but you should get more than 5 hearts at a time."
"just don't know why i hear the speeches with very long delays, as of late."
"the the heart is annoying, but i understand it is an encouragement."
the heart system is puts everything at a halt when you run out?
so i say the words in the language but don't know what they mean.
every time i try and load the page i get booted straight to the results page where i am told that i didn't achieve the pass mark.
if by some chance i manage to get to open the limestone section i get booted to the end results page and again am told that i didn't pass without being given the opportunity to complete the section.
loved it i am learning organ through the pp but you need to know the basis of language to go on with it fortunately i am aware of the basis
"if it want for the priceless of the program i'd learn many languages but for now on a single mothers budget, i'll stick to the ones actually needed in my area."
i am a bit annoyed about the filling.
they straight up charged me 100$ for the year instead of the monthly rate every year.
takes a few to understand their lesson plan but it's set up extremely well.
though pictures hard to tell boy from girl something
"this is really good for learning languages, but if your dedicated and really want to learn, i would suggest doing other things along with this."
"like listen to music in the language you want to learn, podcasts, couture lids, also domingo."
"side note, i already had some knowledge of the language, so that made it a little easier for me."
"also, it'd be wonderful if such exercises were to accept any response offered using correct grammar and vocabulary, not just canned responses."
i recommend this pp for dedicated adult earners.
it's a fantastic application but they have to tell us the meaning of the application and at the same time the application have to tell us what is the word mean in the sentence in what we're saying because we're saying it we does we don't exactly know what the picture is describing it's putting a man with a couple inside it's like a miniature can a cup or many people are drinking a cup i don't actually really understand it very well so like any time details to choose to language example first
it would be nice if you didn't have to pay to get the best experience but it is one of the best language learning apes i have had.
"please, fix the click button on top screen."
"it's a very good learning language apes, but boooooy... it's pretty expensive for me."
"at first i was a bit frustrated as you only had three tries at pronunciation, but, it really helps you learn things faster and focus."
"only issue i see is when the microphone is disabled to practice pronunciation, i would still like to be able to stay on the screen before it automatically jumps to the next."
"i've found one they flaw - and that is you need total silence for verbal exercise, if there a sire in the distance or even if you have your to on low, it struggles to differentiate."
"really have appreciated the pp... although, the link to subscribe isn't allowing to cancel my subscription..."
"what i found weird was the fact that it started with phrases directly and the writing is in greek, so if you have no idea regarding the greek alphabet, that's donna be tricky."
"after multiple failed attempts, changing the voice recognition (still x), pronunciation difficulty (still x), it was my speed (correct!"
"the word teaching, however, is a bit slow."
the pp can be more effective by teaching more words instead of having the user go through some of the exercises over too frequently.
"the pp wants you to repeat the syllables, the voice pronounced syllables as it is spoken but the pp shows the word break down."
"voice pronounced ë¨¸ ê±° of”, pp shows ë¨¹ ì–´ of”. the other issue is that it didn't teach the alphabet or pronunciation rules."
"the speaking part is sometimes a little buggy, but overall i'm happy with this pp!"
"there is only pictures and japanese words, no english (other then in menu) which i get since some words can't be translated into english but i wasn't used to this learning style so it took a few tries to get used to it, now i'm learning at a steady pace"
"however, i would suggest a basic background in german if you have never studied before."
"unfortunately the pp doesn't allow you to complete milestones like you can on the desktop version, and some of the pictures are difficult to see on my phone screen."
maybe if the borders between the pictures were smaller it would help
the only issue i have had is background noise affects how well it years and rates your pronunciation.
"i'm learning japanese and it helps me with grammar, letters, and pronunciation."
i wish you guns will add some tips about oral practice especially for a exam.
"love it so far, although the prices in my opinion could be lowered"
"it does require a good internet connection, but being able to steadily keep learning while anywhere in the house with the babies has helped a lot!"
and i was wondering if the games you have on the webster will be added to the apes at any point?
"you are good at what you are doing, but if you added a option to type down the definition of that word in english or what ever language you speak (in general) and in that language you are ( also generally said) trying to learn and type down for noble, but other wise great job."
the only thing that would be better is if they added explanations along with the images in case you do not understand what you are saying based on the picture.
"the requirements for the pronunciation feel like i'm speaking quite mechanically, but you have to start somewhere."
so i am writing to let you know what language i want..the language i want to learn is bulgaria because my step dad is bulgaria and i want to learn his language so please put it on there so i can learn it of˜.
"i hate that i have to pay to be more advanced in it, i wish it were free"
"learned quite a bit on the first lesson, i just wish i could get a translation so i know exactly what i'm saying."
i like it so far no issues but it would be great that show what are u saying instead of just images
would love for daily reminders built in.
great pp on every bit but can you please add more languages
just having a hard trying to add on a second language.. i have my first one and went and purchased a second language for when i am done with the first.. please help anyone!
"it sometimes crash, and difficult to login."
you have to pay a lot of money to get all lessons.
really good program the i wish they would break down some word and their meaning
this pp is really perfect unfortunately i cannot afford the subscription but i recommend this pp fully wen i can afford it i will subscribe you
i love this pp just can afford the price to keep learning
shame it is not free.
stop telling me to rate your apes while i'm using them
