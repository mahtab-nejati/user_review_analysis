"﻿""the pp itself is a convenient learning tool and i enjoy having a cup of coffee while learning a new language every day!""",0
"â­of¦‰domingo, in my opinion and experience, ist the number one pp for learning for example german.",0
"eventough, that's something we can fix with premium!",0
and i'm considering it.,0
this pp is total worth it!,0
4'5/5!!,0
!â­ love of’–,0
i got this pp to learn japanese so i could eventually play japanese games without goose translate.,0
"the first couple lessons were focused mainly on a small set of characters and the sounds they made, with one or two simple words tossed in.",0
"the next two lessons also have new characters in it, however are mostly focused on words, and not the new characters.",0
i can't learn with those.,0
it is very easy and fun at first.,0
i have been stuck for days on a level because of this.,0
it can be frustration and rewarding at the same time.,0
wonderful to be able to access language learning at home and at a time to suit your own convenience.,0
"but still, a great pp.",0
heather,0
i download to learn makarin.,0
it's good.,0
i've learnt numbers and greetings.,0
"for example i could recognise the numbers and match them to the characters and which were what numbers, but found it hard to just count to 10 on my own.",0
however a lot of practicing helps,0
"this is really fun to use, while it is useful as well.",0
overall pretty good,0
as a virtual beginner it has given me a good start.,0
i find i can now read french somewhat but have some difficulty with understanding speech at normal pace.,0
slow speech i can deal with.,0
but that's fine.,0
domingo is an amazing pp for learning a new language!,0
there is nothing i dislike about the pp.,0
it may be a server thing.,0
"but besides that, this pp is definitely worth your time!",0
i highly recommend it.,0
a pleasure to use and fun at the same time.,0
quite adjective once you move up the leagues.,0
4 stars :),0
domingo is a great pp for casual and on the go people who want to learn a new language.,0
the pp is better with uncommon languages.,0
"it's a fun pp, and adjective.",0
worth checking out at any rate.,0
this pp is really great for beginners to learn new languages but that is also its limit.,0
"you have a 5 heart system that if you lose all your hearts, then you either buy domingo plus or you can take more practice, to earn 1 heart back.",0
the practice tests are unlimited giving you a truly free experience while also encouraging you to practice your language more.,0
"domingo is a great language learning pp, but it's not perfect.",0
"any assistance to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated, dance schon!",0
"domingo is a very nice, efficient pp for learning languages, which has become a hobby for me now.",0
"something happened, though, and unfortunately i can't give my full 5 stars.",0
"i took a test to advance through a lesson which i already know enough about, which i had to use 5 lights for.",0
can something be done about this?,0
i love this pp!,0
"i'm learning latin, because as a writer, it's something that i've always wanted to do.",0
"domingo is terrific for folks like me, who instinctively ""get"" language and how it's structures.",0
that's it.,0
the hardest thing about domingo for me is slowing down so i don't get too frustrated - but that's completely on me.,0
makes it fun to learn another language i did not give 5 stars as i feel that there still room for improvement.,0
this is really a handy little pp to help teach you language basis.,0
easy to get the hang of.,0
quick to introduce higher level content.,0
paid pp there isn't a counter.,0
"paid pp offers office content, free pp doesn't.",0
this is a solid pp for getting an introduction to just about any language.,0
i like to practice with this pp for a couple of months before i go an international trip so that i'm not completely lost when i arrive.,0
i gave it 4 stars because there are bags from time to time.,0
"otherwise, i think this is a great and useful pp",0
this pp has been really good at giving some basic lessons.,0
other than that i've found this pp really useful at learning some key vocal and sentences.,0
it's a great way to keep your mind active and learn another language.,0
there is room for improvement though.,0
"but i do love the format, ease of use, cracking of progress and my vocabulary is growing.",0
thank you!,0
"really helpful overall, with a few issues.",0
"i'm doing the japanese lessons, and there a couple of things other users have mentioned as not quite correct.",0
"as long as you do the research on your own, you can figure these issues out.",0
"overall, fun and useful!",0
this pp is a great way to learn how the speak in a different language.,0
my only problem is that if you take a break off the pp then when you come back you might not remember clot of the translations.,0
i tell you it is worth the paid version i was frustrated with the free version i love this pp it has really helped me expand my vocabulary and understand verbs the only reason why it's not five stars is because i'm not that great at spanish yet ll and i think it would be nice to have practice conversations somehow in the pp not just random things like your cat is pretty.,0
this is a good pp .,0
for example a certificate which you could print off to remind yourself of how far you have progressed in your study.,0
i really like this pp!,0
a great pp overall!,0
"it's good, but lacks some needed features.",0
fun intuition learning experience.,0
therefore i personally almost always get the first try of those wrong.,0
how can i solve it?,0
a great way to learn a language!,0
easy to use and fun too.,0
it isn't fun having to put up with that nonsense.,0
i've been using this application and all was great since last week.,0
"encouraging to succeed, that is built into the pp, so helps you continue trying language.. but quite clung program.",0
but grateful for access.,0
great tool for language practice on the go.,0
it's perfect for learning languages.,0
although that would probably be more difficult to teach with how this pp is set up.,0
i love this pp.,0
it allows me to continue to practice and use the language that i learned without having a native speaker to speak with.,0
excellent pp to enhance learning.,0
and what they mean.,0
i mix them up to much.,0
i've to close the pp and open it again to fix it and sometimes it still doesn't work.,0
i hope you will fix this soon,0
stay focused and keep with it.,0
then i can not complete the course˜,0
that's actually a good solution.,0
domingo is fun again!,0
ultimately i don't think i make a lot of progress.,0
i'm trying to expand my limited french vocabulary and domingo is definitely refreshing my knowledge and improving my speech.,0
this pp seems pretty solid!,0
great pp.,0
"wife already learned german, had many conversations in german with local speakers.",0
i'm learning spanish now that we are stateside.,0
thought it would be more useful.,0
can't wait to be able to communicate better with my soldiers.,0
it discourages me from using the pp.,0
"before, we could even congratulate the weekly dinners.",0
i hope the domingo team take all these into consideration and effect.,0
this pp is so amazing!,0
"it helps me a lot in learning french, english, and organ.",0
can you tell me what should i do or please fix this?,0
thank you.,0
nice program.,0
learning japanese.,0
training based on three weeks of use.,0
pretty good pp.,0
i just download it and have all ready learned a lot.,0
great selection of languages.,0
very easy to learn and the pp slowly increases difficulty.,0
please improve this function.,0
thanks of˜Š,0
very useful for learning french.,0
i have to say that i had passed the beginning levels in a class and that is why it was easy for me.,0
i don't know how to report the problem!,0
thanks for the good days,0
a bit too much forceful and overlay motivation.,0
but it might be only because i am older and know what i want.,0
i do appreciate the work and time that went into producing the rumania course.,0
i t is imperative that these at least be reviewed by a native english speaker!,0
"so far, so good.",0
"i have no idea if it's teaching me latin american spanish or european spanish, but being a beginner, it might not matter right now.",0
"(are you listening, pp developer?)",0
that needs to be fixed.,0
great pp i feel like i'm learning more here than in spanish class.,0
"i like the pp, i like the languages it promotes and the learning program and everything.",0
"so, that's the only part i don't like.",0
great pp and fun to use.,0
"all the lessons are beneficial though, especially for a free pp & i can certainly recommend it.",0
i like it clot but if i had not previously doubled in the language i would be totally lost.,0
like i said if i had not doubled in the language in my younger years i would have thrown my phone across the room and quit.,0
it should be available to all.,0
hopefully domingo will change this.,0
excellent and getting better.,0
a bit harder for beginners with no knowledge.,0
"would like to see more done, such a new fun and situation activities.",0
the new reading one is excellent!,0
"idioms, flirting phrases and 3 outfits is it so far.",0
great for not letting my a level knowledge get rusty after years :).,0
great and free.,0
it's a lot of fun and i would recommend it to anyone who is totally new to a language.,0
i download domingo to learn arabic.,0
"because of this, i've stopped using the pp and moved on to a study guaranteed to reach only ma.",0
"for other languages, this pp is a no brazier.",0
i find that too be very strange when there are so many lesser spoken languages,0
"if i was rating only the learning experience, 5 stars.",0
the lessons are fun and effective.,0
"i'm learning so much, and enjoying the process.",0
the pp itself is 4 stars.,0
"the approach to learning is fun and easy, though.",0
"very, very quick work to get it online.",0
congratulations to the epic volunteers of™‚,0
"suggestions from users are, however, mostly accepted.",0
really great for free version!,0
i have had a great experience using this for the last week.,0
refreshing my spanish because i've lost connection to my mother tongue.,0
wondering if it'sin the works as i'ma hands on learner.,0
i also have the keyboard download on my phone to use as an option.,0
hope to see this included if it's not.,0
:),0
a very good way to learn the basis of a language.,0
the pp is great!....,0
of˜Š,0
great pp for learning a new language.,0
i can only compare to the roseola stone pp which is obviously a lot more expensive in comparison.,0
if this was included i would definitely buy the premium.,0
a great pp to get your feet wet in learning a new language.,0
"sometimes, however, it is not always accurate.",0
"well the final two remaining were ""press"" which means ""you're welcome "" in english, but the only remaining option to select was ""thank you"".",0
this could be very confusing to many people!,0
that would help.,0
"great pp, very helpful.",0
"my wife and i are learning french together, and we are having so much fun!",0
there is one issue i can think of.,0
"i am currently in the ruby league, and for the achievement i need to be in the gold league.",0
"sure, you can take the long way through the language, but it's time consuming and annoying.",0
doesn't completely replace traditional instruction but does a good job.,0
this pp was great.,0
"so, would domingo solve this problem?",0
it's a wonderful application.,0
i am an english speaker who had been studying japanese for 2 years prior to using this pp.,0
"the pp is very easy to use, but i have encountered some problems.",0
i also speak german so i practice on this pp.,0
hopefully this will become better in the future.,0
"so far, very easy to use and in learning quickly.",0
"but i am learning, so there's that.",0
it has many different languages to choose from.,0
this pp is amazing!,0
i love everything about!,0
"i'm currently trying to speak french and organ, and so far i'm doing good in french!",0
i'd like to study any time without having to wait.,0
"so far, good job!",0
it requires your effort to learn properly.,0
"but it's a good pp, functional, and with more effort i feel i could learn well !",0
great pp.,0
"because some people don't want to write to someone, or something like that.",0
"but, domingo is great in all other ways.",0
"however, it is staying 4 of´ until it is added.",0
and i really wanted to give this pp 5 of´.,0
pretty good pp.,0
very useful.,0
four stars but overall the pp is great.,0
so far i've really enjoyed learning with domingo.,0
however i am learning the fundamentals of sentence and word construction.,0
i don't recommend only using domingo though.,0
"overall a good pp, it's just a bit hard to get used to.",0
hopefully i can learn better the more i use it though.,0
this is a really helpful pp.,0
i've learned so much already since i started using it.,0
but it can be very frustration in the way that some of the features work.,0
i love it.,0
i can't believe how much i am learning.,0
plus it is free.,0
i'm i upgrade that one day.,0
"so new earners with scratch their heads in confusion as to why ""boy"" is spelled as ""black"" but in other phrases and exercises as ""bhallaic"".",0
this may also apply to languages with declensions.,0
"for context, i was learning german through english.",0
really easy to use.,0
"i really love it, and it's easy to control yourself go keep doing it and it won't takes long everyday.",0
"oh whatever, it's really a good pp.",0
download it!!!,0
),0
"learning arabic, german and french on do is fun.",0
"there may be a few little flakes, but these can be discussed in the forum.",0
"for becoming a client speaker, you should immense yourself in a language in different ways though.",0
this is a great pp for languages.,0
"i'm in th grade, and i'm trying to learn organ.",0
"other than that, i love this pp and i really recommend it.",0
this is an awesome application.,0
try for reading this comment and for making this pp and dating it â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,0
i appreciate having an pp that actually helps me learn spanish.,0
"if so, then the slow pace is on me.",0
domingo enables me to extensively practise polish.,0
both in reading and in writing.,0
"it is a good tool to practise speaking as well, however that is completely up to you, not required by the pp nor checked by the pp.",0
for that purpose i bought a book.,0
this is pp is unique.,0
"there is one problem, though.",0
i lately have gotten too much homework to complete in one night.,0
so i set domingo aside... and didn't have enough gems to buy streak freeze for 4 days.,0
"not only the moscow that didn't deserve this, but my streak, gone.",0
however i have loved every moment of using this pp,0
love this!,0
so convenient to use!,0
instead of spending mindedness hours on social media doing nothing you can learn something!,0
easy to follow and learn from...i didn't give it 5 stars only as it isn't perfect but it does appear as if they welcome the feedback to improve the software.,0
i enjoy learning the languages on do lingo.,0
good and simple.,0
this pp offers a way to learn english every day.,0
"its good actually, i'm learning a lot.",0
"but still a good pp, probably just me, but please do some minor improvement for people like me that can easily get bored.",0
hoping for a fun learning experienceeee,0
"so far, very interesting and fun way to refresh my basic level of spanish.",0
already recommended to some friends.,0
"after 3 years of studying japanese in school, i couldn't tell you any anti.",0
"now with domingo, i feel like a pro!",0
much more confident speaking to my family in japan.,0
this is a decent pp for beginning to learn spanish.,0
"really educational, fun and easy to use.",0
it has been very helpful in getting basic phrases down.,0
i like using it when i want to relax and to my surprise i have managed to memories some expressions and words although my sporadic use of it.,0
"i think is a nice pp to use in one's free time to learn without stress and effort, but ease and comfort.",0
very good.,0
fun.,0
otherwise everything is good.,0
might just be my phone?,0
but it only happens with domingo.,0
i find it easy to use.,0
it has built my confidence and desire to stick with the effort to learn spanish.,0
love the pp.,0
this prevents me from moving on to the next question..please fix.,0
i'm using motor go-plus,0
good language learning pp that can be used for free without too many inconvenience.,0
it is a good pp for learning new ranges.,0
"domingo straits you off with basic levels, there is different subjects.",0
pretty good overall but has a few issues.,0
it's nice to use but i don't really like to type a lot.,0
it's finicky.,0
but overall i like the pp.,0
most of the times it's easy to use.,0
"been great learning it so far, easy to use while traveling or just have an extra moment.",0
it might later as i'm still new to this.,0
"great overall, glad to be learning!",0
!,0
"other than that, it's great!",0
i don't know how to explain it but i did learn quite a bit but for some reason i can't quite comprehend i could say or get the whole lesson class and leveling doesn't quite seem right or feel right if that makes any sense at all?,0
this is a great way to develop language skill.,0
sometimes i confused in many words so i can't share my problem with them .,0
"i love this pp, so far give learnt clot.",0
i think it would help in the learning process.,0
"it is a great pp, i'm learning spanish and i think it is very effective.",0
i really love this pp.,0
they are not as clear as i would like them.,0
i have learned though how to see the characters in hind.,0
really learning clot.,0
thanks!,0
it is a very helpful pp.,0
i am learning french and it is so much easier and fun to learn.,0
i recommend it.,0
misleading it says learn english.,0
fun and easy to use for now.,0
sure it will be getting harder.,0
i work on five sessions a day and am progressing well in french.,0
i hope duoliongo can solve this problem sooner.,0
this pp is perfect to learn languages.,0
if there is martha included then i am sorry for the comment.,0
of˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜„of˜„,0

domingo so far has been very helpful in my learning experience.,0
"i personally need a lot more practice with learning new things, and thanks to this pp, i can do that without burdening anyone else.",0
purely amazing!,0
it is very helpful and even refreshed your newly acquired knowledge of the language.,0
this is the perfect pp for learning a language.,0
"very nice pp, with nice exercises.",0
haven't spent to much time on it but so far it seems that it can provide a nice introduction to languages.,0
i've tried their names and email yet it keeps saying no results found.,0
still this is a great way to learn a language that you like.,0
i'm having a great time learning a new language.,0
i really enjoy using this pp and the challenges it presents when learning a language.,0
my boyfriend who is german was caught off guard when i told him good morning in german.,0
keep plugging along and hope to improve.,0
i think this pp is helping me to wrap my brain around spanish.,0
i find it fun and just enough challenge to want to come back.,0
i am enjoying the learning experience,0
"i'm really liking the way it allows me to check that, i'm getting the understanding of what i'm saying and, the pronunciation of each word so that i am not sounding like a nut âœŒ",0
great pp.,0
"a good, free option to practice another language.",0

bow it's pretty helpful.,0
very easy to learn if you have the time and eagerness.,0
above average to excellent.,0
to have a free pp that drills one in a language is quite excellent.,0
"there are a few bags (greek), but overall an pp i heartily recommend.",0
"if you are trying to learn a language, domingo is free, try it.",0
i have taken spanish for at least 4 or more years in my life but haven't been consistent.,0
i love the culture and language.,0
plus its free!,0
great and easy way to pick up a new language.,0
the lessons are progressive and fun.,0
you can also check on translations by clinking on the words to check.,0
enjoyable and educational.,0
has some faults but only slight and altogether a brilliant pp,0
good pp.,0
assisting me in learning a tough language in a very easy and playful way.,0
just love it.,0
really helpful and pleasant to use.,0
it is wonderful!,0
i recommend this pp.,0
so far good.,0
simple to use.,0
user friendly.,0
all positive.,0
i don't need them to ensure engagement,0
"a good teaching pp for sure, and it is not a play to learn scar...i am excited and really do believe that if i apply myself daily with this tool, i can actually become client!",0
i like the style of learning.,0
my reading is still better than my speaking.,0
my hearing and understanding is improving.,0
"i've been instructed to ""use an apple product"" which i dont like or use.",0
"i'm feeling a little s** on, here... i'll request a refund before spending $800 on a new phone, just so i can use their product!",0
will update if they ever correct this...,0
"it's fixed, but that was weird.",0
are.,0
for a 12 year old this is pretty fun it gives you many ways to learn and it pretty easy to i am trying to learn japanese,0
"there is a free version with limited use and adds, it will bug you to buy the premium thing but you dont have to.",0
"it will give you new words without a definition, but your allowed to look at the translation.",0

so far so good.,0
the pp is also easy to use.,0
i love this program.,0
the exercises are interesting and helpful.,0
it's like i am playing a game but learning a language!,0
if this is enabled i rate all stars.,0
this is a really good pp!,0
i haunt memories clot yet but it is probably because it is my first day.,0
its great and the apes seems to be working well.,0
i am trying the trial and i have decided that i want to get it for my family and myself.,0
very nice pattern to learn any new language.,0
i can say it's best.,0
free lesson is great but u have to pay for other lessons.,0
but its good though.,0
genius!,0
i can feel my brain making associations.,0
strangest thing but beautiful to recognise.,0
no english even needed!,0
"so far, so good.",0
"just started, but this seems the best pp i have found so far to learn italian.",0
it seems like a good pp so far.,0
i just wish learning these different languages didn have to cost anything...i mean that's what everyone lacks is communication skill regardless of region.,0
but it's not my call ll,0
learning has never been easier.,0
so far this pp is very helpful with learning a new language.,0
it's not easy learning japanese but so far i'm having fun doing it.,0
not a really great experience if you don't pay .,0
my knowledge of hebrew vocabulary is the only reason i have any idea what i'm saying or hearing.,0
nice pp and very user friendly.,0
i would say this language software is a great supplement to learning a new language.,0
easy patterns and simple instructions.,0
all you need is persistence and the willing to learn.,0
i like the pp.,0
it helps me with my homework and other languages i always wanted to dear,0
it's really good (^^)!,0
good pp and walks you through easily and logical,0
interactive and information .,0
very straightforward and practical,0
pretty good.,0
the 30 min lesson took less than 30 minutes.,0
please help,0
good job with having you repeat words so you retain it with images.,0
it could be fun if only i had the attention span to keep up with it,0
a great pp for learning a new language intuitively.,0
simply asking you to try again.,0
that said it is a brilliant pp and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn a new language.,0
i used it and went to a french conversational class.,0
"early days so no conversational stuff yet, but a really good foundation.",0
"so far, so good.",0
"even with those issues, roseola stone works well for me, even with its 'throw em in the water and hope they swim' strategy.",0
it actually works and helps me learn the verbs and grammar of the target language without explanation.,0
"i must say, thanks, roseola stone!",0
it's pretty good!!,0
"the mobile version of roseola stone is great, but has some flaws.",0
"mild annoyance, but overall worth your time and money.",0
user friendly and i am learning.,0
"especially in the beginning, you don't want to mess up the basis.",0
"even though it wouldn't be the first pp i would use, it is still really great practice!",0
i like roseola stone's approach.,0
"the zero translation and repetition until it sticks seems to work best for me even if it can feel a little tedious at the time, it's still fun to use.",0
good way to learn on the go.,0
i'd like to know exactly what i'm saying you know ?,0
other than that i really like it.,0
it's a very useful and well put together pp and program.,0
in only on lesson 2. i am familiar with japanese.,0

i enjoy spending time on it.,0
great pp.,0
pretty good so far.,0
great pp to learn from,0
find spend more time with this language pp than others.,0
pat,0
that is aggravating.,0
otherwise the program seems to function well for other lesson types.,0
great!,0
there are exercises focused on this to which are very useful.,0
i love how easy it is to use,0
this could have been bad.,0
it's still an easy awesome way to learn.,0
"i like it, i'm learning- slowly.",0
so far so good.,0
even without doing the initial into to explain it were able to figure what they were doing in the pictures.,0
so far so good.,0
good pp for simple learning french quickly.,0
immersion works better than vocabulary for me personally,0
i'm trying to learn a language for a trip coming up.,0
yes it really is good.,0
but thought it was free.,0
just unit 1 is available.,0
but that's fine.,0
thanks,0
easy to use.,0
easy memorization.,0
"after having my eyes set on roseola stone for several years i've come to discover that there are better products for less, such as domingo or memories.",0
good and clear pronunciation.,0
i like it.,0
am sure my pronunciation is improving as i move ahead learning,0
but i'm learning and that's a big plus thanks,0
quite enjoyable tool indeed.,0
it is a fun learning experience.,0
thank you roseola stone.,0
"so far, so good.",0

i think it's very good.,0
this pp make you learn the language.,0
"great so far, but really a refreshed.",0
interested in how it will progress.,0
"it's great for the deal they are offering, brings them at or below the cost of the other paying services",0
what am i saying?,0
it tells me with pictures and act- but what am i saying exactly?,0
very helpful in grasping a foreign language,0
easiest way to learn s new language should use this in schools rather then a teacher,0
simple to use and convenient,0
it's easy to use and a fun way to learn,0
a great addition to other programs,0
easy to learn and use,0
they give you the perfect platform to start to learn is up to you to be consist that so don't blame the program blame yourself for not being consistent on doing the work,0
so far easy to start and learn st lesson!,0
"learn, fun & easy tool(:",0
good pp to refresh with as well as learn,0
otherwise i feel i am learning,0
this is my first time learning another language on an pp and i am very thankful for your pp you very much for helping me trying to learn new english new languages to learn and talk any languages with my friends,0
working on spanish using both roseola and domingo.,0
"so far i feel they work similarly, but i personally enjoy roseola more",0
educational and engaging.,0
great and fun,0
it's good for your fleecy and help you spell and be a good reader.,0
i to like this pp can help a lot of people in the world ask me my parents my family everybody in the world can you this pp.,0
i find it very useful and convenient,0
just starting week 2 (day 9).,0
fun is not the right word.,0
but effective might be.,0
we'll see.,0
fun and easy!,0
i tried learning portuguese as kid by using roseola stone.,0
i was easily distracted and i didn't learn the language.,0
now that i am older i am able to appreciate the pp by how it reaches someone how to learn a language.,0
truth be told.,0
"trust me, i am already seeing great results with my makarin class.",0
learning to speak spanish by thinking in spanish.. now.. the pp.is really good..,0
and the monkey lips the switch.,0
its great to learn a new language,0
this program is the best at learning a new language,0
very nice and well done!,0
i think i am catching on.,0
will see how it goes.,0
very satisfied so far with unit 1 completion,0
fun learning and needs working here and there but great,0
as a bit i have had to also learn american english.,1
the only problem i've come across is this weird pitch.,1
in the free pp you have 5 mistakes before you have to wait 4 hours to move on.,1
"some errors in the french learning module, however, that (according to question-specific message boards) have been outstanding for years, i.e.",1
i had no problem with this pp until i upgrade it to the latest version.,1
"while the introduction of the health system first ruined this pp, its worst consequences were now fixed and you can regain hearts by solving more difficult lessons.",1
it's a learning process and there has to be a little room for error.,1
they are only features on the computer version.,1
"that's a pity, because many times the first word is an article and identifying the gender is a challenging part in some languages.",1
with japanese i went to another pp that moves through the lessons more slowly but gives me a more solid rounding in things i really need to know better.,1
"my 25 day streak disappeared, and the cut moscow was left crying in my into.",1
"i am almost done with most of the levels available, not sure what happens next and if you need to pay to get to further levels.",1
i prefer to press on the words because it's quicker and my keyboard on my phone is not the best.,1
team domingo please give an update with essaying feature as soon as possible,1
"good free pp, as are a pain but can get rid of if you pay plus you can also get unlimited hearts, but if your like me and don't like paying for extra you can still learn extensively without a problem using the pp",1
"awesome way to refresh a language, but i find that if you want to learn from scratch, you should supplement domingo with some other textbook or learning software.",1
it seems that the recent few updated made it work worst.,1
it very good learning apes but the in pp price is high pus make it 10$ for a month otherwise it's a good pp,1
"if i had no previous hebrew studies, this pp would not be very helpful.",1
"pretty good, wish i could get to the level in already at and go from there but the beginning stages are a good refreshed",1
"i recommend learning in conjunction with an audit program to get additional speaking practise in (with makarin, it's all about the intonation).",1
you never know if you are perceiving it wrong and therefore learning the language wrong.,1
"if using this pp, learn the words first on another pp but then use this one to practice those basis.",1
pretty good but i think it starts at a weird place ??,1
maybe it's made for people who already have some knowledge on the language.,1
i really like roseola stone because they teach you how you pronounce the words but i just wish that they gave you an actual schedule to follow that shows what you should do everyday because i have found some other things on the pp that i didn't even know were there or when to use them.,1
"my reason for not leaving 5 stars is because the pp and webster are so different, and i use both!",1
"in high valyrian, the grammar explanations dont exist in pp, but do in the webster.",1
"in the pp you can ""break"" your completed lessons and restore them, but not in the webster.",1
"also in the pp, some lessons are longer/shorter than on the webster.",1
i'd like to get consistency,1
"organ for example it's more difficult for me, because i don't understand the characters so i make a lot of mistakes trying to guess the meaning and because i'm not premium, i waste hearts.",1
"i know that practicing you earn hearts, but in this way it's difficult to advance.",1
"the only ""practice"" these lessons have for the new characters is a match the character to the sound.",1
except it does not actually teach you what the words mean for a while.,1
"that's somewhat confusing, especially when it adds unknown words.",1
you have to guess what the phrases say to translate.,1
please work on translating english to arabic words a little more.,1
"sad to see the heart system in place, pushing people to opt for the plus option.",1
"perhaps if this option was cheaper, more would access the service.",1
"also, more explanation of why something is wrong would be very helpful.",1
it random throws in things like characters and sounds and words.,1
sometimes i'd forget what something means and have to wait for it to come back up when practicing rather than just looking at what it means.,1
"i am trying to learn russian and i'm only having issues with using the microphone to speak the words, i feels like i'm saying it properly but it says incorrect i just brush it off.",1
i would like to see if it could teach sign language or even bridle.,1
sometimes the voice audit is not brilliant.,1
"when i open the pp, it often says ""there was a problem with the connection"" even though my wife is fine and i can access other wife required applications just fine.",1
personally i would prefer more spoken challenges but otherwise a great pp!,1
"very good pp, good lessons design, balanced and very adjective, unfortunately like for other apes you need to pay to get unlimited time and avert free, but for beginning is more than you need, before you use all hearts its enough to learn the pp and decide if you want to buy premium, i will definitely, knowledge is priceless!",1
i do think that do would benefit from teaching the letters or alphabet in the languages that use an alphabet.,1
"spanish, for example, has a limit on what you can learn per day, which doesn't exist on some other languages.",1
but the drawback of those uncommon languages is inconsistent audit clips.,1
some sound like they're from the inside of a tin can and are really hard to make out.,1
"i am learning chinese and japanese and domingo has taught me how to read, hear, and talk; however it didn't teach me how to write.",1
users are also not able to customize the theme of the pp or change the voices of narrators.,1
"on the bright side, tests are simple and beginner-friendly, but it won't allow you to be very proficient in the language you learn.",1
"it gives tips on each lesson module, but there are no external links embedded.",1
"i actually enjoy this pp quite a bit, the reason why i gave it four stars is because there was a pop-up advertisement that said if you got your friends to join that you would get a week of free unlimited access.",1
i got two of my friends to join which means i should have two weeks of unlimited access yet for whatever reason this does not appear to be the case.,1
pp crashed in the middle of the quit.,1
"once i restarted the pp, i'd lost the lights and need to use 5 more lights again.",1
"the only thing i think that would make the pp better is not only a translation, but a brief explanation of your error when you get something wrong.",1
"one suggestion is to have more tips, guideline especially when it comes to sentence construction.",1
"i am studying japanese now, and i have to regularly goose to understand some concepts (wa, ga, ka, etc).",1
"there is a forum and while the comments are useful, i can't always filter which is exactly an ""opinion"" or an actual correct answer..",1
my only issue is how hard they push the paid program.,1
it feels like the free pp is more of an advertisement/trial for the paid pp.,1
free pp has tons of advertisements.,1
"foi the sound won't play or the images won't show, but it's rare, and not unusual for a free pp.",1
the thing i really don't like is that there is no way to report these bags!,1
"a couple of things that would make it even better though; being able to look over past lessons for reminders if you haven't been on the pp for a while, and have some sort of vocal dictionary of all of the words you've learnt so far.",1
"i think if they made it so you could hear the sound of new words /phrases when they're presented it would help learn faster, in my opinion.",1
"also it would be beneficial if you could chat with others, perhaps someone that speaks the language you're learning to help get used to writing in a conversational manner and someone trying to learn our language could chat with us for practice too.",1
so happy to learn scottish garlic but the american english requires a level of translation for english.,1
"a bit buggy in the andros, how i was taught to pronounce things at garlic classes by native speakers in glasgow can be different as well as different phrases.",1
it might be better if you were put back a level or two once you've had a break.,1
however if there was more little virtual rewards for getting to particular levels i think it would be good.,1
"it can actually teach you a new language and does a great job encouraging you, but something that i want developer to add (please) is dark mode (because it's 2020 and only having light mode is quite outdated).",1
"i'm taking an english-german course, and only half of the lessons have ""hints"" (which is actually required if you want to learn a language).",1
"also, the hints on desktop are much more mature than the mobile ones",1
not accepting one of two correct answers for the write what you hear questions.,1
overall helpful but sometimes new characters you haven't seen before are put in front of you when you have to figure out a complete statement.,1
i don't have the sound so i can't do the listening exercises.,1
"anyway, the microphone works and i have no problem with speaking parts.",1
"i wish there was more explanation about different endings to words, and an option to pay monthly for the service but will definitely keep using it.",1
"it's a very good pp, but i think u should add something has the ability to till us if our pronunciation is right or wrong and that would be perfect,one more thing, please add arabic language of’“",1
fun and adjective but my mixed out learning topics keep breaking even if i got my streak and did lessons i come on later in the day and they all break.,1
voice for some exercises doesn't work and i can't do listening exercises... very bothering,1
"content is high quality, as are quite intrusively annoying but i guess they have to make money somehow, and the ad free option is way too expensive.",1
it would also be amazing if it was able to teach different kinds of sign language too!,1
"it's great, i just wish they would spend more time on verbs.",1
maybe have separate lessons where you learn just the verbs.,1
the mid doesn't work well and stops a lot.,1
small bags that hang up the shone but can easily switch to the computer to pass those (usually happens during a practice),1
"it's an interesting pp to book my dutch,but i don't know why there is no voice in listening exercises!!!",1
the pp' gives lots of revision of words i already know.,1
i don't think i get enough repetition of the things i fail on.,1
it's really good and helps me learn spanish very easy but the hearts are just annoying especially when you only have one left and you get a question wrong you can't save your progress of˜ž,1
"why has ""tips"" suddenly disappeared?",1
each lesson segment used to have a tips section with basic into on that subject and it's just gone...,1
"i really like this pp, only problem is that it doesn't have my language in it sadly.",1
i'm hoping domingo will add some more languages in the future.,1
would be nice if they gave more definitions.,1
"it is great for brushing up in my chinese skill, but it was impossible to learn ukranian since i dont know the alphabet.",1
this new health system should be abolished.,1
"i prefer the former groups before you introduced these leagues, we normally compete in a group and complete challenges, that was more fun than this present league.",1
i really loved the pp but sadly these recent features are not reaching my satisfaction as a consumer.,1
newest update: 12.30.19 i don't know what happened but i can't use the speaking ability test.,1
"each time i tried to speak, the microfon suddenly turned off by itself.",1
"i've waited for an hour until the mid turn on again but the same things kept happened until i install it and re- download it, but nothing happened.",1
"it still the same, the mid won't work.",1
the only problem is that since you are learning something new you are going the make mistakes and the whole heart thing ruins that.,1
otherwise it should provide an opportunity to teach alphabet to earners.,1
"bow, from the second level i couldn't hear the voices.",1
"it was a very good experience for me learning french with domingo, until recently i have found a bothering problem with sounds, i'm reporting the problem of sound missing in every single exercise and it's still there.",1
"now i'm considering leaving domingo, without sounds playing it's more likely waste of time for me.",1
"too many interruption to the lessons, too much focus on bones based on gazing theory.",1
"main issue is the interaction of the pp with the phone keyboard and dictionary, an improvement would really help.",1
"it's utility is greatly lessened, however, by the frequently incompetent or confusing translations, which make it impossible to know what the rumania actually means.",1
"one annoying detail, is that the lessons accept the ""down arrow / new line"" button on the andros keypad as an alternate enter button, in addition to their ""check results"" button.",1
"since the ""new line"" button is right below the backspace button, i often submit an incorrect answer when i'm only trying to correct a type.",1
"i like the pp, it's just why do you only get a certain amount of hearts.",1
if you lose< how come you have to quit and lose all your progress.,1
my only complaints are i think the hearts should be unlimited.,1
i like learning spanish and i can't do that if it's limiting me on how many mistakes i'm allowed to make.,1
and when i do the speaking test i'm positive i'm saying it right and it doesn't process right sometimes and i loose a heart.,1
"but what i don't like is that i have to wait like 5 hours for 1 heart, so you can't really make mistakes when that's part of learning a new language.",1
i think we should get more hearts like 5 hearts in an hour.,1
only lost a star as i think it would be helpful to have a section on phrases you will need on travelling to italy earlier on which i personally would have found reassuring.,1
"good with basis, but you would have thought the as pay for the lessons, bit you have to get these heart things which discourages you from learning.",1
i wish they had something that explains the tense of words it really would be helpful.,1
"i also hate that when your out of hearts you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can play again, unless you accumulate them through practice runs.",1
it's a great pp but sometimes the hints don't exactly help you with questions.,1
plus some languages don't have the tips section.,1
i'm learning russian and there is no tips page so i have to assume what the ending of the noun is.,1
there's also not much content regarding what you can spend your lights on.,1
"would love a range of outfits to motivate me to earn more lights, or a house!",1
would also love that to be available.,1
unfortunately doesn work well put of good wife bones - clashes and fails to work on g,1
sadly enough you can't start at a higher level,1
"however, for learning arabic, i would tread with caution, as the lessons have a bad habit of mixing modern standard arabic with dialect arabic, which should never be done.",1
looks great but it didn't have that.,1
"it frequently freeze, and random doesn't record my progress.",1
there also seems to be issues singing between the webster and the pp.,1
"i would like to see the stories on the pp, not just the site.",1
and it would be nice to be able to collapse the lessons once you pass a checkpoint.,1
all that strolling is tedious.,1
:) and a vocal review.,1
"the only downside is that it does not explain rules or basis, so the approach is really intuition (a guessing game sometimes, and left to your interpretation of the rules as you go along in learning translations).",1
would be good if they had a reference portion if you want to understand grammar rules.,1
"the only reason it is not 5 stars is one of the voices has too thick an accent to hear properly, and it is only on guess work that i get the words and phrases correct when her voice is used.",1
"being dutch, it is interesting to use this pp but often very frustration, particularly with computer voices that race through a sentence with the consequence of misunderstanding the words.",1
"the translations into english are often strange to my ears, obviously 'dictionary translations' and not in english vernacular, having unusual placement of nous and verbs.",1
"the dutch is often extra long minded, not simple to translate, even for me.",1
"i have a couple of suggestions: 1) the sentences are never too complicated and they rarely used vocabulary from previously completed lessons; 2) in the word selection pool most of the time the first word has a capital letter, which makes it too easy to identify.",1
"for new languages however, i'd like for there to be writing included.",1
"i can type in the spanish, but for the organ and japanese there isn't even tracing.",1
"when it works.of¤¦â€â™€ï¸ for those having office courses not downloading, i just cleared my data under the domingo pp in settings and it fixed my issue.",1
"i had to log back in, but at least it was better than waiting a week for a response from their team (that never happened).",1
"besides this one bug and no email response of¤·â€â™€ï¸, the pp is great.",1
"the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the speaking portions; i'm taking organ, so i don't know if the other languages are like this, but the lady talks way too fast.",1
"there's no option for her to speak more slowly, or to say the sentence in parts.",1
it'd be helpful if you could practice the sentence in parts more slowly before trying to repeat the whole thing.,1
will you be adding barque to the list at some time?,1
"4 stars only because i would like to see a feature whereby it listens to my pronunciation, which roseola stone does have.",1
"for example, in a ""match the pairs"" part of the italian portion, it asks to match the english words with their italian translation.",1
"very good, only want to communicate casually, annoying to be punished for minor spelling mistakes but otherwise can't complain at all.",1
"i love this pp, it should start full conversations though.",1
"( completing the circles, etc) but it's too pick about minor spelling errors.",1
you have to keep tying a whole long complicated sentence over and over because of one or two small errors.,1
the more complicated grammar is equally frustration.,1
the more different grammar needs to start with simple tasks rather than whole sentence translations.,1
some of the achievements are begged.,1
"however i've already completed the league, and did not get the achievement.",1
"great pp, but please fix your achievements.",1
"the way domingo reaches is great; however, the pp is increasingly adding paywalls and is taking most user interactivity away.",1
"clubs, which were a good way for users to learn from each other if kept active, were discontinued, and leaderboards replaced them.",1
"leaderboards make people more competitive, but there's no way to root for each other or learn about others so that they are more than just numbers...",1
"root voices for spoken french, japanese, and german makes it difficult to know if pronunciation accurate but is a relatively ok stand-in for humans speaking.",1
grammar lessons would be a very welcome addition.,1
actually it would be great if it didn't have the problems that it has now  for example the women don't talk anymore or the listening won't be listened or error to load a lesson and so on.,1
"however, there are some minor changes i would like to see: 1. please make it harder to pass the test (i have never failed once) 2. please add drawing characters in different languages (not just choosing) otherwise, it's a wonderful free application with only a 2-second ad at the end of each lesson.",1
sometimes the sound files are broken and also if the english translation isn't exactly as the have it the answer will be marked wrong.,1
the german language pp is more complete than the japanese pp.,1
"however, the as are very annoying and you only get so many chances to get the answers right or you have to wait until the next day.",1
"i find that there is no explanation of words before hand, you're left to figure it out on your own.",1
you also have to spell correctly to complete challenges.,1
its more of a bunch of quires than a relaxed learning experience.,1
"i rate this four stars instead of five because although it's very helpful, most of the sentences they teach you, you wouldn't need to know or they are things that you wouldn't normally say.",1
"i think they should teach you basic sentences that you would use everyday rather than something like ""lots of young men live in america"" or something similar to that.",1
"besides my journey, there is one thing bother me and it is the hearts.",1
it would be a lot more fun if i didn't have to wait four hours for at least one heart.,1
"you need to do lots of practices, and spend more than 5-10 minutes a day or you won't learn much !",1
would be great if it had a speaking only option and a written option as i feel speaking it is more important than reading mostly.,1
"one drawback for me is, (in italian) the lessons aren't comprehensive.",1
"three or four verbs are introduced (sometimes without all the conjugates, which makes irregular verbs difficult), but the exercises will ask for dozens of verbs that weren't introduced.",1
"while it's a great pp (and i use it enough to use the paid version), i still need a notebook to write down and learn verbs with all their conjugates, along with all the glances of the language.",1
the lessons could stand to explain certain things a little better though.,1
like each lesson should have a little into that lays out what will be covered.,1
i would like it much better if there is an option to turn the writing portion of the language you are trying to learn off.,1
just needs more words in every category possible :) thanks,1
i noticed that you don't learn the alphabet yet.,1
it feels slow paced as i expand my french vocabulary.,1
but now i am very disappointed in the lack of lessons.,1
you would get up to 20 lessons at the higher levels which is good for retention as repetition is key but now you only get 4 for each level and that is ridiculous.,1
"ok, this pp is a great free language-learning pp, but i just feel like it doesn teach you correctly sometimes in the exercises, and it doesn't give you too many tips during the lesson either.",1
so if you have the patience and willing to dig for some answers when it marks you wrong (even though 90% of the comments from other users on the pp show that your answer was the same as theirs) you might really enjoy this pp.,1
"i wish the lesson would explain a little more, but the community is so friendly and willing to teach it makes up for the lack of content in the lessons.",1
"i really love the pp except for one piece, the health.",1
"i get they are trying to push the premium service, but the webster doesn't employ this feature and i can learn all day.",1
but if you get into a lesson you struggle with on the pp your health can run out before even completely finishing a single lesson.,1
the reason i don't give it 5 stars is because grammar rules aren't explained you just learn how to say things in other languages.,1
"in the scottish garlic, for example, the mention rules aren't explained properly.",1
"the incentive to practise leagues regularly are mostly positive, except for the 'leagues' feature.",1
can run a bit slowly on my phone.,1
"the occasional bug making lessons impassable, very rare, i've only seen them in practise mode",1
"but the errors, the lack of some vital information while learning and the pure translation-focus of the pp takes away from the learning experience in my opinion.",1
"but, maybe it will be kind lots of as and makes you send some money on the better version.",1
i hope do further develops 'stories' to help with immersion.,1
"the reason i took off one star is because it's a little straight forward, and when you're still learning the alphabet or something, the next thing is something you've never seen before.",1
i also don't like the lives/hearts and how you have to wait to refill them.,1
"please, i can do audit lessons.",1
he cannot start recording somehow.,1
"and please, add a lesson to learn the symbols of the language, letters, anti, etc.",1
"i love it so much and it helped me a lot learning a new language but the"" hearts "" take a very long time to refill that lead me to quit the pp and i wish u would look at this matter and make it better!!",1
"i wish the progress was faster, but the pace seems related to my demonstrated proficient.",1
the only thing missing is some explanation of theory.,1
"love this pp, it's very useful for learning all types of different languages, it's very useful because i am using it for school, i just wish you didn't have to pay to get more unlimited hearts, or just make it so you have more hearts, beside that it's a great pp.",1
"has helped me for sure, but small criticism would be that it is overlay repetition.",1
"repetition bread familiarity, but i feel it can be too repeititve.",1
perhaps an algorithm to measure how many times you got something right or wrong could be used to progress quick earners more quickly?,1
"superb but try to avoid repeating the same sentences in the same lesson several times, it becomes very boring in fact, try to use the words you want me to learn in different sentences to avoid making anyone feel boring, and one more thing, each lesson have many levels, try to make each level is especial and make me feel that i learned new thing even a new sentence",1
i love using dueling but sometimes it takes so much to load the lessons and sometimes it can load them:(,1
problems with timing of the speech function makes me miss words on the pp that i didn mispronounce,1
the latin course forces you to an english sentence structure for translations.,1
"i like the pp, but honestly the passive aggressive modifications get on my nerves.",1
if you skin a day the modifications get sappy.,1
at times want hear any of the audit but it might be the fact that i have a happy phone otherwise great pp.,1
"but i think the process is a bit slow :/ waaaayyy tooooo slooowwwww that instead of pushing myself to learn, i get bored and annoyed.",1
there is a lot of repetition in the lessons which seems to limit the amount of new words that could be introduced under each category.,1
its mainly learning vocabulary and not verb conjunction.,1
occasionally have issues with lessons loading up and there have been a couple of the speaking questions that wouldn't accept your answer unless it was in english but all in all it's a good pp.,1
"it doesn't do much to explain some of the santa and the voice speaks too quickly when you do some of the audit tests but for a free pp this is very, very good.",1
"the pp is enjoyable to use and motivation, but you need to get a book with some grammar in to understand the rules of the language",1
silly types can get annoying but overall awesome product,1
teaching methods are great but please add rude to the languages taught.,1
"also, if the tips contained a list of all the vocabulary taught in lesson for memorizing it would also help (ex: for japanese, all the letters with their pronunciation).",1
"a fun way to learn, however the pp could use a glossy of words you've learned, as well as a proper pronunciation guide.",1
"i can copy the voice perfectly, yet the pp still won't register that i've said it correctly.",1
"it's a good start for a new language, but the audit seems to cut out for no reason periodically.",1
there are times when i must select words and i can't because they don't fully appear on the screen.,1
it lacks a bit of depth to explore the grammar or actual dialogue to listen to and learn from.,1
"if you get like 5 wrong on a lesson and you don't have domingo plus well ,your heart will have no lives and you'll have to wait 4 hours and about 23 minutes.",1
lessons sometimes start without giving you enough information such as using words not previously taught.,1
would be nice to have a vocal library to keep track of words you've learned so far.,1
i wish it let you practice the so each part more.,1
"it's has helped me learn the basis so far, but the only small complaint i have is knowing how to resume where i left off in the lesson.",1
i would say the pp isn't well organized in the home screen.,1
could say don't like the whole set up and everything for leveling and act ..,1
"nice application, very interactive, but i would have loved it more if we could possibly be able to do an online quit competition with our friends, would be nice.",1
however i have encountered stitches and reported it but never received any sort of response.,1
"the pp interface is awesome, but for some languages like makarin, i feel that it is not beginner friendly.",1
it's more of an intermediate practice for people who already know the basis in my opinion,1
i love this pp but i find one fault in it that i couldn't talk to native speaker .,1
my only suggestion is to design better contents for the lesson you work on and some more detailed explanations as to why the answer is right or wrong,1
"i love the pp and it reaches me a lot, but i am still learning a language and whenever i get a word wrong i lose health points and you have to do a lesson and get them all right to earn back health points.",1
i gave it 4 stars because i don't really like the idea of hearts i think you should be able to just keep on learning rather than being forced to pay Â£60 a year for infinite hearts,1
con: would like to see explanations of grammar.,1
"however, because we have to have hearts, it slow down learning progress.",1
"domingo, please can you stop the hearts as they let down your pp.",1
the pp is great but sometimes the voice just stops working,1
i just have a hard time hearing the sounds.,1
"i use a phone and tablet, phone pp has more oral exercises.",1
as an australian some of the american usage is frustration in translation.,1
"it is a good pp to learn languages but lately it has problem doubling the lights, it supposedly to watch the adv for few seas but turns out the screen goes all black and stuck.",1
just that there are some specific languages which could be involved like martha but other than that it is all awesome.,1
what i hate is that you have to complete the day's lesson by midnight in order to maintain your streak.,1
"issue is, i cannot add my friend so that we can track each other's progress.",1
"the hearts are a bit annoying, and i wish the pp wasn't so push for you to get pro, but otherwise it's great.",1
i do wish there was a tax for explanations of things like why the same word can be spelled different ways.,1
"i also appreciate the i, the only thing is i wish the domingo podcasts had a tax in the pp rather than a separate webpage.",1
"really great pp for free use, but they may need to review some of the rumania phrases.",1
would've been great if you add latin.,1
and also add an option wherein you look for someone to chat in order to practice your language.,1
"and yeah, can you add a feature where we can save tips office?",1
it just dont have many explanations for the usage of words.,1
might be useful if they put how a word is used in grammar properly.,1
i think it could and should be one of the apes that you don't need to connect to internet for it will be nice for that otherwise great for kiss and adults.,1
"somewhat repetition, but can move forward easily.",1
should be some explanation of towel usage.,1
"lessons move along a bit quick for me, need more time to learn the symbols(letters) new words are not well expressed before expecting you to know them.",1
however i gave it a four because of way too many adds however i recommend you download of˜‰,1
amazing pp but sometimes the formulation of the sentences seem weird and also in some cases they ask you to translate something and it is just a name that you have to write like : hallo hans > hello ...,1
it is sad that there is no feature to switch the default language.,1
"my first language is russian but my phone is set to english, so the pp is also in english which makes it really inconvenient to learn.",1
"it's so useful but i have a major problem, none of the listening tracks play on my phone so i can't answer them, by the way i gave all the permission, what should i do?",1
this is very nice but my only problem is i can't find friends.,1
i notice that some things aren't explained clearly.,1
"a few things here and there that aren't exactly translated right, but i'd like to think it's more of a difference in dialect.",1
why suddenly the pp became unstable?,1
"it masses up up points, days, the number of lessons done and leagues.",1
i do not have access to listening and speaking tasks...,1
"great pp, but it would be perfect if you'd add the grammar explanations and stories in the other languages besides german, french, english etc.",1
i do wish it would challenge me a little faster though.,1
"but in learning arabic the font of assignment is very small, difficult to read, especially for a beginner.",1
.....except that sometimes has problem with its audit system.,1
"the sound doesn't work properly most of the times unfortunately˜¹, unless the application is awesome",1
would be easier though if there was european portuguese because it's not the same as brazilian.,1
after the last update the pp sometimes doesn' t count your progress.,1
also in somehow losing the gems by no means.,1
good pp.... i would prefer if the pp had an explaining feature towards grammar/vocal so i could better understand why the words are in the order that they are etc.,1
i updated my pp but there is no sound for vocal quires when u tape the sound tape,1
"great pp, really helpful of˜‰ don't think the hearts are necessary though.",1
"it's a good pp for learn basic vocabulary, but it's just work on the beginner level.",1
"for some reason they make a louse japanese course, not even covering all the hiring and giving zero lessons for katakana which is essential to learning japanese... you need to have some kind of rd party study aid for these and other asia courses if you want to learn them in depth and not just play a game (>.>) be it a text book, character chart, etc, which is totally unnecessary.",1
"there are better apes for asia but if you're interested in a european language, this application is a must have!",1
"pretty good, except the first time i download it, i disabled it because it wasn't working very good...",1
domingo is a great pp for learning a new language but you have to pay in order to continue learning without any interruption like hearts or as.,1
"good pp, just takes too long to get to an intermediate/senior level for when you already know basis and want to learn more complex sentences.",1
just wish it had dark mode for those late night sessions before bed.,1
"it didn't didn't hello with grammar, just sentence structure.",1
i love this pp but but there are some things i don't like about this pp.when i get things wrong my heart goes down and later i have none so its hard to play sometimes.,1
"the pp is great and i'm learning 2 languages at one time, but the adds are a little ridiculous at times.",1
"it's a little childish, and i wish i was learning more useful language for traveling, but i bet that'll come.",1
might be better if the developer add some more exercises to practice speaking.,1
good pp but does not explain the grammar rules.,1
requires a little research outside of the pp to progress in some of the lessons.,1
mixed voices.,1
get annoyed with the rewards though.,1
pp wont work with andros device?,1
"- samson galaxy 8 i'd love to provide a 5 star review, but as technical support doesn't seem to be able to get my account to work on andros devices (which is what i have) i can use the product i purchased.",1
same here the program today started to pitch i cannot access my plan.,1
i had to sign in again and looks like all my progress saved is gone.,1
"also the audit was struggling to use either with wired headphones, bluetooth or just my phone microphone.",1
it's stuck in office mode.,1
"excellent, but needs an option to rest all lessons, not just one at a time which is too cumbersome when wanting to start after a period away",1
in the past you could slow the pronunciation.,1
mostly good only issue that i'm having is occasionally the pp/ or phone is not picking up what i say,1
a little prices but helps a lot.,1
i'd say getting a brand new phone or using a good microphone would indefinitely help.,1
"i only wish that it would explain the grammar more, as in why the grammar is different i certain situations.",1
it's a bit frustration when it doesn't recognize the word i'm trying to say though.,1
good pp for learning but it costs a lot .,1
a four only in that it is immersion and having a tough time connecting the dots.,1
some hints on purity and fiction in early stages might help in particular with non-neuro based language.,1
"easy to learn, good for beginners but would be good if you didn't need to repeat activities if you got them all correct in the core activities!",1
i love the experience and the ability to learn from this pp the only thing i wish was different is for there to be a way to earn more lessons or even just the ability to get the lessons cheaper.,1
the voice recognition needs improvement though.,1
it is very good but all of it needs to be free.,1
communication should be free!,1
but i wish you let your users try until they get it correct.,1
wish i could repeat it over and over to ensure retention.,1
very good but its a bit annoying u have to pay,1
i am not able to find the option to change from beginner to intermediate on my pp.,1
the audit analysis is great at telling you when you've not pronounced a word correctly however it's not great at helping you improve.,1
"great pp, bit expensive and it is limited in that once you've done the 20 units that's it, nothing more.",1
i think you need both as grammar isn't really explained.,1
tried to sign up on their webster but due to some pitch could subscribe.,1
contracted customer service but what seemed to me an automatic reply.,1
overall pp is good but expensive and limited.,1
"a bit on the expensive side, but if you can get a half price deal i'd say it's worth it.",1
one criticism is that the reading lessons in unit one are so ridiculously easy they feel like a waste of time,1
"i made an account for the japanese unit and my only issues is sometimes, the voice lessons don't work and you have to start the pp.",1
the other issue is that you can only do unit 1 without paying money.,1
"i got it to learn more english well and work on my pronunciation, so far i think it is working, the only down side is that you can't log onto another device until you log out in your other device.",1
i use this pp with my lawton the most and there has been instances where i forgets to log out and can't use the pp during my lunch at work on my phone or tablet.,1
i don't like that it can't be opened on multiple devices.,1
most certain to speaking.,1
"unless you have a professional level microphone, it will tell you that you failed the first time, but upon saying the word or phrase a second time, it will say you got it 100% correct.",1
"i do wish there was more help with pronunciation, like if i get a word wrong repetitively, i'd like to be given the option for extra physics help.",1
"i use domingo along with this, because being able to write(type) out words helps me learn them and that is one thing this pp is missing.",1
"also would be nice to have a ""general grammar rule"" section to reference for help.",1
"i like it a lot and it is really helpful to visualized and pronounce these words, but without telling you the definitions it can be difficult.",1
but some lessons seem not optimized for phone size as pictures seem too small or his allied with caution bubbles.,1
also seems to miss some of the desktop apes features like character selection.,1
for japanese there did not seem to be a way to tongue to only hiragana and karagina.,1
i wish they also translated what it all meant weather just have us guess ??,1
the only reason the pp is not five stars is because every once in a while it won't register my voice.,1
so i either fail or have to say a phrase or word multiple times for it to register.,1
"i do feel like the multiple choice makes it easy to make educated guesses, but maybe it works out in the long run.",1
i seem to have some issues though between singing.,1
"every time i open the pp it says congratulations on finishing week, even though i'm on week 3. there's a button that takes me to my latest though so it's not too much of a bother, but still weird.",1
the speech recognition is spot though.,1
"more interactive, work on conversation actually saying the words, like the speaking analyse so know saying it right.",1
just need to have short note why something right or wrong answer in grammar.,1
the program has a difficult time with speech recognition during exercises requiring me to respond verbally.,1
"but it'd be better if there were basic alphabet of the languages, plus, the words' translation (from pictures) into our selected native language.",1
recognition skill develop quickly but pronunciation skill need more work.,1
i am learning vietnamese some of the words don't mean the same thing.,1
it said that ong and ba is an older man or woman but i was corrected and told it's elderly man or woman.,1
it would be better for me if it focused on recreational words and phrases since my trip is for fun not business but it works,1
having a slight issue with the speech recognition but overall i love the new format.,1
some thumbnail photo are too small to be easily understood on a phone screen.,1
"good simple bite size learning you can fit around your day, hard to work out if the voice recognition issues are my microphone or the software.",1
"great pp, little prices but worth it!!!",1
4 stars only because the mobile doesn't include noweigen as an option yet!,1
"works pretty well on the mobile pp, just the occasional issue having to repeat into the mid.",1
would like more of a word to picture game for beginners.,1
i started using this pp to learn japanese for travel but i'm having issues fully understanding it just because it doesn't actually directly translate and tell me what each word means,1
seems to have trouble picking up my accent/tone.,1
i get some pronunciation correct but it says i did not.,1
"the teaching method is great, my only complaint is that there's not an easy way to review if you get out of the habit of studying.",1
"would like to see the games available via pp on the pp; otherwise, works as described!",1
"very good, albeit phone mid sometime gets drowned out by fan and other common absent noise",1
"i love it except that the accuracy bar doesn display when you reply words your struggling with, with make me struggle more.",1
sometimes voice detection hangs/laws making me repeat the phrase or word.,1
too much anti for the first lesson.,1
prefer more hiragana and katakana.,1
i turned off the microphone and now it doesn't enable it anymore.,1
singing between multiple devices needs to get a little better but overall good,1
this is a good language pp but it takes too long to load.,1
"i say the words, and it says, i said it wrong, ink what that's all about.",1
good pp sometimes laws behind and appears to get stuck occasionally but otherwise very useful,1
its done and kind fun but i really wish it could have nothing but argentina accent... but fun may to learn spanish...like i wish i could have an argentina setting a know,1
awesome so far but wish it had more free content.,1
some of the pictures are hard to make out.,1
other than the price of subscription it's perfect,1
excellent except the voice recognition is touch,1
its great the the words need to be pronounced more clearly!,1
doesn't really give the translation,1
although a great pp i wish it wasn't so expensive :(,1
pretty good for learning vietnamese although some prior knowledge of the language may be necessary,1
"it's too fast for a novice..please allow more time on pronunciation and grammar other than that, it's rrrr-eat!",1
right now a four just started simple but still a little slow when learning spanish,1
lost progress on phone.,1
i wish i could clock the full version but it is too expensive.,1
i need to log in every lesson,1
doesn't have all the features/lessons web does,1
i think this pp should add the meanings of the words before letting us say them,1
"it's slow, but fun.",1
good program but more like guessing game.,1
doesn't teach what i am exactly saying or grammar santa etc.,1
the pp is good just wish there was a latvia course then it would be 5 stars,1
the leagues make it a bit more competitive and motivation if you need it and the comments system allows you to learn from others as well.,2
"i think that the home screen with lessons is clear, and it is easy to switch between language courses.",2
"its built to teach both beginners and pro, and its smart to let the learner reply lessons that they previously completed.",2
what's really good about this pp is the fact that it's free.,2
"very helpful to hear and see at same time, fast and slow speed .",2
the use of hiragana while learning words makes the characters stick well.,2
"covers reading, hearing, writing, speaking, translating from and to.",2
"it's a powerful learning tool for sure, and the interface is intuition and well thought out.",2
very good pp for basic learning.,2
no boring lessons.,2
the new garlic course is well written and well thought out.,2
"it is a great pp, especially if you want to practice vocabulary.",2
"fun and quite adjective, which makes you want to keep using it.",2
lessons are quick and the as aren't terrible - just one at the end of each lesson.,2
"the pp is great, especially if you are learning from scratch, but there are one or two little singles that i found difficult to get past.",2
"having a fun time learning polish with this pp, its ad driven for revenue but the as are not in your face all the time which is nice, the learning format is fun and the progression is gentle.",2
love the incentive.,2
i signed up for the free trial and its a lot better.,2
this is a very good pp for learning different languages.,2
"excellent way to learn with listening, writing, and speaking a new language !",2
great variety of languages.,2
definitely a great learning tool and it plays like a game so it caps into the reward centers of the brain and keeps you coming back.,2
the syllabus is the best i've experienced with any language learning application i've tried.,2
you should supplement with outside sources to learn how natives actually speak.,2
editing my review because after updated i have seen great improvement with the pp.,2
i'm using a free version and it's pretty good considering it's free.,2
a great starting learning tool if you lack the proper time or schedule to take classes.,2
pretty good for learning vocabulary.,2
doesn't use that much data or space (unless you have plus and download courses).,2
it's great for a free pp and tries really hard to keep you motivate.,2
the free version comes with adds but they aren't too long and come at the end of the lessons rather that interrupting anything.,2
you can choose from a wide variety of languages to learn and the lessons are entertaining and challenging enough to keep you committed.,2
"very good for learning with much pictures, and it brings me lots of fun!",2
it is a blessing that it is free.,2
the as are few and not too annoying.,2
"it reaches you a language, for fun, for free.",2
"it offers a 7-day free trial for there upgrade to plus, and you can even compete on a leader board.",2
their points system keeps me motivate to keep learning!,2
i'm learning japanese and they integrate anti fearlessly into the lessons.,2
i love that it gives me daily accountability and that i can do a little or a lot on any given day.,2
pro: positive self-paced language pp that does a great job.,2
even the as are not overwhelming and horrible.,2
but in option there are many languages.,2
"helps you to learn to not only speak, but also properly pronounce the words also which is important.",2
categorizing the essentials seems to be very good.,2
very few stitches and the voices are clear most of the time.,2
i'm thrilled that there is a free pp for learning a language with such a smooth interface.,2
"best if used as a supplement to a bigger, more flushed out course.",2
"it's almost like playing a game, but i'm learning a language!",2
the paid version does offer a little more in terms of ease of use compared with the premium and helps to support a community of earners.,2
domingo is great to use if you are an aid traveler.,2
i like the easy set up and daily reminders.,2
"i like domingo because it makes you speak, read, and type your answers.",2
it also creates friendly competition to advance.,2
great pp for learning various languages.,2
occasionally frustration but i find the comments section usually explains any quires or stitches in the system.,2
"great for practicing a language that you're somewhat rusty on, but not that good for learning a new language from scratch.",2
"a bit slow, but aggressive in its reminders (which is exactly what i need in the busy times).",2
"so far its a great pp their are clot of option to choose from and you get the first core lessons free before having to purchase anything not, only that but it is actually really helpful with being able to hear the word rather than just reading it and the fact that if you get some words wrong you dont have to worry about starting the whole lesson over there is an option to go back through once you finish to fix any mistakes, they also put the words you struggle with in to a revision lesson",2
"it asks you your level of the language, what type of things you want to be learning (whether its the basis or tourist language).",2
"it judges your pronunciation and asks you to repeat things, as well as flash cards with visual and hearing and spelling.",2
lessons are interactive.,2
learning is more intuition than traditional lessons.,2
the best part is the pp lets you practice the sentences after you have used them to match the pictures.,2
it uses repetition to help understand the language.,2
it's really good for pronunciation and gets you speaking fast,2
it's very helpful when you are last-minute and need to learn quickly.,2
"adding pictures and pronunciation is probably what makes this pp so successful, one top of that the structure of learning is very good.",2
the pictures and repetition mean i really absorb the content.,2
it uses pictures to build associations between your new language and the word's meaning.,2
it also includes more speaking than other apes i've used as well as listening exercises where you can't read what's being said which is good practice for conversations.,2
"a lot of reviews mark it down for no translations which is the whole point of is, would recommend trying it",2
speech recognition works well.,2
no clashes or delayed response in lessons.,2
being a new user i liked the most part of this pp it has a very easy interface that a beginner can also use very smoothly and can be familiar with any new language he want to learn.this pp also lets us to learn new languages with a very easy method with a great convenience of time.,2
great native speakers.,2
starts with basic but engaging exercises.,2
easy to use and easy to alternate between the pp and the computer lessons.,2
being able to download lessons to use off line is handy,2
trial seems pretty helpful.,2
good pp for perfecting your pronunciation.,2
it breaks difficult words into syllables and sound to help.,2
helpful and images are great and easy to remember,2
very intuition and comprehensive.,2
challenging but fun!,2
"this pp is hard, but fun and worthwhile if you are willing to put two hours everyday into learning a language.",2
