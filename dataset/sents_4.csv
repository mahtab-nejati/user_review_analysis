duolingo,4,8,it's a great pp and i use it to practice my spanish even though i already take a class for it.
duolingo,4,8,they also have many other languages that i personally never knew existed.
duolingo,4,8,the only problem i've faced is the loading screen!
duolingo,4,8,it takes way too long and i'm sitting here with high speed internet.
duolingo,4,8,"between loading screens, maybe make a little mind game or something?"
duolingo,4,8,change up some of the pro tips (like tap to see another tip because they only show you one).
duolingo,4,8,just something to get me more hoped!
duolingo,4,8,!
duolingo,4,5,i've been using the pp for the past two years and i'm quite satisfied with it.
duolingo,4,5,only learning swedish for now but i love the fact it provides large vocabulary range and that setting up your own goals is great for learning at your own pace.
duolingo,4,5,there is competitiveness with the leagues which makes it more simulating and fun.
duolingo,4,5,i'm giving it 4 stars because of 2 things - the hearts and the lack of grammar explanations.
duolingo,4,5,"however, in the comments, admits/mode/people do take their time to do that for you."
duolingo,4,1,"the pp itself is a convenient learning tool, and i enjoy having a cup of coffee while learning a new language every day!"
duolingo,4,1,"my reason for not leaving 5 stars is because the pp and webster are so different, and i use both!"
duolingo,4,1,"in high valyrian, the grammar explanations dont exist in pp, but do in the webster."
duolingo,4,1,"in the pp you can ""break"" your completed lessons and restore them, but not in the webster."
duolingo,4,1,"also in the pp, some lessons are longer/shorter than on the webster."
duolingo,4,1,i'd like to get consistency
duolingo,4,5,"really great and fun, i just wish it would let us test out of what we already know, or speed up lessons, as they can be quite repetition and a little too easy [not true of languages that dont use your alphabet or dont share your roots, you need to already know the alphabet for those]."
duolingo,4,5,"otherwise, its the best free language pp out there, and its framed like a game and you can dress the owl up so that nice!"
duolingo,4,5,"very fun, would recommend"
duolingo,4,0,"⭐🦉domingo, in my opinion and experience, ist the number one pp for learning for example german."
duolingo,4,0,"organ for example it's more difficult for me, because i don't understand the characters so i make a lot of mistakes trying to guess the meaning and because i'm not premium, i waste hearts."
duolingo,4,0,"i know that practicing you earn hearts, but in this way it's difficult to advance."
duolingo,4,0,"eventough, that's something we can fix with premium!"
duolingo,4,0,and i'm considering it.
duolingo,4,0,this pp is total worth it!
duolingo,4,0,4'5/5!!
duolingo,4,0,!⭐ love 💖
duolingo,4,0,i got this pp to learn japanese so i could eventually play japanese games without goose translate.
duolingo,4,0,"the first couple lessons were focused mainly on a small set of characters and the sounds they made, with one or two simple words tossed in."
duolingo,4,0,"the next two lessons also have new characters in it, however are mostly focused on words, and not the new characters."
duolingo,4,0,"the only ""practice"" these lessons have for the new characters is a match the character to the sound."
duolingo,4,0,i can't learn with those.
duolingo,4,0,i really enjoy using this pp to learn organ.
duolingo,4,0,in the future i hope to also add japanese and chinese to the list.
duolingo,4,0,the only thing about this pp that i don't particularly like is that it doesn't really teach me how certain grammar points work.
duolingo,4,0,"besides that small concern, i'd definitely recommend domingo to people who want to learn a language 😊"
duolingo,4,3,"i love domingo, it's a great pp to help you learn a language at your own pace, and for free."
duolingo,4,3,"the only thing that i don't really agree with is the new 'life' system, when every mistake you make you loose a life, and once you have lost them all, you can't access different lessons, unless you wait his for another one, or you get domingo 'plus'."
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp.
duolingo,4,0,it's very helpful and rewarding.
duolingo,4,0,i don't mind the as in the free version.
duolingo,4,0,sometimes the lessons just don't load and stay on the loading screen.
duolingo,4,0,and random it will tell me i'm office when i'm not and then the lessons become blocked so i can't continue until it figures itself out.
duolingo,4,0,a really enjoyable and motivation way to learn spanish.
duolingo,4,0,i would have given it 5 stars if there was an option of using up english rather than us english.
duolingo,4,0,i often have to translate the us english used & this often requires annoying goose searches.
duolingo,4,0,"i didn't know people ask for ""the check"" in the us."
duolingo,4,0,"in the up we would ask for ""the bill""."
duolingo,4,0,it would be nice only having to concentrate on the spanish!
duolingo,4,0,"in a similar way, it would be nice to have the option of learning castilian spanish!"
duolingo,4,0,great way to learn in baby steps.
duolingo,4,0,the course is not meant to teach you from zero technically.
duolingo,4,0,they don't exactly start from abc of the language.
duolingo,4,0,but you do get to learn simple and common words.
duolingo,4,0,that's the reason for missing on the last star.
duolingo,4,0,"i have not used other similar apes, so won't do a comparison here."
duolingo,4,0,but this one is good in it's limited ways.
duolingo,4,0,ok good pp but could be better.
duolingo,4,0,the translations aunt always literal so it can get confusing between lessons.
duolingo,4,0,for example beau goose in french is literally beautiful kid.
duolingo,4,0,that pp tells you it means handsome because that is the implied meaning.
duolingo,4,0,but in another lesson both beau and goose pop up separately and may leave some confused.
duolingo,4,0,other than watching for that and double checking things like that the pp is great.
duolingo,4,0,this pp has gotten way better.
duolingo,4,0,they now have a 'tips' section where they explain explicitly many of the rules that it is trying to have you gain an implicit understanding of.
duolingo,4,0,the lessons seem way better.
duolingo,4,0,i love the stories option now where you can practice language with relevant little 'stories'.
duolingo,4,1,5 stars for the whole thing.
duolingo,4,1,4 stars for the pp.
duolingo,4,1,thanks a lot for adding the automatic selection of keyboard according to the language!
duolingo,4,1,i'd like to enjoy it more.
duolingo,4,1,but i'm still mostly using the web version (pp and phone) because i think the way it learns is better: it's better to write than to select words already written.
duolingo,4,1,let us the choice like with the web versions please!
duolingo,4,1,for any platform: more translations from the known language to the language being studied -> more difficult exercise.
duolingo,4,0,it is very easy and fun at first.
duolingo,4,0,except it does not actually teach you what the words mean for a while.
duolingo,4,0,"that's somewhat confusing, especially when it adds unknown words."
duolingo,4,0,you have to guess what the phrases say to translate.
duolingo,4,0,i have been stuck for days on a level because of this.
duolingo,4,0,it can be frustration and rewarding at the same time.
duolingo,4,0,please work on translating english to arabic words a little more.
duolingo,4,1,i have zero complaints about this pp.
duolingo,4,1,it's surprised me in a lot of ways.
duolingo,4,1,"4/5 because there are other good language apes that allow you to do speaking exercises (with domingo, you can only do those through the goose come brother, which is not as convenient as the pp) and that allow you to limitless progress (you have ""lives"" with domingo."
duolingo,4,1,meaning if you get enough things wrong during your learning (i.e.
duolingo,4,1,"lose a life), you can't progress without going back to practice lessons to earn more"
duolingo,4,42,very fun and simple to use!
duolingo,4,42,makes me so excited to start learning german again!
duolingo,4,42,"my only complaint right now is that whenever i try to speak in the mid for some of the lessons, it doesn't even bother recording and instantly says ""that doesn't sound right"" and then after 3 tries it fails me."
duolingo,4,42,i have microphone permission enabled.
duolingo,4,42,not sure why this is acting up.
duolingo,4,42,"so instead i've just been having to hit ""unable to speak"" so i don't lose a heart."
duolingo,4,0,wonderful to be able to access language learning at home and at a time to suit your own convenience.
duolingo,4,0,"sad to see the heart system in place, pushing people to opt for the plus option."
duolingo,4,0,"perhaps if this option was cheaper, more would access the service."
duolingo,4,0,"also, more explanation of why something is wrong would be very helpful."
duolingo,4,0,"but still, a great pp."
duolingo,4,0,heather
duolingo,4,1,i really like domingo but i would really like to see the office courses have an updated interface.
duolingo,4,1,it would be really helpful to customize and pick which courses you download office.
duolingo,4,1,"being in the navy, i am out to see a lot and i don't have phone data or wife for weeks at a time and my office content eventually runs out."
duolingo,4,1,please please please make this possible.
duolingo,4,1,this is one of the most advanced and best language learning apes.
duolingo,4,1,thing i dislike and why i did not give stars is its game like style.
duolingo,4,1,not each course is equally well done.
duolingo,4,1,japanese and german are very good.
duolingo,4,1,french is ok but the problem is the too strict english grammar in backward checks.
duolingo,4,1,hebrew seems to be made intentionally impossible to learn.
duolingo,4,1,"he,c,us, esp, i, p are good, but often the same problem as in french."
duolingo,4,1,also the check button is too large and i often touch it by mistake
duolingo,4,0,i download to learn makarin.
duolingo,4,0,it's good.
duolingo,4,0,i've learnt numbers and greetings.
duolingo,4,0,it random throws in things like characters and sounds and words.
duolingo,4,0,sometimes i'd forget what something means and have to wait for it to come back up when practicing rather than just looking at what it means.
duolingo,4,0,"for example i could recognise the numbers and match them to the characters and which were what numbers, but found it hard to just count to 10 on my own."
duolingo,4,0,however a lot of practicing helps
duolingo,4,1,"this is really fun to use, while it is useful as well."
duolingo,4,1,"i am trying to learn russian and i'm only having issues with using the microphone to speak the words, i feels like i'm saying it properly but it says incorrect i just brush it off."
duolingo,4,1,i would like to see if it could teach sign language or even bridle.
duolingo,4,1,overall pretty good
duolingo,4,1,i think this is a great pp.
duolingo,4,1,i've used it for years now.
duolingo,4,1,"my spanish still sucks, but that's on me, not do."
duolingo,4,1,i do still find it difficult to have conversations in spanish.
duolingo,4,1,i think the only way to really get conversation ready is to actually speak to a native speaker of the language.
duolingo,4,0,this is a great pp and makes learning another language quite easy.
duolingo,4,0,i have noticed a few errors such as it asks you to write what you hear in the language you are learning but then tells you you have written it in english when you haven't.
duolingo,4,0,"also you get 5 hearts per day which are for errors so once you have made 5 mistakes you can't go further without refilling them with gems, this can be at a cost if you haven't earn enough or if you make a lot of mistakes, which can hamper learning."
duolingo,4,1,"lots of repetition, but that's how you learn."
duolingo,4,1,"sometimes you are saying it, sometimes it is multiple choice, sometimes translating to english or vice versa."
duolingo,4,1,"i like that the lessons are short, and i can do as many as i want in a sitting."
duolingo,4,1,i plan to try another language after french.
duolingo,4,93,"so far, a very impressive pp."
duolingo,4,93,i'm learning how to use new words in sentences and grammar and spelling.
duolingo,4,93,the pp includes recording to teach pronunciation as well.
duolingo,4,93,i enjoy the strike system when i give the wrong answer it encourages me to really memories what i've learned.
duolingo,4,93,"i think it's best to take breaks in between lessons in order to digest what you've seen, rather than charming all at once."
duolingo,4,93,all of this for free- a very good pp indeed!
duolingo,4,93,the as are not jarring or irritating at all.
duolingo,4,0,"this pp is so handy to a beginner, and it could be a good companion in the journey of learning english at the beginning."
duolingo,4,0,"but there is room for improvement, some contents are quite tedious, it make me feel so bored to keep following the lessons."
duolingo,4,0,"thus, i rate 4 stars."
duolingo,4,0,wish that the team keep up the good work
duolingo,4,1,i love this pp although i have found an issue.
duolingo,4,1,"i am right now learning organ , but a feature i've noticed is that when you choose the answer or complete the level it doesn't tell you what it means so you're just learning how to say it but not knowing what it means which is a problem since in trying to learn how before i move to more"
duolingo,4,0,"i love how encouraging it is, and how simple the lessons."
duolingo,4,0,"i like how the lesson gives me again the ones i did wrong, without comment."
duolingo,4,0,i would love to see the little owl wave at me on my home screen at a time i schedule in my day so i anticipate it.
duolingo,4,0,the red letters when mistakes are made might be thought.
duolingo,4,0,mistakes aren't evil they may be due to carelessness or just need to be programme into the brain a few more times.
duolingo,4,0,but there should not be shame involved.
duolingo,4,0,everyone wants to do well.
duolingo,4,0,love it.
duolingo,4,0,"it helps me learn spanish more easily, i've learned so many new words.. but the thing is, carry should be changed to come.. in spanish, the word 'come' for car is favoured more (i learnt it in school) and carry is more used towards a cart?"
duolingo,4,0,please just change that word.
duolingo,4,0,edit: please can you add a page where all the words you've learn in lessons are added on that page with the topic name of where those words come from: e.g travelling vicar aeropuerto el malta food quest hero
duolingo,4,0,"it's good, i learnt spanish quite quickly but there's something up with the microphone part."
duolingo,4,0,"it use to work for me when i use to use it but now whenever i press it, it says it doesn't work :( could you fix that for me please?"
duolingo,4,0,also i'd like to see more variety on learning.
duolingo,4,0,so far there's only stories and classic lessons but it would be cool to have other ways too
duolingo,4,0,as a virtual beginner it has given me a good start.
duolingo,4,0,i find i can now read french somewhat but have some difficulty with understanding speech at normal pace.
duolingo,4,0,slow speech i can deal with.
duolingo,4,0,sometimes the voice audit is not brilliant.
duolingo,4,0,as a bit i have had to also learn american english.
duolingo,4,0,but that's fine.
duolingo,4,16,domingo is an amazing pp for learning a new language!
duolingo,4,16,there is nothing i dislike about the pp.
duolingo,4,16,the only problem i've come across is this weird pitch.
duolingo,4,16,"when i open the pp, it often says ""there was a problem with the connection"" even though my wife is fine and i can access other wife required applications just fine."
duolingo,4,16,it may be a server thing.
duolingo,4,16,"but besides that, this pp is definitely worth your time!"
duolingo,4,16,i highly recommend it.
duolingo,4,3,fun.
duolingo,4,3,easy to use.
duolingo,4,3,i think it helps to see the russian spelling of the words.
duolingo,4,3,"however, it needs to teach the russian alphabet first i think."
duolingo,4,3,so i suggest you do that on your own.
duolingo,4,3,"i would like to be able to play the phase after i select the russian words for it, but if you click check you can't."
duolingo,4,3,"overall it's good for a free pp, but i never used roseola stone so i don't know what i'm missing."
duolingo,4,1,"the pp seems pretty good, lots of repetition, which is necessary to learn a new language."
duolingo,4,1,"they just kind of speak in new words here and there, so the vocabulary increases little by little."
duolingo,4,1,"the only thing is, i don't understand how the crowns that we earn are used."
duolingo,4,1,i wish the pp would explain better
duolingo,4,0,i enjoy the pp regularly but there has been an update that makes finishing some lessons impossible on my phone (samson).
duolingo,4,0,and problems i had in the past weren't replied to via email.
duolingo,4,0,other than that my experience has been pretty good.
duolingo,4,0,(i think developer have fixed that issue.
duolingo,4,0,have not had it recently 1/17/20)
duolingo,4,1,a pleasure to use and fun at the same time.
duolingo,4,1,the leagues make it a bit more competitive and motivation if you need it and the comments system allows you to learn from others as well.
duolingo,4,1,quite adjective once you move up the leagues.
duolingo,4,1,personally i would prefer more spoken challenges but otherwise a great pp!
duolingo,4,3,"very good pp, good lessons design, balanced and very adjective, unfortunately like for other apes you need to pay to get unlimited time and avert free, but for beginning is more than you need, before you use all hearts its enough to learn the pp and decide if you want to buy premium, i will definitely, knowledge is priceless!"
duolingo,4,3,4 stars :)
duolingo,4,0,domingo is a great pp for casual and on the go people who want to learn a new language.
duolingo,4,0,"i think that the home screen with lessons is clear, and it is easy to switch between language courses."
duolingo,4,0,"its built to teach both beginners and pro, and its smart to let the learner reply lessons that they previously completed."
duolingo,4,0,i do think that do would benefit from teaching the letters or alphabet in the languages that use an alphabet.
duolingo,4,0,this is a very helpful pp for learning any language.
duolingo,4,0,it's super fun and very interesting.
duolingo,4,0,the only problem is felt is that it shows that the heart will replenished in 5 hours but even after leaving it for whole night.
duolingo,4,0,it never goes beyond one.
duolingo,4,0,really good if you speak english and are not trying to learn a language with a different alphabet.
duolingo,4,0,"but the option you have if you are speaking german are very limited... they keep adding languages though, so let's hope for the best!"
duolingo,4,0,:)
duolingo,4,1,a fun way to practice your language.
duolingo,4,1,i am studying french with a teacher and use domingo as a small additional resource to support my learning process.
duolingo,4,1,"i particularly like when something of my actual lessons is repeated in the pp, and i actually know what it's about!"
duolingo,4,1,"good for vocal, but wouldn't use it as a sole source personally."
duolingo,4,0,"good but a bit too much repetition sometimes maybe not in all languages , but it is in the language i am learning."
duolingo,4,0,there is still a lot of room for development in this pp it is good but they can make it amazing.
duolingo,4,0,i honestly like it and use it everyday.
duolingo,4,0,"i started turkish and a friend of mine started spanish, in this pp he has few more option than i."
duolingo,4,3,great selection of languages.
duolingo,4,3,"pp is free, but you can upgrade to get no as and some other peaks."
duolingo,4,3,"even with free version, you get the same content, so you won't learn faster or better or more with paid version."
duolingo,4,3,"you can compete with others, but the competition is more based on how long you spend on lessons and your consistency as opposed to who knows a given language better."
duolingo,4,3,awesome pp if you want to learn a language but don't want to drop hundreds of dollars on a class or a paid program.
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp for learning italian.
duolingo,4,0,"i wish that there weren't points and other unnecessary ""fluff."""
duolingo,4,0,"i don't need it to be a game, i just want to lean the language."
duolingo,4,0,"it's very helpful though and the variety of speaking, writing, reading, and watching opportunities keeps it interesting."
duolingo,4,0,i would prefer slightly more in the way of questions requiring you to pull words entirely from memory and in full sentences (as opposed to watching pairs or filling a sentence in from a pool of potential words).
duolingo,4,0,"however, overall i am really enjoying using the pp and feel like i'm progressing towards fleecy in german."
duolingo,4,2,great pp!
duolingo,4,2,"helps me learn the language that i want, but is a little confusing."
duolingo,4,2,"i wish there were ""pronunciation video"" or a ""how to pronounce button."""
duolingo,4,2,"i'm having a bit of trouble with some of the words, either they say the words to fast or its hard to pronounce."
duolingo,4,0,i love a lot about it.certain things can bare fixing and better explanation.
duolingo,4,0,"example, give been taking japanese now for a about 5 months, so i no natasha is feminine way of saying i, and only used by men in formal situations."
duolingo,4,0,"ore and you are typically used strictly by men and if i remember, ore tends to lean formal, you in."
duolingo,4,0,"by the way, in japanese, sayanaro is a very sad phrase u say when all never see someone again, like, when u're dying."
duolingo,4,0,i highly recommend fixing as much as possible.
duolingo,4,15,the pp is better with uncommon languages.
duolingo,4,15,"spanish, for example, has a limit on what you can learn per day, which doesn't exist on some other languages."
duolingo,4,15,but the drawback of those uncommon languages is inconsistent audit clips.
duolingo,4,15,some sound like they're from the inside of a tin can and are really hard to make out.
duolingo,4,15,"it's a fun pp, and adjective."
duolingo,4,15,worth checking out at any rate.
duolingo,4,0,"greatest pp on the market for learning a language, and it's completely free!"
duolingo,4,0,"but it would be even better if it also had the ""tips"" section like in the desktop version, the one where grammar rules etc is explained in more detail."
duolingo,4,0,that would make things much easier.
duolingo,4,0,"until then, 4 stars."
duolingo,4,0,this pp is really great for beginners to learn new languages but that is also its limit.
duolingo,4,0,what's really good about this pp is the fact that it's free.
duolingo,4,0,"you have a 5 heart system that if you lose all your hearts, then you either buy domingo plus or you can take more practice, to earn 1 heart back."
duolingo,4,0,the practice tests are unlimited giving you a truly free experience while also encouraging you to practice your language more.
duolingo,4,6,i really like this pp and it helped me immensely to learn italian.
duolingo,4,6,"i am using it currently to study russian, but it really annoy me that there aren't any ""tips"" like in the desktop version."
duolingo,4,6,"it would be really, really useful to have it in the mobile version too."
duolingo,4,6,"also the shop has few things to buy, you could also give that an update."
duolingo,4,6,these are the only things that stop me giving this pp 5 stars.
duolingo,4,0,i kind of only download it for the meme and i was pleasantly surprised by how amazing this pp actually is!
duolingo,4,0,it's easy to use and makes it has a lot of languages to learn!
duolingo,4,0,it works amazing and i use it to practice my japanese.
duolingo,4,0,it's a great learning pp but i do have some comments.
duolingo,4,0,i think there could be a bit more explanation because sometimes i have need to goose stuff because it isn't explained in the pp.
duolingo,4,0,"also the japanese pronunciation are a bit off sometimes, but i still love it!"
duolingo,4,0,"definitely good start into languages, not sure the repetition engine (i have rather bad memory) so i use supermemo own flashcards as boost."
duolingo,4,0,if you think about learning language use it.
duolingo,4,0,i tried twice but the real start was domingo.
duolingo,4,0,"what i do not like is mostly repetition the whole lesson (chapter) , it gives you the picture of eg the car with easy choice of an answer and next asks you how is the car in learned language so you answer which gives you false impression that you know this word."
duolingo,4,1,love it & just want to keep playing!
duolingo,4,1,just wish i could retaken the placement test.
duolingo,4,1,i feel something went wrong.
duolingo,4,1,"when my fiance & i took one together on his phone, the questions were much harder & i knew most of them & it put us at a significant higher level then the test that was on my phone& i did alone."
duolingo,4,1,what gives?
duolingo,4,0,minor issues but mostly great.
duolingo,4,0,"the main issue is that when i spend lights to test out of different lessons, my progress is lost within a few minutes after i pass."
duolingo,4,0,there are just a few subjects that do this every time i make it to gold.
duolingo,4,0,domingo is a great resource for learning new languages.
duolingo,4,0,i am currently learning french.
duolingo,4,0,i have one problem though.
duolingo,4,0,the pp is restricting me from proceeding forward with my lessons because i am apparently getting an answer incorrect.
duolingo,4,0,i have checked the correct answer multiple times and retired the question.
duolingo,4,0,"everytime i answer,with what should be correct, i get the wrong answer button."
duolingo,4,0,i'm extremely agitated with what is happening and hope the problem gets fixed.
duolingo,4,9,"this is a very good pp for learning a language, especially since it is free."
duolingo,4,9,i have been learning spanish in class for 7 years and i often find that it helps me brush up on certain skill.
duolingo,4,9,"however, i wish that they would offer more advanced content sometimes."
duolingo,4,9,"for example, they often have you translating a spanish sentence to english, however i feel that we should be practicing translating from english to spanish."
duolingo,4,9,"we need to be able to produce the language we're learning, not the client one"
duolingo,4,2,"domingo is a great language learning pp, but it's not perfect."
duolingo,4,2,"i am learning chinese and japanese and domingo has taught me how to read, hear, and talk; however it didn't teach me how to write."
duolingo,4,2,users are also not able to customize the theme of the pp or change the voices of narrators.
duolingo,4,2,"on the bright side, tests are simple and beginner-friendly, but it won't allow you to be very proficient in the language you learn."
duolingo,4,2,"it gives tips on each lesson module, but there are no external links embedded."
duolingo,4,6,easily one of the best language learning apes.
duolingo,4,6,"huge motivation and well paced, with a great selection of languages."
duolingo,4,6,"the one issue i've run into is that i have no need to learn to read the languages i'm learning, but there's no way to include transliterations with native text (or turn off reading questions), so any reading question that doesn't include the ability to press a word for the audit becomes a guessing game."
duolingo,4,6,4 or 5 of those questions in a row really details a study session.
duolingo,4,0,"good, could be better if we could save up more then 5 hearts in the free edition, or less time for hearts to replenished."
duolingo,4,0,"otherwise, in general pretty good pp, also i got a translate this sentence question wrong because of my capitalisation (from russian-> english) once :[ but i guess that fair since english is the language i do know, kind."
duolingo,4,0,p.s.
duolingo,4,0,i recommend learning russian if your american so when we get enslaved by put we wont get worked as hard in the zoology.
duolingo,4,0,:)))
duolingo,4,0,i find this an incredible resource for learning french and for school and it has improved my language skill immensely.
duolingo,4,0,the addition of the stories to french have made it much more enjoyable.
duolingo,4,0,and the leaderboard adds a bit of competition which motivate me to keep going.
duolingo,4,0,"i do wish the irish was better, i cannot access the game notes on the pp on the phone, there isn't much auditory to learn the sounds and there wasn't an addition of stories."
duolingo,4,0,hopefully this will change with a further update.
duolingo,4,3,"i love this pp, but i have a complaint; this is directed at the hebrew course for english speakers - why is there no option to learn the letters?"
duolingo,4,3,"the first lesson is called letters, but it doesn't actually teach you the letters."
duolingo,4,3,"i can't learn this language if i can't read it, and there is no option for an alphabet guide."
duolingo,4,3,the languages that don't use familiar characters are frustration because there is no reference for those unfamiliar characters.
duolingo,4,3,"i actually enjoy this pp quite a bit, the reason why i gave it four stars is because there was a pop-up advertisement that said if you got your friends to join that you would get a week of free unlimited access."
duolingo,4,3,i got two of my friends to join which means i should have two weeks of unlimited access yet for whatever reason this does not appear to be the case.
duolingo,4,3,"any assistance to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated, dance schon!"
duolingo,4,1,"domingo is a very nice, efficient pp for learning languages, which has become a hobby for me now."
duolingo,4,1,"something happened, though, and unfortunately i can't give my full 5 stars."
duolingo,4,1,"i took a test to advance through a lesson which i already know enough about, which i had to use 5 lights for."
duolingo,4,1,pp crashed in the middle of the quit.
duolingo,4,1,"once i restarted the pp, i'd lost the lights and need to use 5 more lights again."
duolingo,4,1,can something be done about this?
duolingo,4,1,i love this pp!
duolingo,4,1,"i'm learning latin, because as a writer, it's something that i've always wanted to do."
duolingo,4,1,"domingo is terrific for folks like me, who instinctively ""get"" language and how it's structures."
duolingo,4,1,"the only thing i think that would make the pp better is not only a translation, but a brief explanation of your error when you get something wrong."
duolingo,4,1,that's it.
duolingo,4,1,the hardest thing about domingo for me is slowing down so i don't get too frustrated - but that's completely on me.
duolingo,4,0,it's been a good year learning with domingo.
duolingo,4,0,i wish every language had the same stuff as others.
duolingo,4,0,"i hear some languages get ""stories"", which sounds interesting."
duolingo,4,0,"on the plus side, japanese (my chosen language to learn) is getting another update early this year."
duolingo,4,0,"it would be cool to try out the is characters because that sounds more engaging, alas i'm on andros."
duolingo,4,0,"lights don't get much use at the moment, so it would be good to see a way of utilizing them more."
duolingo,4,0,"thanks for teaching me, do."
duolingo,4,0,ありがとう！
duolingo,4,16,fantastic pp.
duolingo,4,16,"if you want to learn a language, and quickly and easily, this is the pp for you!"
duolingo,4,16,"i wish i could contribute to free education but i can't afford it with the cost of life, adding another $12 (and) pm is too much."
duolingo,4,16,"i understand you need to get paid but give me a monthly subscription of say $2-3, with the option of paying it all front?"
duolingo,4,16,i would pay that.
duolingo,4,16,and probe not even use the pp for a year.. just putting it out there is pay $papa
duolingo,4,2,it's been okay.
duolingo,4,2,maybe there should be tips when things are wrong because based on previous lessons you would swear your answer is correct then to find out there is some hidden rule.
duolingo,4,2,i think some of the lessons are way too repetition and it takes forever to finish a tier.
duolingo,4,2,but it is quite helpful .
duolingo,4,2,ink how we can make it more interactive though .
duolingo,4,2,perhaps a chat?
duolingo,4,1,very good learning pp but it needs an option for a family subscription if there is more than one person learning.
duolingo,4,1,"i don't like the ""limited hearts"" system that penalties mistakes."
duolingo,4,1,i do like the fact that my plus subscription covers more than one language - great for refreshing school languages as well as learning new.
duolingo,4,1,really enjoy daily lessons
duolingo,4,1,"the only real downside is that it is constantly trying to game-if things, and i'm a college student who really doesn't need constant distractions from the pp notifying me about leader boards and pushing for my valuable time- i don't have a single reminder that i could set to daily, weekly, whatever, but it's kind overboard right now."
duolingo,4,3,makes it fun to learn another language i did not give 5 stars as i feel that there still room for improvement.
duolingo,4,3,"one suggestion is to have more tips, guideline especially when it comes to sentence construction."
duolingo,4,3,"i am studying japanese now, and i have to regularly goose to understand some concepts (wa, ga, ka, etc)."
duolingo,4,3,"there is a forum and while the comments are useful, i can't always filter which is exactly an ""opinion"" or an actual correct answer.."
duolingo,4,5,great pp!
duolingo,4,5,lots of fun to learn on it and clean graphics.
duolingo,4,5,"i wish they had more 'side lessons' you could get with the rubles etc, as well as even more languages."
duolingo,4,5,"i also think it'd be good to include more in the beginning lesson brief before each circle, sometimes you're just guessing what a word means based on the option because it just wasn't covered."
duolingo,4,5,more visual kinds of learning would also be great.
duolingo,4,5,but overall would still recommend!
duolingo,4,0,"all round it is a wonderful pp, i have been using it for the past time now and it really motivate you to study everyday and not only that it make sure you grasp the knowledge of the language and gives you award for studying hard."
duolingo,4,0,also it refreshed your past courses to make sure you don't forget what you have learnt.
duolingo,4,4,this is really a handy little pp to help teach you language basis.
duolingo,4,4,easy to get the hang of.
duolingo,4,4,quick to introduce higher level content.
duolingo,4,4,my only issue is how hard they push the paid program.
duolingo,4,4,it feels like the free pp is more of an advertisement/trial for the paid pp.
duolingo,4,4,in the free pp you have 5 mistakes before you have to wait 4 hours to move on.
duolingo,4,4,paid pp there isn't a counter.
duolingo,4,4,"paid pp offers office content, free pp doesn't."
duolingo,4,4,free pp has tons of advertisements.
duolingo,4,0,can you add a feature that lets you save progress you made in an exercise?
duolingo,4,0,some of the tying exercises take me some time and unfortunately if i get cut short i have to start them.
duolingo,4,0,i dont need a specific exercise saved.
duolingo,4,0,its enough that you just start the exercise but with the number give done right already allocate so i dont lose progress.
duolingo,4,2,fun and adjective.
duolingo,4,2,i have my doubts i'm saying things correctly.
duolingo,4,2,there doesn't seem to be a way to check that within the pp even though i'm using headphones with a microphone.
duolingo,4,2,at this point i suspect i'll be able to understand more than i can speak at the end of this language course.
duolingo,4,2,but i'm having fun.
duolingo,4,1,i started using this pp once before but quit because i didn't find it helpful.
duolingo,4,1,"however, i have begun to use it again and find that the more involved in the lessons the more you learn."
duolingo,4,1,as you progress you are not just selecting an easy picture as a response to a word.
duolingo,4,1,i would have given a fifth star if the in game currency had more uses.
duolingo,4,1,very easy to buy the three items.
duolingo,4,0,"its great for me, but my sister's version suddenly has hearts while mine doesn't, and i don't understand why?"
duolingo,4,0,what is the purpose of these hearts?
duolingo,4,0,in my opinion they're merely hindering the learning experience.
duolingo,4,0,when i saw the feature my enjoyment for this pp suddenly decreased.
duolingo,4,0,"please take it away, its not doing you any favors."
duolingo,4,1,this is a solid pp for getting an introduction to just about any language.
duolingo,4,1,i like to practice with this pp for a couple of months before i go an international trip so that i'm not completely lost when i arrive.
duolingo,4,1,i gave it 4 stars because there are bags from time to time.
duolingo,4,1,"foi the sound won't play or the images won't show, but it's rare, and not unusual for a free pp."
duolingo,4,1,the thing i really don't like is that there is no way to report these bags!
duolingo,4,1,"otherwise, i think this is a great and useful pp"
duolingo,4,2,this is a great pp and i am enjoying using it and learning french.
duolingo,4,2,my only problem with it is that it uses american english and wants me to translate french into the american equivalent.
duolingo,4,2,"we don't call the underground the subways and we call them shops not stores, we go to the cinema, not the moves and then there is the clothes issue etc."
duolingo,4,2,i don't want to be told i am giving the wrong translation when i am english and i am providing the correct up english translation.
duolingo,4,5,i started with domingo several years ago when it first came out.
duolingo,4,5,the learning design has improved practically.
duolingo,4,5,"the pp used to be harshly punitive on earners who did not practice every day, which i found deeply disheartening."
duolingo,4,5,now the multi-tired reward system encourages earners to come back for more.
duolingo,4,5,the program now features better corrections and practical grammar.
duolingo,4,5,i am very happy with the work the domingo team has put in to make this pp the best learning experience possible.
duolingo,4,0,"great pp, obviously v good programming, i have experienced no technical problems at all, and love the overall design."
duolingo,4,0,"users just need to be aware that there is a lot of repetition, if this is not your learning style, it might not be the right pp for you."
duolingo,4,0,"this is a great webster and pp, and i really appreciate how it works without buying plus."
duolingo,4,0,it's helped me learn a lot of spanish.
duolingo,4,0,"(stories being made available on the pp is great, thank you.)"
duolingo,4,0,"one thing: please, please change it so if we start a lesson before midnight (and when we finish, it's past that), we don't lose our streak."
duolingo,4,0,"it is very bothering and discouraging, especially because the point of streaks is putting in effort every day, and starting a lesson is certainly putting in effort."
duolingo,4,3,really well-paced lesson structure that regularly judges you to keep up the regular practice required to actually learn a new language (or multiple languages if you fancy it).
duolingo,4,3,"the league system this pp employs gives a competitive sense that encourages further improvement, too."
duolingo,4,3,"i will say that the regular nudging can get a like annoying sometimes, though."
duolingo,4,3,"perhaps that is an effective way to good one into learning more, but it does tend to fill one's email into."
duolingo,4,2,i love it!
duolingo,4,2,"however it would be nice if you could set your sleeping time, because i always practice right before sleeping, which is usually around pm- am."
duolingo,4,2,because of that it often kills my streak because its just past midnight.
duolingo,4,2,also the feedback function just wanted me to share my opinion together with the current pp version to my friends.
duolingo,4,2,please look into it.
duolingo,4,2,this pp has been really good at giving some basic lessons.
duolingo,4,2,"a couple of things that would make it even better though; being able to look over past lessons for reminders if you haven't been on the pp for a while, and have some sort of vocal dictionary of all of the words you've learnt so far."
duolingo,4,2,other than that i've found this pp really useful at learning some key vocal and sentences.
duolingo,4,0,i like the way the leaderboard works.
duolingo,4,0,it gets you motivate.
duolingo,4,0,but the way this reaches you can be a bit confusing.
duolingo,4,0,for example i am learning japanese and at the beginning i was learning some numbers but it taught me 1 through 7 except 5. that just doesn't make since.
duolingo,4,1,it's a great way to keep your mind active and learn another language.
duolingo,4,1,there is room for improvement though.
duolingo,4,1,"i think if they made it so you could hear the sound of new words /phrases when they're presented it would help learn faster, in my opinion."
duolingo,4,1,"also it would be beneficial if you could chat with others, perhaps someone that speaks the language you're learning to help get used to writing in a conversational manner and someone trying to learn our language could chat with us for practice too."
duolingo,4,1,highly adjective and fun way to learn.
duolingo,4,1,"only improvement would be to describe new words, and how they are used, as they are introduced."
duolingo,4,1,"it can be quite frustration, running out of lives, trying to guess what a new word means."
duolingo,4,0,this pp is one of the best useful pp that i have ever known!
duolingo,4,0,but recently it has a big problem i can't hear a voice of speaker so i can't know the correct pronunciation!
duolingo,4,0,"i updated it,i delete and again installed,i loved out many times,i used headphones!"
duolingo,4,0,but it didn't work do you know what is the problem?
duolingo,4,0,i should work had but with this dilemma i can't :(
duolingo,4,0,"it is a fun, quick learning pp."
duolingo,4,0,as someone who was client who is trying to regain skill it takes quite some time to get to some challenging exercises even with the paid version.
duolingo,4,0,i'm not sure how well it would work if i didn't already know a lot of the language.
duolingo,4,0,it would be good to introduce new words with pictures of video as direct translation is not the best way to truly learn a language.
duolingo,4,0,"overall, this program is fantastic, and quite fun."
duolingo,4,0,what prevents me from giving a 5/5 is the fact that it's sometimes hard to figure out how to pronounce certain letters.
duolingo,4,0,"an guide on how to announce, or a poetic breakdown of words would be an amazing help."
duolingo,4,0,"this pp is great if you want to learn another language, whether you have virtually no time or a ton of time."
duolingo,4,0,"it has a very wide variety of languages, including endangered languages, such as naval, and hawaiian."
duolingo,4,0,"the only thing i dislike is the heart or life system, i don't understand why if i get it wrong, i need to use gems or practice, or whatever to complete another lesson."
duolingo,4,0,over all this pp is amazing and i total recommend installing this and using it daily.
duolingo,4,0,absolutely outstanding <3 this
duolingo,4,0,"the pp is great, but for such an established company i was expecting more in terms of transitioning from casual learning to more serious, i.e."
duolingo,4,0,"weekly email with lists of words learned, breakdown if lessons , etc."
duolingo,4,0,i would gladly pay for that.
duolingo,4,0,the lessons are great thought for casual learning.
duolingo,4,0,au wiedersehen!
duolingo,4,0,it's really great pp to learn new languages and it's quite helpful but there's bug that doesn't let the pp to play the pronunciation of the sentences and i don't know how to fix it and it's really annoying cause i can't listen to the voices which are on the pp!
duolingo,4,0,please take care of it.
duolingo,4,0,thank you.
duolingo,4,0,"this pp is fun way to learn new language, they focus on read, write, speak in way of quit/puzzle/paring which keeps you engrossed and keep learning and scoring."
duolingo,4,0,my only suggestion is to them is to make this pp more strong on pronunciation learning.
duolingo,4,0,"overall, happy to use this fun free learning pp."
duolingo,4,0,a breeze to use.
duolingo,4,0,although occasionally it's strange that the quit questions are already answered in proper order.
duolingo,4,0,wondering if it's a pitch or oversight.
duolingo,4,0,"other than that, the pp has been great and has helped immensely in my acquisition of the language."
duolingo,4,0,this pp is great and very easy to learn with.
duolingo,4,0,however i have a major problem with it.
duolingo,4,0,i cannot advance any more because i cannot reach the buttons with the answers and nor can i stroll down to reach them.
duolingo,4,0,i am using a blackberry and perhaps the keyboard and shortened screen are the cause of this.
duolingo,4,0,but perhaps this can be fixed?
duolingo,4,1,it's the best language pp that there is!
duolingo,4,1,"👍but, you do need lives."
duolingo,4,1,"i just don't agree with the idea that you need to do a practice test, to get more lives once you have used them all."
duolingo,4,1,"also, the people who speak, so that you can answer are hard to hear/understand properly."
duolingo,4,1,thank you for creating domingo + the 🦉is so cut.
duolingo,4,1,x x x
duolingo,4,12,so happy to learn scottish garlic but the american english requires a level of translation for english.
duolingo,4,12,"a bit buggy in the andros, how i was taught to pronounce things at garlic classes by native speakers in glasgow can be different as well as different phrases."
duolingo,4,12,"but i do love the format, ease of use, cracking of progress and my vocabulary is growing."
duolingo,4,12,thank you!
duolingo,4,0,"really helpful overall, with a few issues."
duolingo,4,0,"i'm doing the japanese lessons, and there a couple of things other users have mentioned as not quite correct."
duolingo,4,0,"as long as you do the research on your own, you can figure these issues out."
duolingo,4,0,"overall, fun and useful!"
duolingo,4,0,it's pretty good.
duolingo,4,0,the only thing i would change is the lives.
duolingo,4,0,it's annoying to mess up 5 times and have to wait so long for lives again.
duolingo,4,0,i wish you could just watch an ad for them all back.
duolingo,4,0,"also when i was trying to learn hebrew, it would have been nice if they taught the letters better."
duolingo,4,0,and individually.
duolingo,4,0,"it's a easy pp to deal with..you can learn a language at home saving money and time, it's good!!"
duolingo,4,0,there are some problems like limits of hearts if you don't sign it .. but it's ok i recommend it!
duolingo,4,0,!
duolingo,4,0,this pp is a great way to learn how the speak in a different language.
duolingo,4,0,my only problem is that if you take a break off the pp then when you come back you might not remember clot of the translations.
duolingo,4,0,it might be better if you were put back a level or two once you've had a break.
duolingo,4,0,may not be equal to a fully comprehensive language course but does a very good job of introducing the beginner and intermediate levels of learning a language.
duolingo,4,0,though i wish there were more guides to help learn new pronunciation.
duolingo,4,0,overall a good pp worth your time
duolingo,4,0,a good pp but would maybe be better being taught about the verbs and sentence construction at the start of a course.
duolingo,4,0,also a dictionary you could access to see what words you have learned for reference would be really good as well.
duolingo,4,0,has a wide variety of languages that reaches a good spread of vocal.
duolingo,4,0,you are expected to pick up grammar as you go which can get difficult with some languages.
duolingo,4,0,it has a decent amount of updated and a great online community.
duolingo,4,0,my only issue is the courses being too short to learn to a high standard only from this pp.
duolingo,4,0,would recommend to users discovering their passion and sharing experience without investing money
duolingo,4,1,4 instead of 5 stars due to no context being given (but i'm getting that elsewhere).
duolingo,4,1,"would be three as sometimes i get something wrong for a type, but other times i get something right with a type."
duolingo,4,1,"other small issues, too, but back up to four stars for overall being highly effective."
duolingo,4,0,it's kind of admitting.
duolingo,4,0,there's usually an owl that pips out during the exercises for encouragement.
duolingo,4,0,i work really hard and pay for plus and used 1000 gems to get the super do owl and now there is no owl at all.
duolingo,4,0,i have checked my settings.
duolingo,4,0,i'm upset that i lost 1000 gems for nothing.
duolingo,4,0,so only 4 stars till i see my super owl.
duolingo,4,0,definitely recommend for a serious practice that you can enjoy at the same time.
duolingo,4,0,"i'm currently working on 4 languages and i could never have imagined that before, especially without any major stitches."
duolingo,4,12,very useful pp.
duolingo,4,12,"what is a little frustration though is that they don't really have ""lessons"" - everything is a quit, so you learn new vocabulary by guessing right or answering wrong."
duolingo,4,12,"i haven't had any grammar reasons from domingo, but as a supplementary tool to a language program, i definitely recommend it."
duolingo,4,0,i tell you it is worth the paid version i was frustrated with the free version i love this pp it has really helped me expand my vocabulary and understand verbs the only reason why it's not five stars is because i'm not that great at spanish yet ll and i think it would be nice to have practice conversations somehow in the pp not just random things like your cat is pretty.
duolingo,4,0,ok... domingo was one of my favorite apes.
duolingo,4,0,but lately i'm having problems with it...like when i'm doing the listening exercise and it doesn't play!...
duolingo,4,0,and the newest problem is that it doesn't even load the lesson!!
duolingo,4,0,any suggestions to make it work?
duolingo,4,0,"easy to use , i like the league option help you to keep motivate ."
duolingo,4,0,wanted chat option also or you make another pp for chatting using domingo id it will going to be fun .
duolingo,4,0,we all know some people do abusive use of chat option but it will going to be helpful .you have to find a way.
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp!
duolingo,4,0,it made me learn so much french but i gave it a 4 because i think the 5 lives are kind of putting pressure on people who make mistakes clot.
duolingo,4,0,my daughter uses thus pp for her gase and she already is in a clot of pressure from the revision and the n 5 lives makes more pressure.
duolingo,4,0,you should learn from your mistakes though.
duolingo,4,0,overall i love this pp.
duolingo,4,0,😀
duolingo,4,0,using just the free version now.
duolingo,4,0,sometimes i can finish a lesson sometimes i can not because i run out of heart's.
duolingo,4,0,i think it is because sometimes i get top many wrong answers.
duolingo,4,0,you automatically get them repleni6the next day.
duolingo,4,0,"i plan on trying the paid version down the road, closer to my trip."
duolingo,4,0,i enjoy domingo.
duolingo,4,0,i feel like my main problem and only problem is that sometimes it gives me new words that i haven't learned yet and doesn't really explain them.
duolingo,4,0,i really like the streak system because now i know how long i've been doing this.
duolingo,4,0,i currently have a 152 day streak.
duolingo,4,0,an excellent tool to grow your vocabulary and a starting point to learn a wider language.
duolingo,4,0,unfortunately you only get 5 possible mistakes before you need to wait for them to regenerate (once every 4 hours) or buy a refill with in pp purchases (some with in pp currency) a great starting point but other learning tools are required
duolingo,4,0,this is my favorite language pp.
duolingo,4,0,it is very user friendly.
duolingo,4,0,"i was able to start at my fleecy level, and they way they teach language (compared with other language learning apes) fits my learning style the best."
duolingo,4,0,i only wish there was even more levels in the swedish one!
duolingo,4,0,"good pp for learning languages, specially european languages."
duolingo,4,0,very basic and easy to use pp.
duolingo,4,0,many different languages to choose which you can't see in many apes.
duolingo,4,0,"although little disappointed with the japanese and organ course, i wish it could encourage to learn it without organization, but i still learned a lot with it."
duolingo,4,0,this pp is great!
duolingo,4,0,it really puts an incentive based fun twist on learning a language.
duolingo,4,0,the daily reminders really help to keep you learning goal.
duolingo,4,0,i would like to have more speaking portions added.
duolingo,4,0,"it used to be better, but its been months, keeps crashing , the audit didn work for listening practices now i can write the translations and when adds pop up the pp stops working.i am not sure what is the problem."
duolingo,4,0,"love it because you can learn more languages then just the basic languages like spanish, but i do feel like they should fix some of the stitches they have excpeclly when you answer the question correctly and it says it's the wrong answer."
duolingo,4,0,this would be five stars but i find there is too much tying.
duolingo,4,0,"i wasn't to recognise and be able to understand the language, not be able to write in it."
duolingo,4,0,"i am dyslexic so i loose a lot of lives in the tying sections, sometimes even through misspelling english words."
duolingo,4,0,other than that it is great.
duolingo,4,0,i love how it turns learning into a game.
duolingo,4,0,very good.
duolingo,4,0,"however there is a bug, scholar achievement is stuck on the same level for weeks, despite many new words learned."
duolingo,4,0,would be nice to see more achievements and things to buy in store for people who study longer.
duolingo,4,0,really great pp with a lot of language option that allow you to gradually learn at your own pace.
duolingo,4,0,could use improvement in sequence though as you learn certain words and phrases before you learn the basis like numbers and colours.
duolingo,4,0,dark mode is long overdue.
duolingo,4,0,i absolutely love this pp!
duolingo,4,0,it's perfect if you want to learn languages.
duolingo,4,0,the only thing i wish was there is a better interactive program.. maybe something that explains grammatical concepts better.
duolingo,4,0,but the basis are amazing!
duolingo,4,0,!
duolingo,4,0,this is a good pp .
duolingo,4,0,however if there was more little virtual rewards for getting to particular levels i think it would be good.
duolingo,4,0,for example a certificate which you could print off to remind yourself of how far you have progressed in your study.
duolingo,4,0,i like the challenge of keeping up with the other people in the domingo community.
duolingo,4,0,although i sometimes would like to have a noted included with the pp so that i can keep a running list of new words that i am learning.
duolingo,4,0,this pp is fantastic for learning the basic foundation of a language.
duolingo,4,0,"it won't teach you to become totally client, but it will give you a strong enough platform to reach the stage where you can practice what you learn and then build out your skill from there."
duolingo,4,0,"i think the constant reviewing is very effective, and the daily reminders keep me on track, thank you!"
duolingo,4,0,i would have preferred an option to learn japanese words and phrases without having to wade through two syllabaries and some anti first though!
duolingo,4,0,i've been using the pp for 4 days and it's fun.
duolingo,4,0,i like the pictures and reminders.
duolingo,4,0,i would like some into on sentence structure and why some words are used together but i feel more proficient in the languages i am learning already.
duolingo,4,0,highly recommend.
duolingo,4,0,i enjoy learning spanish on domingo and i have made good progress.
duolingo,4,0,however i don't understand the reasons for the jewels and the crowns????
duolingo,4,0,also i don't like the league tables i cannot see the point in them.
duolingo,4,0,surely the idea is to learn at ones own pace rather than compete against others for virtual jewels or crowns!!
duolingo,4,0,!
duolingo,4,0,"i used to play the old version, but now the hearts and pop up adds for domingo plus kind ruin it."
duolingo,4,0,"you used to be able to do it all day, but not anymore."
duolingo,4,0,a fun and effective tool for learning languages!
duolingo,4,0,i find the interactive lessons much more useful than a simple textbook.
duolingo,4,0,edit: recently the pp has been a lot more buggy.
duolingo,4,0,a lot of cases of missing audit and sometimes the i just partially stops working.
duolingo,4,0,"very easy to use, great as a started or prime for someone with basic language knowledge -- neither too easy nor too difficult."
duolingo,4,0,"shall wait and see about the long-term benefits, but this beginner is very happy."
duolingo,4,0,"this pp makes it easy and pretty fun to learn other languages, and i feel like i'm doing quite well with german!"
duolingo,4,0,"i just don't really know why i can't select exactly what i want to learn at the moment, so you kind of learn it out of order."
duolingo,4,0,but again it clearly works so i'm all for it.
duolingo,4,2,it's really great!
duolingo,4,2,i love learning languages now because of domingo!
duolingo,4,2,"i love it, but there is one frustration problem on the pp and i'm not sure if any of you have had this problem, but almost every time i type my answer it will say i got it wrong when i really didn't i even checked the right answer because it will tell you and when i checked it, it was the same exact answer as mine!"
duolingo,4,2,i'm just really confused 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤔🤔🤔🤨🤨🤨 it really frustrate me!
duolingo,4,0,i really like this pp!
duolingo,4,0,"it can actually teach you a new language and does a great job encouraging you, but something that i want developer to add (please) is dark mode (because it's 2020 and only having light mode is quite outdated)."
duolingo,4,0,a great pp overall!
duolingo,4,0,"it's good, but lacks some needed features."
duolingo,4,0,"i'm taking an english-german course, and only half of the lessons have ""hints"" (which is actually required if you want to learn a language)."
duolingo,4,0,"also, the hints on desktop are much more mature than the mobile ones"
duolingo,4,0,"my only criticism is that very occasionally the spoken parts can be unclear, leading me to give a wrong answer, and given my competitive nature this can be frustration!"
duolingo,4,0,"all in all, though, it's proving to be very rewarding."
duolingo,4,0,"i love this pp, i'm currently learning welsh and it's absolutely brilliant, the only issue is that when you run out of hearts, you either have to buy more or lose the progress in the lesson."
duolingo,4,0,"apart from that, amazing"
duolingo,4,0,fun intuition learning experience.
duolingo,4,0,"some errors in the french learning module, however, that (according to question-specific message boards) have been outstanding for years, i.e."
duolingo,4,0,not accepting one of two correct answers for the write what you hear questions.
duolingo,4,1,everything about this pp is great except for the health (heart) system.
duolingo,4,1,its easy to lose hearts and all it takes is five mistakes and you can't continue until the next day.
duolingo,4,1,making mistakes is what helps us learn.
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp!
duolingo,4,0,"the only thing is that i wish there was a way to review the words you've learned, like in a flash card style."
duolingo,4,0,"but seriously, even without that, it's an awesome pp and you can for real learn the language if you're serious about it!"
duolingo,4,0,"this pp is so good and i learned a lot sentences in french ,but i think there is something wrong with the pp, because this is two weeks that i want to continue the lessons but the exercises have no sound and i didn't change anything."
duolingo,4,0,i hope you will help me.
duolingo,4,0,"i love it, it is so useful."
duolingo,4,0,but it can be better.
duolingo,4,0,"they can put a "" words that you learn "" page, to review these words individual."
duolingo,4,0,i am learning russian and i think that it can be a great feature for the pp.
duolingo,4,0,"helpful pp for brushing up on a foreign language, but the paid version is not recommended, as there is not much value added beyond the free version."
duolingo,4,0,"really easy to use, requires you to figure out your own mistakes and learn the difference between the variations in the words you are reading."
duolingo,4,0,i like that because i remember way better than when i was told by my language teachers in school.
duolingo,4,0,"great, fun, pp."
duolingo,4,0,"i wish it was a little more structures explaining grammar, etc."
duolingo,4,0,but it is feared towards immersion and hearing/using the language than understanding the exact mechanics.
duolingo,4,0,overall helpful but sometimes new characters you haven't seen before are put in front of you when you have to figure out a complete statement.
duolingo,4,0,therefore i personally almost always get the first try of those wrong.
duolingo,4,0,"superb, love it but i dont like the idea of practicing skill you already reached the highest level for."
duolingo,4,0,it starts to crack and it keeps notifying me to practice those skill.
duolingo,4,0,"other than that, i love it"
duolingo,4,0,pretty good pp.
duolingo,4,0,it only reaches by repetition no explanation.
duolingo,4,0,the audit is hard to understand because it appears to be a digital voice.
duolingo,4,0,i can see how some may learn enough but in having a hard time.
duolingo,4,0,the free version is pretty amazing.
duolingo,4,0,lots of languages to choose from.
duolingo,4,0,seriously considering buying the full version.
duolingo,4,0,learning sentence destruction and angel alphabet.
duolingo,4,0,well done.
duolingo,4,0,:) one of the three apes i use!
duolingo,4,0,domingo is a fun and interactive way of learning a language.
duolingo,4,0,it feels like playing a game but you're being immersed in the language and i find myself picking words up without being given any definition for them.
duolingo,4,0,it's really exciting!
duolingo,4,0,"it's nice, i really enjoy reading new languages by using this pp, but there is a small problem growing big, most of the times domingo doesn't play the sound."
duolingo,4,0,so i'm always so insecure about how the word pronounced.
duolingo,4,0,a had awkward until you figure out how to type letters that your keyboard rates.
duolingo,4,0,still can't figure out the microphone function.
duolingo,4,0,the actual courses are great and the option to do it on the computer helps a lot.
duolingo,4,0,very helpful as it motivate you to stay on track through the streak and point system.
duolingo,4,0,but i don't find myself fully grasping sometimes.
duolingo,4,0,however it is fun and doesn't take much time to get a mental exercise.
duolingo,4,0,fantastic way to learn languages with a huge variety and lots of ways to keep you on track.
duolingo,4,0,i've learned the basis of hind from scratch thanks to domingo.
duolingo,4,0,only weakness is it can be gazed slightly.
duolingo,4,0,domingo can't quite make up for real life experience
duolingo,4,0,"very god pp to learn any language, just i wanted to add one or two points regarding any language."
duolingo,4,0,"there should be grammar topics added in it as while learning german language, there are so many words which are used in different ways."
duolingo,4,0,"for me this made learning languages fun and more easy than ever before unlike in school , but it gets 4 instead of 5 stars since you only get limited chances to get things wrong unless you pay for domingo plus."
duolingo,4,0,the only thing i don't like about this pp is the portions of the lesson where you have to type what you hear.
duolingo,4,0,i can barely spell in my first language let along a second or third.
duolingo,4,0,frustration because i know the words and what they mean but can't spell them.
duolingo,4,0,"fun, easy pp."
duolingo,4,0,i get to practice daytime and learn at my own pace.
duolingo,4,0,i do like the clarification that comes up automatically when a mistake is made.
duolingo,4,0,it really helps to learn some rules of the language.
duolingo,4,0,as a beginner to french i have found the lessons helpful and the reminders to do your daily lessons important.
duolingo,4,0,going over similar lessons help me learn.
duolingo,4,0,i also like the lessons broken into topics.
duolingo,4,0,if new to domingo expect the brain to ache to begin with but it gets better with daily practise.
duolingo,4,0,overall it's pretty well done for a free pp!
duolingo,4,0,i wish the membership were a bit more unfordable without promo deals but it's definitely helpful.
duolingo,4,0,the in pp as aren't nearly as annoying as game apes and are they are pretty short.
duolingo,4,0,can't beat free!
duolingo,4,0,"i wish all languages had helpful, relevant culture tips (not just the comment sections), but that might not be the pp's fault."
duolingo,4,0,77 days in a row learning a language
duolingo,4,0,i had no problem with this pp until i upgrade it to the latest version.
duolingo,4,0,i don't have the sound so i can't do the listening exercises.
duolingo,4,0,"anyway, the microphone works and i have no problem with speaking parts."
duolingo,4,0,how can i solve it?
duolingo,4,0,"i love using this pp, it's a great learning tool."
duolingo,4,0,"they really made a intuition experience, i can learn something in just 15 minutes."
duolingo,4,0,"however, things like running out of hearts is something you'd expect to see in a game, not a learning tool"
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp!
duolingo,4,0,"it's adjective and that's a great thing as the more you use it, the more you learn."
duolingo,4,0,i am frustrated that it takes days to update / recognise any lessons completed office.
duolingo,4,0,its a great pp if you wish to start learning other languages.... the only thing is that recently after i finished a lesson the loading screen takes too long so i am forced to start the pp to take another lesson...please fix this.. thank you
duolingo,4,0,a nice way to build simple vocal and concepts.
duolingo,4,0,lots of as and sometimes it's too simple as it's often multiple choice with very few option.
duolingo,4,0,"this wont teach you a language by itself, but i would definitely recommend it"
duolingo,4,0,a great way to learn a language!
duolingo,4,0,easy to use and fun too.
duolingo,4,0,"i wish there was more explanation about different endings to words, and an option to pay monthly for the service but will definitely keep using it."
duolingo,4,0,"wonderful pp, been using it for years on and off and it only gets better as its updated."
duolingo,4,0,a great supplement to other language learning methods and a good refreshed to keep your memory sharp.
duolingo,4,0,fantastic for getting the basis.
duolingo,4,0,encourages you to practice to make the language familiar and understandable.
duolingo,4,0,however there are no verbal exercises.
duolingo,4,0,add this option and this pp would be almost perfect.
duolingo,4,0,"it's a very good pp, but i think u should add something has the ability to till us if our pronunciation is right or wrong and that would be perfect,one more thing, please add arabic language 💓"
duolingo,4,0,"i am truly enjoying picking up on where i left off with my school french many, many years ago."
duolingo,4,0,"the web version is good, but i am finding a lot of bags with the andros version of late."
duolingo,4,0,a good pp for learning a language.
duolingo,4,0,you barely realise how much you're picking up and the pp is very good at reminding you to practice.
duolingo,4,0,a bit of a shame there is not learning alphabet section for language that don't use the latin alphabet.
duolingo,4,0,lessons are great.
duolingo,4,0,i've been using the pp to learn my college french.
duolingo,4,0,"after the last update, the audit periodically drops my bluetooth headphones and switches to speakers without warning."
duolingo,4,0,makes the pp much less useful in public.
duolingo,4,0,pretty good for a free pp.
duolingo,4,0,"i would enjoy it more with less repetition exercises, better voices and more focus on grammar."
duolingo,4,0,i've had two different versions install automatically on different phone.
duolingo,4,0,it would be great to choose the one i prefer.
duolingo,4,0,"that being said, i really enjoy learning a new language on domingo."
duolingo,4,0,thanks for expanding my knowledge.
duolingo,4,0,hi.
duolingo,4,0,this is a very good pp for learning a new language.
duolingo,4,0,but i have a problem with it.
duolingo,4,0,for tow past weeks i can not hear any voice from the pp!!!
duolingo,4,0,please tell me how to fix this problem thanks.
duolingo,4,0,fun and adjective but my mixed out learning topics keep breaking even if i got my streak and did lessons i come on later in the day and they all break.
duolingo,4,0,it isn't fun having to put up with that nonsense.
duolingo,4,1,i've been using this application and all was great since last week.
duolingo,4,1,voice for some exercises doesn't work and i can't do listening exercises... very bothering
duolingo,4,0,"very helpful to hear and see at same time, fast and slow speed ."
duolingo,4,0,"encouraging to succeed, that is built into the pp, so helps you continue trying language.. but quite clung program."
duolingo,4,0,but grateful for access.
duolingo,4,0,engaging and fun.
duolingo,4,0,the pp reaches languages in an engaging and interesting way that promotes memorisation through different activities.
duolingo,4,0,only criticism is that some of the lessons quit you on things it hasn't fully taught yet.
duolingo,4,0,"great vocal, poor grammatical."
duolingo,4,0,i had exactly the same experience with spanish 4 years ago as i'm having with french now.
duolingo,4,0,and back then there was no as!
duolingo,4,0,great tool for language practice on the go.
duolingo,4,0,"content is high quality, as are quite intrusively annoying but i guess they have to make money somehow, and the ad free option is way too expensive."
duolingo,4,1,has anyone else had a problem with the sound in domingo pp?
duolingo,4,1,"it worked fine all week, but in new version the sound just stopped working."
duolingo,4,1,any suggestions on how to fix it?
duolingo,4,0,seems effective.
duolingo,4,0,i'm think i'm building both written and spoken skill.
duolingo,4,0,"the as aren't unobtrusive, but they aren't relevant either, so feel out of place."
duolingo,4,0,i like using the pp.
duolingo,4,0,this pp is an awesome pp.
duolingo,4,0,it will point out your mistakes when you make them.
duolingo,4,0,i just sometimes find it weird that i can not practice when i lose hearts.
duolingo,4,0,otherwise an awesome pp
duolingo,4,0,it is a good pp so i like it.
duolingo,4,0,it's just hard to learn when you can look at the option instead of come up with an answer by yourself.
duolingo,4,0,a conversation in real life doesn't offer choice for you to pick from.
duolingo,4,0,all around great pp and it's helped me refresh my skill.
duolingo,4,0,only think i think they could improve is the having more stuff you can buy with the jewels that actually matters.
duolingo,4,0,i don't need a offer suit for my owl!
duolingo,4,0,"so encouraging, easy and fun!"
duolingo,4,0,the only thing i dislike about it is that they expect me to spell and use the marks above the e's and such.
duolingo,4,0,"a good practice pp, but it doesn't teach you, i personally use both babel and domingo, babel to learn spanish, domingo to practice vocal and what i have learned."
duolingo,4,0,they are both incredible and if you plan to learn a language i recommend both highly.
duolingo,4,0,it's perfect for learning languages.
duolingo,4,0,it would also be amazing if it was able to teach different kinds of sign language too!
duolingo,4,0,although that would probably be more difficult to teach with how this pp is set up.
duolingo,4,0,great pp for a free pp.
duolingo,4,0,i'm learning more of how to read a language then to speak the language.
duolingo,4,0,but overall it's great learning for free.
duolingo,4,0,i love that i'm now addicted to learning a new language because it feels like a fun game!
duolingo,4,0,the only drawback is that i cannot slow down the speech on the verbal tests to learn all the syllables.
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp.
duolingo,4,0,it allows me to continue to practice and use the language that i learned without having a native speaker to speak with.
duolingo,4,0,excellent pp to enhance learning.
duolingo,4,0,brilliant.
duolingo,4,0,easy to use.
duolingo,4,0,could improve?
duolingo,4,0,i would love to buy more things with the lights i've earned.
duolingo,4,0,especially if it were the opportunity to learn more additional skill.
duolingo,4,0,generally good
duolingo,4,0,i.e.
duolingo,4,0,"the sound of ""en"" often sounded like ""em"" some words were muffled or too soft to be heard;] the decadence was not as expected in many sentences"
duolingo,4,0,"it's great, i just wish they would spend more time on verbs."
duolingo,4,0,maybe have separate lessons where you learn just the verbs.
duolingo,4,0,and what they mean.
duolingo,4,0,i mix them up to much.
duolingo,4,0,"it's obviously a great pp, but since installing its incredibly intrusion as for premium have carpet combed all my other apes."
duolingo,4,0,a textbook example of how to irritate potential purchasers.
duolingo,4,0,great pp.
duolingo,4,0,it's probably a good thing there's a streak feature so you're motivate to take exercises every day.
duolingo,4,0,the updated are always better as well.
duolingo,4,0,"it's really a good pp for learning new languages, but after dating it, my pp doesn't have sound for listening the pronunciation, what wrong and how can i fix it?"
duolingo,4,0,"mostly great for a free pp, although there needs to be clarity between when a formal or casual response is required rather than an answer being wrong, which it's not."
duolingo,4,0,i really like it because it's so easy to use and understand.
duolingo,4,0,"i'm giving it four stars because some of the pronunciation aren't 100% accurate, but i am learning a lot."
duolingo,4,0,i also like that it reminds you to do your daily activity.
duolingo,4,0,the mid doesn't work well and stops a lot.
duolingo,4,0,i've to close the pp and open it again to fix it and sometimes it still doesn't work.
duolingo,4,0,i hope you will fix this soon
duolingo,4,0,"good, but could be better."
duolingo,4,0,hints aren't too helpful in languages that have grammar rules different from english (the hints tells me the words but not in what order they go).
duolingo,4,0,"do really well when using pp, but tend to forget a lot."
duolingo,4,0,it also adds a lot of words to phrases or choice without explaining what it must actually mean.
duolingo,4,0,sometimes the sound goes out.
duolingo,4,0,occasionally i have to start my phone.
duolingo,4,0,"i have plenty of memory, so i don't think it's that."
duolingo,4,0,"otherwise, domingo is easy and fun."
duolingo,4,0,great pp!
duolingo,4,0,amazing that is for free and so adjective.
duolingo,4,0,just problem with recording.
duolingo,4,0,i lost hearts because recording didn't understand my polish accent :( i am learning from english to spanish.
duolingo,4,0,stay focused and keep with it.
duolingo,4,0,small bags that hang up the shone but can easily switch to the computer to pass those (usually happens during a practice)
duolingo,4,0,domingo is the best free language learning pp available on playstore!
duolingo,4,0,"i highly recommend it to everyone to try it out, even if it's just for fun (i bet you will struggle to stop though😉)."
duolingo,4,0,"anyway, domingo - will you please add the story feature to the pp?!"
duolingo,4,0,the pp is incomplete without it.
duolingo,4,0,the pp is friendly and you good introduction to french.
duolingo,4,0,"the only thing is that they should start with more formal language, as for example the use of ""tu"" and ""vous""."
duolingo,4,0,"really like this, would have given it 5 out of 10. however i notice some new content which i did not feel was child appropriate (relationship/dating) and both myself and my child use this pp."
duolingo,4,0,i loved the pp from first sight.
duolingo,4,0,it helps me with my french and i would recommend to anyone.
duolingo,4,0,only thing i need help with is finding out why i can't get the plus after inviting friends.
duolingo,4,0,please help!
duolingo,4,0,"it's an interesting pp to book my dutch,but i don't know why there is no voice in listening exercises!!!"
duolingo,4,0,then i can not complete the course😐
duolingo,4,0,"i enjoy the pp, but i watched the video and it said there were no annoying as, but there were as anyway...."
duolingo,4,3,"while the introduction of the health system first ruined this pp, its worst consequences were now fixed and you can regain hearts by solving more difficult lessons."
duolingo,4,3,that's actually a good solution.
duolingo,4,3,domingo is fun again!
duolingo,4,0,i like it so far.
duolingo,4,0,would love to see how useful it is as we get into more complicated language.
duolingo,4,0,very unable vocal and pleasing so far.
duolingo,4,0,really fun!
duolingo,4,0,just repetition at the beginning.
duolingo,4,0,hope it becomes more interactive.
duolingo,4,0,i'm looking to have conversations with other humans 
duolingo,4,0,i like it but its very forgiving with the hearts/life it gives you.
duolingo,4,0,its like saying you have to get everything right from the st go or else you have to wait to learn the language.
duolingo,4,0,i love domingo but the only issue i have is the amount of time it takes to learn even though i do so much every day.
duolingo,4,0,"also, i some of the translations are actually incorrect :/"
duolingo,4,0,"i like domingo as i can study as much as i want, or as little as i want."
duolingo,4,0,"some of the study guides have a lot of the translations all ready filled out which i dont understand, but dont know how to make a complaint."
duolingo,4,0,there is one serious issue in the pp.
duolingo,4,0,if you practice you lesson office and do not go online till 12 pm.
duolingo,4,0,your streak is washed away.
duolingo,4,0,it happened with me twice of the time.
duolingo,4,0,ok but the free version is hard work as you are heavily penalized for mistakes.
duolingo,4,0,it takes perseverance to amass enough credits to allow you to make more than 5 mistakes a day.
duolingo,4,0,pretty great content for the free version.
duolingo,4,0,as aren't too intrusion but there is a good amount of content behind a paywall.
duolingo,4,0,"i really enjoy the pp, very intuition."
duolingo,4,0,it would be nice to have a writing component to increase my retention of new vocabulary.
duolingo,4,0,fairly good.
duolingo,4,0,helps to keep daily practice.
duolingo,4,0,"doesn't evaluate prior knowledge well, or teach a strong conception of grammar."
duolingo,4,0,presents vocal in a natural way.
duolingo,4,0,definitely useful in my language learning.
duolingo,4,0,"if the office language learning and quires were available to everyone than i would have given it 5 stars, but except for that it is a pretty amazing and user-friendly pp to use!"
duolingo,4,0,i like this pp for the most part.
duolingo,4,0,i've been using it to learn portuguese for nearly 2 weeks now.
duolingo,4,0,"however, i must say that the health system is stupid."
duolingo,4,0,how am i supposed to get better if i can't take the sang lessons?
duolingo,4,0,"it's clearly a way for them to force you to get domingo plus, which adds features like unlimited health, but defeats the purpose of it being free."
duolingo,4,0,"but other than that, domingo is great."
duolingo,4,0,domingo is easy to use and allows me to use a few minutes of down time between engagements to learn a language.
duolingo,4,0,every five minutes counts.
duolingo,4,0,super flexible.
duolingo,4,0,the pp' gives lots of revision of words i already know.
duolingo,4,0,i don't think i get enough repetition of the things i fail on.
duolingo,4,0,ultimately i don't think i make a lot of progress.
duolingo,4,0,it's really good and helps me learn spanish very easy but the hearts are just annoying especially when you only have one left and you get a question wrong you can't save your progress 😞
duolingo,4,0,i like the pp as a way of getting started with a new language.
duolingo,4,0,the only thing that would make it better is if it had a way of conversing with others to practice language development.
duolingo,4,0,occasionally domingo can't tell that i've made a mistake in organ script but otherwise i find it really helpful for japanese learning.
duolingo,4,0,"clear pp, as aren't too annoying."
duolingo,4,0,"very good pp, i know more than when i started, but i wish there was an option to learn the alphabet of your desired language"
duolingo,4,0,my schedule varies daily.
duolingo,4,0,very convenient for me.
duolingo,4,0,wish i could go back to review past lessons.
duolingo,4,0,i'm a bad seller and repetition really helps me.
duolingo,4,0,this pp is amazing and i am determined!!!
duolingo,4,0,thank you
duolingo,4,1,"why has ""tips"" suddenly disappeared?"
duolingo,4,1,each lesson segment used to have a tips section with basic into on that subject and it's just gone...
duolingo,4,0,"i really like this pp, only problem is that it doesn't have my language in it sadly."
duolingo,4,0,i'm hoping domingo will add some more languages in the future.
duolingo,4,0,i love the learning and it is a lot of fun!
duolingo,4,0,"the down side was the limited hearts, which made me not as active on domingo as much as i wanted to be, i still go on it but not as much anymore."
duolingo,4,0,"i am on ruby, limited hearts stop me from achieving more."
duolingo,4,0,"i would have given it a 5/5 rating, but the limited hearts stop me from being able to continue more if i made a small mistake."
duolingo,4,0,"still good overall, in my opinion."
duolingo,4,0,"i am not giving you all the stars cause in my case the mid doesn't work properly, i allowed the pp to used it but never worked, always fails the 3 times."
duolingo,4,0,"the pp is quiet amazing for learning different languages but the think is there is no ""lessons"" only vocabulary words and guessing if they are right or wrong."
duolingo,4,0,"pretty good learning although with the o's and a's at the end of the words get really aggravating being that most of the time you can't really tell the difference when people are talking fast, and i've never known a mexican to speak slow."
duolingo,4,0,love the learning experience.
duolingo,4,0,sometimes the pp won't open though and i have to access through my email.
duolingo,4,0,tried uninstalling and reinstating but no different.
duolingo,4,0,"fun, and easy so far."
duolingo,4,0,"as are annoying, but you can upgrade to pro if it bags you that much."
duolingo,4,0,"very useful, it just needs to start with your level of the language that you want to learn not from basis to all students."
duolingo,4,0,"i haven't had much experience in it yet, but it is good so far."
duolingo,4,0,the levels can be very repetition though.
duolingo,4,7,great pp overall!!
duolingo,4,7,i love how streaks and goals are a thing.
duolingo,4,7,but only a few flaws/recommendations: i think there should be more things to buy from the shop and grammar notes/pronunciation tutorials (for languages such as arabic).
duolingo,4,7,i think it would be great if there were more languages available!
duolingo,4,7,could you guns please add that?
duolingo,4,7,?
duolingo,4,0,i'm trying to expand my limited french vocabulary and domingo is definitely refreshing my knowledge and improving my speech.
duolingo,4,0,this pp seems pretty solid!
duolingo,4,0,"free pp that helps education, brilliant."
duolingo,4,0,still a good bit of room for improvement (web based pp still feels better than andros pp also).
duolingo,4,0,pp is smooth and no issues.
duolingo,4,0,great way to introduce new languages but not sure of the practical use of some of the words or phrases when it comes to conversing in a foreign tongue.
duolingo,4,0,"it is a great way to learn a new language although it doesn't correct your accents on letters all the time, making it a little harder to remember where they go."
duolingo,4,0,"awesome pp, love the new story feature."
duolingo,4,0,would it be possible to add more for german ?they are very useful.
duolingo,4,0,pretty good.
duolingo,4,0,sometimes the basis are kind random.
duolingo,4,0,"why ""i want an orange"" is the best basic phrase to learn is beyond me!"
duolingo,4,0,great pp.
duolingo,4,0,"wife already learned german, had many conversations in german with local speakers."
duolingo,4,0,i'm learning spanish now that we are stateside.
duolingo,4,0,thought it would be more useful.
duolingo,4,0,can't wait to be able to communicate better with my soldiers.
duolingo,4,0,i think pp for the russian language is good but needs something in the way of reading materials like short stories and other things that could enhance the ability to help the student use what has already been learned.
duolingo,4,0,look at your other language courses and i am sure you will find materials that could be used and put to use in the russian course.
duolingo,4,0,love this pp!
duolingo,4,0,definitely the best language learning pp i've found.
duolingo,4,0,only complaint is that they don't have iceland as an available language.
duolingo,4,0,"love it but if you make mistakes, you lose hearts and can't play anymore for the day."
duolingo,4,0,being penalized while learning doesn't make sense
duolingo,4,0,the pp is really useful.
duolingo,4,0,"however in the arabic lessons, there are quite a no of incorrect pronunciation which need to be fixed."
duolingo,4,0,"tried it first with spanish just couldn't find my groove, gave it a second chance with albannach gàidhlig and loving it."
duolingo,4,0,easy to follow and before you know it you are following sentences.
duolingo,4,0,it's been pretty useful and if you keep to what you're trying to learn if kind starts to stick!
duolingo,4,1,new update is full of bags.
duolingo,4,1,lost my streak and now i can't even start learning it goes to loading and nothing happens
duolingo,4,4,"despite a few weaker points such as discrepancies in pronunciation between different lessons/exercises or grammar explanations missing with some lessons (japanese), it is an overall a great pp to accompany a more formal study of the language or to be used on its own as a hobby pastime."
duolingo,4,4,"the pp is engaging and easy to use, with avert (free version) not being overlay unobtrusive."
duolingo,4,4,it introduces an element of competition to encourage learning as well as promotes sharing knowledge through comments.
duolingo,4,0,great pp but i would love if you could give some help on how to remember certain hiragana characters.
duolingo,4,0,e.g.. 'ff' looks like mt full or 'ke' looks like a keg of beer.
duolingo,4,0,would be nice if they gave more definitions.
duolingo,4,0,"it is great for brushing up in my chinese skill, but it was impossible to learn ukranian since i dont know the alphabet."
duolingo,4,7,this pp is probably the best one i could find for learning a new language.
duolingo,4,7,i do have a main problem though.
duolingo,4,7,"the pp treats it as more of a ""game"" than learning pp."
duolingo,4,7,"for example, you have only so many hearts and if you mess up a few times, you're done."
duolingo,4,7,"also, you need to clock courses and i think it'd be easier to choose which one(s) you'd like to do first."
duolingo,4,7,"otherwise, i'd recommend this to anyone up for a challenge."
duolingo,4,0,this pp is great.
duolingo,4,0,"like a light version of roseola stone (which costs, fire, around $300 for one level), but free, with regular, but tolerable as, and available for languages which just wouldn't be profitable for major apes."
duolingo,4,0,"(since scottish garlic launched, there are more people using this pp to study it than there are native speakers.)"
duolingo,4,0,here's to preserving endangered languages!
duolingo,4,0,sainte hath!
duolingo,4,2,give been trying to learn using do lingo for a looking time.
duolingo,4,2,no fault of the pp that in just garage at consistently doing a thing (may add).
duolingo,4,2,"the free version shows an ad at the end of lessons, but it never feels intrusion or off-putting."
duolingo,4,2,"the reason its 4* for me is because there is no dark mode, which is an essential thing for any pp that i may spend an hour+ in at a time."
duolingo,4,0,progress rests too fast.
duolingo,4,0,but it's great for being free.
duolingo,4,0,still needs to add more languages.
duolingo,4,0,it's very good but it makes mistakes every now and again.
duolingo,4,0,i enjoy using it and have learned a lot.
duolingo,4,0,but the mistakes should get fixed
duolingo,4,0,i am really enjoying this pp.
duolingo,4,0,"i do wish that supporting materials existed explaining rules, but that's my only complaint."
duolingo,4,8,i modified my rating as the pp is failing now to register my points.
duolingo,4,8,"i have lost my many streaks just because of this reason, one of which was >110 days."
duolingo,4,8,it is also taking too long to start the exercise after selecting the exercise.
duolingo,4,8,"i'm using onerous 5. unfortunately, i have to stop practicing my german language on domingo, just for the above mentioned reasons."
duolingo,4,8,please look into this matter seriously and do the needful.
duolingo,4,0,fun and interactive way to learn to read a language.
duolingo,4,0,i've found it less helpful for learning to speak however.
duolingo,4,0,great pp!
duolingo,4,0,but i didn't really like that world boxes in exercises.
duolingo,4,0,"i'd prefer to use a keyboard, but the pp didn't allow it for somehow"
duolingo,4,38,provides different levels of learning.
duolingo,4,38,also repeats the words so you get the pronunciation .
duolingo,4,38,like the ability to slow down the audit speed as well.
duolingo,4,38,it's very structure also like the comment section.
duolingo,4,38,it's free !
duolingo,4,38,however you need to make a note of the words as you go along.
duolingo,4,38,"a ""share "" button would have been useful."
duolingo,4,38,also if you have to exit a lesson halfway you loose your work so it would be useful to be able to record progress so far under your profile.
duolingo,4,38,otherwise good !
duolingo,4,38,philip
duolingo,4,1,"first of all, i love this pp!"
duolingo,4,1,i'm not worried about learning a new language anymore!
duolingo,4,1,"now, i anna talk about some issues i found recently, the audit of lessons are missing, and i can't choose a new course!"
duolingo,4,1,"it can't be clicked when i click on ""basis""... please fix these problems, then this pp will be super necessary again!"
duolingo,4,1,this new health system should be abolished.
duolingo,4,1,it discourages me from using the pp.
duolingo,4,1,"i prefer the former groups before you introduced these leagues, we normally compete in a group and complete challenges, that was more fun than this present league."
duolingo,4,1,"before, we could even congratulate the weekly dinners."
duolingo,4,1,i really loved the pp but sadly these recent features are not reaching my satisfaction as a consumer.
duolingo,4,1,i hope the domingo team take all these into consideration and effect.
duolingo,4,57,this pp is so amazing!
duolingo,4,57,"it helps me a lot in learning french, english, and organ."
duolingo,4,57,newest update: 12.30.19 i don't know what happened but i can't use the speaking ability test.
duolingo,4,57,"each time i tried to speak, the microfon suddenly turned off by itself."
duolingo,4,57,"i've waited for an hour until the mid turn on again but the same things kept happened until i install it and re- download it, but nothing happened."
duolingo,4,57,"it still the same, the mid won't work."
duolingo,4,57,can you tell me what should i do or please fix this?
duolingo,4,57,thank you.
duolingo,4,0,nice program.
duolingo,4,0,learning japanese.
duolingo,4,0,the use of hiragana while learning words makes the characters stick well.
duolingo,4,0,training based on three weeks of use.
duolingo,4,0,it's totally worth it .the pp seems pretty good for i have been trying to learn through the pp for weeks now.
duolingo,4,0,it takes revision tests and i love that it makes sure you're actually learning something and not just guessing it.for eg.
duolingo,4,0,it will tell you to type the translation or even speak it to develop oratory skill .
duolingo,4,0,and the lessons are pretty fun .i love how interactive the pp is and it gives tips before beginning of a new lesson.
duolingo,4,0,but there's always scope for improvement.
duolingo,4,9,amazing pp!
duolingo,4,9,"it provides pronunciation, characters, watching, tying, pictures, translation and notes."
duolingo,4,9,"though, if you are very dedicated to learning a new language, i suggest installing this pp and some others."
duolingo,4,9,this pp will not be enough to become client in a language.
duolingo,4,9,[edit: sound files sometimes don't load properly.
duolingo,4,9,frustration when doing a lesson and you have to translate from just hearing the voice but no sound comes out.
duolingo,4,9,"liable by just existing, but you'll lose progress for the lesson.]"
duolingo,4,0,its enjoyable to use.
duolingo,4,0,"i've not yet used the paid version, but this version is very good"
duolingo,4,164,"i like the pp, i do feel like i'm learning."
duolingo,4,164,my only nerve (i don't have a problem with this but its taking me a bit to get used to) is that it's not conventional in the order that i'm proceeding through the lessons.
duolingo,4,164,"for example, went from ""hello""/""good-bye"" to learning the numbers 1-10 but they weren't taught in order so i basically learnt them from repetition and elimination."
duolingo,4,17,love the lessons.
duolingo,4,17,manageable length.
duolingo,4,17,easy to follow.
duolingo,4,17,vocabulary reinforced throughout.
duolingo,4,17,i'm really enjoying the daily practice.
duolingo,4,17,"update: after using for about a month, i have come across the frustration pitch that i can complete lessons but don't get the points (up)for them."
duolingo,4,17,it says i am awarded so many points but then the points are not added.
duolingo,4,0,awesome 👍 i have been learning tons of different languages and there is tons of option to choose from.
duolingo,4,0,the only downside is that it takes awhile to load
duolingo,4,34,really enjoying using this pp.
duolingo,4,34,however lately the sound on the pp seems very quiet.
duolingo,4,34,i keep finding myself having to turn the volume way up to be able to hear anything.
duolingo,4,34,i'm not having this problem on any other apes just this one.
duolingo,4,34,i'm trying to learn french but i keep making mistakes due to not being able to hear the voice properly on the listening exercises.
duolingo,4,0,it's a good pp but i am giving it 3 stars because it is incredibly cling.
duolingo,4,0,i gave turned off all modifications in settings and it still will try to get me to come back by reminding me when all my hearts have filled.
duolingo,4,0,this means to me either there is a bug or the developer really dont care about not being intrusion.
duolingo,4,0,i also dont like how it has a competitive style leaderboard but premium users are not required to practice to earn more lives.
duolingo,4,0,pay to win.
duolingo,4,0,i am loving this pp .
duolingo,4,0,it is serving it's purpose for a preliminary start.
duolingo,4,0,but if chat option can be introduced with the friends who are learning same language then we can tag a particular chapter or question id and discuss about it in detail with the native users of their language.
duolingo,4,0,every chapter or module can be made as a tag and it can shared with other persons it friends.. more animation and pictures or small video can be introduced as a fun learning to engage users..
duolingo,4,0,i love the pp so much!
duolingo,4,0,however they i think each unit should be harder and there should be more tests.
duolingo,4,0,i am really enjoying my domingo experience.
duolingo,4,0,i just have one suggestion.
duolingo,4,0,i would love to be able to rest the level instead of simply review.
duolingo,4,0,"sometimes, you just need to go back to the beginning of a level and start over."
duolingo,4,0,i feel like a miss things and i can't get it by just reviewing.
duolingo,4,0,i would give 5 stars if it had this feature.
duolingo,4,1,very helpful and fun pp although i'd wish they's speak the words slower and more accurately.
duolingo,4,1,it's very difficult to understand and pronounce the words while they speak them so fast.
duolingo,4,1,"also i think it would be helpful to cooperate the grammar in the beginning for learning words and apes so that learning words will be easier, especially for adults who know their grammar in their language."
duolingo,4,3,pretty good pp.
duolingo,4,3,i just download it and have all ready learned a lot.
duolingo,4,3,great selection of languages.
duolingo,4,3,very easy to learn and the pp slowly increases difficulty.
duolingo,4,3,the only problem is that since you are learning something new you are going the make mistakes and the whole heart thing ruins that.
duolingo,4,3,it's a learning process and there has to be a little room for error.
duolingo,4,3,please improve this function.
duolingo,4,3,thanks 😊
duolingo,4,1,overall a very good pp to get you interested in learning a new language.
duolingo,4,1,"only downside is, as you progress the chapters tend to get repetition."
duolingo,4,1,it needs more interactive innovative ways to check earners knowledge than asking them to type the same answers again and again for 20 times per chapter.
duolingo,4,1,goal is to make the learner proficient in conversation in new language than checking if types it correctly.
duolingo,4,1,but a good beginner pp.
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp.
duolingo,4,0,it helps you learn quickly and retain the information.
duolingo,4,0,i only wish you would add iceland as well.
duolingo,4,0,"great discovery, clever way of using a game set to make learning fun."
duolingo,4,0,it does motivate you to keep at it.
duolingo,4,0,"absolutely love the new ""short stories"" feature!"
duolingo,4,0,they're interactive!
duolingo,4,0,awesome!
duolingo,4,0,very useful for learning french.
duolingo,4,0,i have to say that i had passed the beginning levels in a class and that is why it was easy for me.
duolingo,4,0,otherwise it should provide an opportunity to teach alphabet to earners.
duolingo,4,0,"bow, from the second level i couldn't hear the voices."
duolingo,4,0,i don't know how to report the problem!
duolingo,4,0,"fun learning, few stitches where it wasn't showing the sentence for me to translate."
duolingo,4,0,i had to exit out and lose progress.
duolingo,4,5,very helpful.
duolingo,4,5,"i've been using this for three years now, and i'm glad that i have improved my skill over time."
duolingo,4,5,"i recommended it to some of my friends, and they loved it."
duolingo,4,5,loved the weekly banking challenges and the achievements.
duolingo,4,5,they keep me motivate.
duolingo,4,5,i just hope you add more languages and explanations whenever i get something wrong.
duolingo,4,5,it's pretty hard understanding it myself.
duolingo,4,5,😅
duolingo,4,0,"it was a very good experience for me learning french with domingo, until recently i have found a bothering problem with sounds, i'm reporting the problem of sound missing in every single exercise and it's still there."
duolingo,4,0,"now i'm considering leaving domingo, without sounds playing it's more likely waste of time for me."
duolingo,4,0,thanks for the good days
duolingo,4,0,a bit too much forceful and overlay motivation.
duolingo,4,0,"too many interruption to the lessons, too much focus on bones based on gazing theory."
duolingo,4,0,but it might be only because i am older and know what i want.
duolingo,4,0,"main issue is the interaction of the pp with the phone keyboard and dictionary, an improvement would really help."
duolingo,4,1,really good pp.
duolingo,4,1,"really enjoying it and have a nice bit of competition with the wife who's also using it, which is motivation."
duolingo,4,1,it's fun and well designed.
duolingo,4,1,"my only piece of constructive criticism is: it's not clear to me in what order i should progress through the topics, as you sometimes have access to a 'subject 2' before having attempted other 'subject 1's."
duolingo,4,1,perhaps this could be a feature of the 'tips'.
duolingo,4,1,i definitely recommend domingo
duolingo,4,0,i do appreciate the work and time that went into producing the rumania course.
duolingo,4,0,"it's utility is greatly lessened, however, by the frequently incompetent or confusing translations, which make it impossible to know what the rumania actually means."
duolingo,4,0,i t is imperative that these at least be reviewed by a native english speaker!
duolingo,4,0,"so far, so good."
duolingo,4,0,"covers reading, hearing, writing, speaking, translating from and to."
duolingo,4,0,pretty awesome to learn 3 languages at once... just that sometimes one can't hear what the assistant is saying.. i am a big fan..
duolingo,4,0,"i have no idea if it's teaching me latin american spanish or european spanish, but being a beginner, it might not matter right now."
duolingo,4,0,"one annoying detail, is that the lessons accept the ""down arrow / new line"" button on the andros keypad as an alternate enter button, in addition to their ""check results"" button."
duolingo,4,0,"since the ""new line"" button is right below the backspace button, i often submit an incorrect answer when i'm only trying to correct a type."
duolingo,4,0,"(are you listening, pp developer?)"
duolingo,4,0,"great pp, would like to hear more of the sentences spoken in welsh to make pronunciation easier"
duolingo,4,123,"this pp provides a very fun, enjoyable approach to starting to learn a language."
duolingo,4,123,i find it has just enough to keep you coming back and invested.
duolingo,4,123,it does come up short when it comes to rewarding your progression outside of the leaderboards.
duolingo,4,123,i would like more things in the shop to add more incentive and motivation.
duolingo,4,123,i pretty much bought everything there was with in game currency in the first month.
duolingo,4,123,despite this i still keep coming back to maintain a streak.
duolingo,4,9,"in general, domingo is a great pp!"
duolingo,4,9,i'm learning german and enjoying it so on that note it is good.
duolingo,4,9,however there it told me that i had to complete a lesson to enter the gold league.
duolingo,4,9,i completed two and it still tells me to complete a lesson.
duolingo,4,9,please fix this issue.
duolingo,4,9,another issue
duolingo,4,9,1. it isn't there on my lawton.
duolingo,4,9,2. it's discouraging
duolingo,4,9,"everyone makes mistakes, especially beginners!"
duolingo,4,0,"well in all its a good pp, many choice for languages, great examples, etc."
duolingo,4,0,the only issue i have with this pp is that you have hearts and if you lose your hearts you can't learn for a little.
duolingo,4,0,people came to this pp to learn and you guns are taking that away just because we miss 5 questions.
duolingo,4,0,in all it is a good pp but that's the only issue.
duolingo,4,0,"good pp, makes learning fun to do and feels like a more natural way to develop linguistic skill."
duolingo,4,0,"only complaint is that the speaking part never works for me, not sure why microphone works with other apes."
duolingo,4,0,also i'm not keen on the apples.
duolingo,4,0,it feels like you are too heavily penalized for making mistakes.
duolingo,4,4,pretty great pp if you want to learn a new language.
duolingo,4,4,looking at the comments on a question can help you a lot to understand how the language works as well.
duolingo,4,4,one thing i would like to see for this to be a 5* rating would be to add the notes for lessons that the pp version can access.
duolingo,4,4,"while learning organ, i got super lost when it just threw particles into the mix of things, and ended up having to go onto my pp to check the notes on how they work, which isn't very convenient."
duolingo,4,0,"unlike previous language-learning experiences, i find domingo highly adjective."
duolingo,4,0,which hopefully will make a difference.
duolingo,4,0,time will tell.
duolingo,4,0,"only on stage 2, 3 days use."
duolingo,4,0,i really like this pp.
duolingo,4,0,it is very helpful and easy to understand.
duolingo,4,0,it makes learning english simple and funny.
duolingo,4,0,it's a excellent pp for those people who don't know how to speak in english.
duolingo,4,0,this pp teach us english through hind.
duolingo,4,0,there are graphics too good.😍
duolingo,4,0,"great pp, my only grip is the hearts system as it really interests the learning flow, but i understand why they have it."
duolingo,4,0,good for new earners and beginners but few exercises are repetition and that makes learning boring sometimes........more regional languages need to be added.
duolingo,4,0,great learning pp for angel but not for pronunciation.
duolingo,4,0,they need to improve the audit.
duolingo,4,0,other apes are better for this.
duolingo,4,0,"i like the pp, it's just why do you only get a certain amount of hearts."
duolingo,4,0,if you lose< how come you have to quit and lose all your progress.
duolingo,4,0,that needs to be fixed.
duolingo,4,0,great pp i feel like i'm learning more here than in spanish class.
duolingo,4,0,my only complaints are i think the hearts should be unlimited.
duolingo,4,0,i like learning spanish and i can't do that if it's limiting me on how many mistakes i'm allowed to make.
duolingo,4,0,and when i do the speaking test i'm positive i'm saying it right and it doesn't process right sometimes and i loose a heart.
duolingo,4,0,"great way to learn, fun and quick to make progress without realising it."
duolingo,4,6,"it's great for learning the basis of a language, but as you get better and clock more tense, it becomes a follette."
duolingo,4,6,"the single sentences don't give you enough context to know if you should use indicative preterite, indicative preterite imperfectly or any other past tense."
duolingo,4,6,"this is not consistent in the pp, and it drives me mad."
duolingo,4,6,"the same goes for many adjective, like the difference of being kind, good, nice and so on."
duolingo,4,6,you really shouldn't be punished for mixing those up.
duolingo,4,0,"very good learning pp, made me start to learn russian and now i can talk to russian players in is:go."
duolingo,4,0,"sadly, i can't sign in."
duolingo,4,0,it just stands there after clinking the sign in button.
duolingo,4,14,this pp is really great for learning a new language.
duolingo,4,14,i feel like i have made good progress after just a third of a year.
duolingo,4,14,"but there are updated that make me feel as though my learning is not as in depth as it was in the beginning, for example every category level only has four sets of questions before leveling up whereas in three beginning there were sets of up to 20 questions."
duolingo,4,14,i would give the pp 5 stars if only some of the recent changes had not been made..
duolingo,4,41,i love this pp.
duolingo,4,41,i gave it four stars because it incorporated competition and i don't necessarily want that in a learning pp.
duolingo,4,41,it puts more pressure on me to not lose my arbitrary place in the ranks.
duolingo,4,41,i have enough to deal with in real life.
duolingo,4,41,even the idea of worrying about losing my streak or place on a leader board is unwanted stress.
duolingo,4,41,"otherwise, absolutely perfect a. i'm learning so much so quickly!"
duolingo,4,3,i really like the pp and gives an around education for language.
duolingo,4,3,i only wish the subscription fee was lower.
duolingo,4,3,"for a 12 month subscription you're still paying 7.69, only 30 cents less a month than the 6 months plan, to me it's just to much even though i want to support the pp, i'm just a student so my income isn steady enough for that"
duolingo,4,0,"after initial slight disappointment, i'm beginning to learn the value of this pp."
duolingo,4,0,"it goes a little slowly for me, but there again, i could always spend more time on it than i currently do and it probably gets more difficult as time goes on."
duolingo,4,0,not bad at all.
duolingo,4,0,i might go to 5* once i've got more experience at a more advanced level.
duolingo,4,0,"i like the pp, i like the languages it promotes and the learning program and everything."
duolingo,4,0,"but what i don't like is that i have to wait like 5 hours for 1 heart, so you can't really make mistakes when that's part of learning a new language."
duolingo,4,0,"so, that's the only part i don't like."
duolingo,4,0,i think we should get more hearts like 5 hearts in an hour.
duolingo,4,0,i like the pp.
duolingo,4,0,"a bit repetition, but makes sense from a language learning perspective."
duolingo,4,0,"currently new user this language pp, which seems alright."
duolingo,4,0,"mostly words clear by voice, but sometimes voice seems low."
duolingo,4,0,good language translated
duolingo,4,0,it's easy to learn but would like to have more hearts for when new words are introduced and missed to continue learning.
duolingo,4,0,i only started using the pp a few days ago and it has helped me learn new french words and also helped improved my pronunciation.
duolingo,4,0,it is fun and makes learning easy!
duolingo,4,0,i do have a small problem though.
duolingo,4,0,"when it tells me to speak, i don't know what part i said wrong so i can't fix it."
duolingo,4,0,please help me.
duolingo,4,0,pretty good but hard to progress at times.
duolingo,4,0,has me looking to other apes sites and video just to make sense of it
duolingo,4,5,"i use this pp to help me learn japanese, so i can't comment on other languages."
duolingo,4,5,"but it's overall a fantastic learning tool, though isn't the best for adequately learning the language."
duolingo,4,5,the only thing that keeps it 4 star is that there is a lack of grammar explanation and the insistence to use anti.
duolingo,4,5,"there should be little to no anti early on, as it makes it so much harder to learn new words since the anti characters are insanely complicated"
duolingo,4,0,really great.
duolingo,4,0,just not 5 stars as there is not an option to change american english for british english as user's native language
duolingo,4,0,"i started using domingo on my phone, did some good progress in arabic."
duolingo,4,0,now i download it on my tablet and can find arabic in my course!!
duolingo,4,0,please fix the problem.
duolingo,4,0,thanks.
duolingo,4,0,one of my all-time favorite apes.
duolingo,4,0,for those whom education is unfordable or inaccessible this is a great pp to help learn language.
duolingo,4,0,it's best for adults but great for kiss in that it helps them also read in their first language.
duolingo,4,0,this pp could be improved if it had the ability to have multiple users in one account... eg: in perhaps a similar format to the way netflix has for multiple users on one a/c.
duolingo,4,0,i'd be willing to pay more to remove as for a family/group /school account.
duolingo,4,17,"this has been a great pp for a while now, it has really helped me with learning hungarian."
duolingo,4,17,but the new update has dulled the experience.
duolingo,4,17,"before there were more lessons per level, repeating phrases over and over, often getting them wrong, but learning from the mistakes made and progressing."
duolingo,4,17,"now, it has been simplifies, less lessons per level with less repetition, with an up driven promotion system to beat others on a leaderboard."
duolingo,4,17,apparently learning a language is now a competition.
duolingo,4,0,great pp and fun to use.
duolingo,4,0,only lost a star as i think it would be helpful to have a section on phrases you will need on travelling to italy earlier on which i personally would have found reassuring.
duolingo,4,0,"all the lessons are beneficial though, especially for a free pp & i can certainly recommend it."
duolingo,4,0,"this game is some, i got to choose what language i wanted i got to skin but with a test .but i have a down side the test said that less than 4 wrong answers then you pass but i got 2 and i failed soooooo you have to fix that mister/missis bye people!"
duolingo,4,0,"good with basis, but you would have thought the as pay for the lessons, bit you have to get these heart things which discourages you from learning."
duolingo,4,0,it's very helpful and easy to use..loved this pp!!
duolingo,4,0,but i'd like to add that while learning organ i saw that it doesn't reaches about bowels and consonants first but jumps into characters..so that was a bit hard to learn as i didn't know..but the pp is great for learning new languages!
duolingo,4,0,and i love the podcasts too!
duolingo,4,18,i like it clot but if i had not previously doubled in the language i would be totally lost.
duolingo,4,18,i wish they had something that explains the tense of words it really would be helpful.
duolingo,4,18,"i also hate that when your out of hearts you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can play again, unless you accumulate them through practice runs."
duolingo,4,18,like i said if i had not doubled in the language in my younger years i would have thrown my phone across the room and quit.
duolingo,4,0,really enjoying and getting a lot out of domingo.
duolingo,4,0,i speak three languages and learning a fourth.
duolingo,4,0,"although there is usually plenty of information floating around the web, it would be nice if there were relevant references and complimentary material built-in or linked to from the pp."
duolingo,4,0,"other than that, nice job guns :)"
duolingo,4,5,"great tool, easy to stick with."
duolingo,4,5,a bit silly (owl) but that's fine.
duolingo,4,5,my one complaint is the default speech speed setting.
duolingo,4,5,it's absurdly slow with no user ability to set default to normal.
duolingo,4,5,yes you can easily reply the dialogue at normal speed but the action interrupt the flow.
duolingo,4,5,fix that one flaw and in my opinion it would be a near perfect pp.
duolingo,4,0,great to use every day but hard to change the language.
duolingo,4,0,otherwise great idea.
duolingo,4,6,up??
duolingo,4,6,ink if it's a problem with my phone or the new update like it used to work fine but i don't hear anything anymore?
duolingo,4,6,"like when i'm doing japanese and it's supposed to say the sound a letter makes it just like, doesn't??"
duolingo,4,6,?
duolingo,4,6,"kind ruins the whole experience for me since you know, i don't know what sound the letter makes, and how am i even supposed to ""type what i hear"" when i don't hear anything,, but i don't want to give a bad review since it might just be my phone, don't see how the."
duolingo,4,0,"everything is great and as a training it is 👌, but i would avoid it if you start from ground zero."
duolingo,4,1,mostly good.
duolingo,4,1,i'm no expert at language learning but i think this is quite effective at it.
duolingo,4,1,"one thing i wish they'd change is the inclusion of a dictionary, or some kind of word list."
duolingo,4,1,"if i've forgotten a word and want to look out up, i'll have to red the lesson and just hope it comes up again."
duolingo,4,0,it's a great pp but sometimes the hints don't exactly help you with questions.
duolingo,4,0,plus some languages don't have the tips section.
duolingo,4,0,they are only features on the computer version.
duolingo,4,0,it should be available to all.
duolingo,4,0,i'm learning russian and there is no tips page so i have to assume what the ending of the noun is.
duolingo,4,0,hopefully domingo will change this.
duolingo,4,1,excellent and getting better.
duolingo,4,1,a bit harder for beginners with no knowledge.
duolingo,4,1,"would like to see more done, such a new fun and situation activities."
duolingo,4,1,the new reading one is excellent!
duolingo,4,1,there's also not much content regarding what you can spend your lights on.
duolingo,4,1,"idioms, flirting phrases and 3 outfits is it so far."
duolingo,4,1,"would love a range of outfits to motivate me to earn more lights, or a house!"
duolingo,4,1,would also love that to be available.
duolingo,4,1,great for not letting my a level knowledge get rusty after years :).
duolingo,4,0,too many as and disruption in the free version.
duolingo,4,0,therefore difficult to truly evaluate.
duolingo,4,0,"i have an opinion as a andros developer, it could be great if we had a section that saves words we learned as flash cards for practicing later"
duolingo,4,0,great and free.
duolingo,4,0,unfortunately doesn work well put of good wife bones - clashes and fails to work on g
duolingo,4,12,"amazing, well designed, well meaning, motivation, and useful."
duolingo,4,12,i can already see some impressive results!
duolingo,4,12,"i'd give it five stars if the interface regarding the friends could be a little more intuition, i've had trouble finding friends and i can only see who i'm following, not who's following me."
duolingo,4,12,"other than that, incredible work!"
duolingo,4,0,it's a lot of fun and i would recommend it to anyone who is totally new to a language.
duolingo,4,0,sadly enough you can't start at a higher level
duolingo,4,3,the pp has been good.
duolingo,4,3,i hold off on saying great more for personal reasons.
duolingo,4,3,"at this time, i am using the free mode."
duolingo,4,3,"i'm on a 13 day streak of using it daily, and i'm currently trying to learn spanish & french."
duolingo,4,3,it's great having access to a language learning resource in my pocket (telephone).
duolingo,4,3,i wish i would've had something like this back in high school.
duolingo,4,3,i am enjoying being exposed to words/concepts daily.
duolingo,4,3,i'd love to learn more and look forward to what's to come.
duolingo,4,4,i download domingo to learn arabic.
duolingo,4,4,"it's a powerful learning tool for sure, and the interface is intuition and well thought out."
duolingo,4,4,"however, for learning arabic, i would tread with caution, as the lessons have a bad habit of mixing modern standard arabic with dialect arabic, which should never be done."
duolingo,4,4,"because of this, i've stopped using the pp and moved on to a study guaranteed to reach only ma."
duolingo,4,4,"for other languages, this pp is a no brazier."
duolingo,4,1,"overall, very good."
duolingo,4,1,"however, i would like to see an additional possible answer for the sentence translations, and maybe also a feature for you to fill in missing phrases on a hypothetical conversation between two or three people."
duolingo,4,1,a nice dark mode would also be appreciated.
duolingo,4,0,it's a good pp for languages but the mobile version has hearts unless you buy the premium version other than that it really good.
duolingo,4,0,looks great but it didn't have that.
duolingo,4,0,i find that too be very strange when there are so many lesser spoken languages
duolingo,4,15,"if i was rating only the learning experience, 5 stars."
duolingo,4,15,the lessons are fun and effective.
duolingo,4,15,"i'm learning so much, and enjoying the process."
duolingo,4,15,the pp itself is 4 stars.
duolingo,4,15,"it frequently freeze, and random doesn't record my progress."
duolingo,4,15,there also seems to be issues singing between the webster and the pp.
duolingo,4,15,"i would like to see the stories on the pp, not just the site."
duolingo,4,15,and it would be nice to be able to collapse the lessons once you pass a checkpoint.
duolingo,4,15,all that strolling is tedious.
duolingo,4,15,:) and a vocal review.
duolingo,4,0,it's a great pp to lean the basis of any language you're interested in.
duolingo,4,0,the only thing that i would like to see in the future is a vocabulary list or some other way to see all the words you have learned so far without doing all the courses.
duolingo,4,0,it would be great if that could be added in the next update.
duolingo,4,149,very good pp for basic learning.
duolingo,4,149,"the only downside is that it does not explain rules or basis, so the approach is really intuition (a guessing game sometimes, and left to your interpretation of the rules as you go along in learning translations)."
duolingo,4,149,"the approach to learning is fun and easy, though."
duolingo,4,149,no boring lessons.
duolingo,4,149,would be good if they had a reference portion if you want to understand grammar rules.
duolingo,4,72,good so far.
duolingo,4,72,learning japanese and i'm feeling like i'm retaining most of the information i'm given.
duolingo,4,72,very easy to use.
duolingo,4,72,"i understand the need for ad revenue and they do a really good job of giving as but not shoving them down your throat, but i only dislike the ""lives"" thing since they'll ask what a word is even though they haven't taught you so you'll get it wrong and then lose a life which you only have 5 of."
duolingo,4,72,"on the other hand the ""get 1 life"" thing makes me not dislike losing lives too much."
duolingo,4,4,probably best suited to those who like learning by example rather than rules.
duolingo,4,4,"however, i’ve found it very useful in starting a language, spanish in my case, several years after a full set of university courses."
duolingo,4,4,plumes: -free mode is legitimate useful and as aren’t very intrusion.
duolingo,4,4,"and don’t worry, you can turn off the owl’s pestering “support” and modifications."
duolingo,4,4,"-de team is responsive, if slower than ideal."
duolingo,4,4,they’ve implements previous suggestions like adding pages for each subject explaining relevant rules (for spanish) and allowing words to be snapped in the build a phrase with included words exercises (at least in the phone pp).
duolingo,4,4,they appear to continue adding different correct pleasing/translations that will be accepted.
duolingo,4,4,-easy to switch between using a phone and computer brother.
duolingo,4,4,-i haven’t had any real stitches in a long time.
duolingo,4,4,i used to have issues where the pp would forget i completed a lesson but oddly kept the experience points.
duolingo,4,4,much may have been due to my poor data connection with a previous cellular provider.
duolingo,4,4,downloading lessons (with subscription) was not very useful to me.
duolingo,4,4,"suggestions: - allow editing of previous wrong answers rather than requiring recently, especially when the mistake is a small type -desperately needs a greater variety of phrases."
duolingo,4,4,translating something 10 times is no longer beneficial repetition but annoying rose memorization -long term goal: exercises would ideally adjust difficulty on the fly to the user’s skill level.
duolingo,4,1,in general i love the pp but two things are odd (i'm using it for japanese - don't know whether it appears in other languages): 1. i've heard it is not possible to change how the speaker reads certain anti (symbols) but very often the other (more complex) reading are used 2. the volume levels are off.
duolingo,4,1,the speakers voice volumes are very very low (in comparison to other phone applications) and the wrong/correct sound is very loud - increasing volume hurts ears
duolingo,4,1,"helpful in learning the formal version of a language, but not as much the common conversational version."
duolingo,4,1,"reaches through repetition, which is a good approach, but doesn't teach some of the challenging parts, especially verb conjunction, in a manner that is easily understood or even organized."
duolingo,4,1,i almost stopped doing spanish out of frustration.
duolingo,4,1,would easily give this 5 stars if it taught verb conjugations in an organized manner in the beginning.
duolingo,4,1,"i love this pp, i definitely think its been a big help to learning japanese give never even thought about reading japanese before but now in getting close to being able to."
duolingo,4,1,"i wish it would have you draw the characters as well, maybe that comes later on?"
duolingo,4,1,"i definitely can write it, but can tell you what it is, so maybe that an addition they could add someday to the program?"
duolingo,4,1,otherwise it would be 5 stars!
duolingo,4,2,the new garlic course is well written and well thought out.
duolingo,4,2,"the only reason it is not 5 stars is one of the voices has too thick an accent to hear properly, and it is only on guess work that i get the words and phrases correct when her voice is used."
duolingo,4,2,"very, very quick work to get it online."
duolingo,4,2,congratulations to the epic volunteers 🙂
duolingo,4,1,good for memorizing vocabulary although in basic unintuitive sentences.
duolingo,4,1,would do better with more spoken practice and photo/art to truly cement concepts in your mind.
duolingo,4,1,"""stories"" are a great feature."
duolingo,4,1,i feel this program could/should be accompanied with a tutor (not a high school language class) and you would expel fast.
duolingo,4,0,"being dutch, it is interesting to use this pp but often very frustration, particularly with computer voices that race through a sentence with the consequence of misunderstanding the words."
duolingo,4,0,"the translations into english are often strange to my ears, obviously 'dictionary translations' and not in english vernacular, having unusual placement of nous and verbs."
duolingo,4,0,"suggestions from users are, however, mostly accepted."
duolingo,4,0,"the dutch is often extra long minded, not simple to translate, even for me."
duolingo,4,0,very fun and helpful tool to dear a new language!
duolingo,4,0,"though i dislike the heart mechanics, i do under stand why its there."
duolingo,4,0,good pp overall.
duolingo,4,0,but the listening part does not work on my galaxy s+ as nothing plays back when i touch the button.
duolingo,4,149,"it is a great pp, especially if you want to practice vocabulary."
duolingo,4,149,"i have a couple of suggestions: 1) the sentences are never too complicated and they rarely used vocabulary from previously completed lessons; 2) in the word selection pool most of the time the first word has a capital letter, which makes it too easy to identify."
duolingo,4,149,"that's a pity, because many times the first word is an article and identifying the gender is a challenging part in some languages."
duolingo,4,0,as a beginner its a fantastic pp... but whether we'll be able to learn the language completely??
duolingo,4,0,but still its an amazing pp to learn languages i find it interesting and fun😍😘
duolingo,4,22,great pp for learning languages.
duolingo,4,22,"i only wish it allowed for tying the answers instead of multiple choice “tapping,” which is too easy."
duolingo,4,22,"when a sentence has seven words in it and there are only ten choice, you hardly need to know much of the language to figure it out."
duolingo,4,22,it would be much better if we could enter the answers from memory like on the domingo webster.
duolingo,4,22,seeing how they have this feature on the webster (hence the apt for it already exists) it shouldn't be too hard to make this change.
duolingo,4,3,really great for free version!
duolingo,4,3,i have had a great experience using this for the last week.
duolingo,4,3,refreshing my spanish because i've lost connection to my mother tongue.
duolingo,4,3,"for new languages however, i'd like for there to be writing included."
duolingo,4,3,"i can type in the spanish, but for the organ and japanese there isn't even tracing."
duolingo,4,3,wondering if it'sin the works as i'ma hands on learner.
duolingo,4,3,i also have the keyboard download on my phone to use as an option.
duolingo,4,3,hope to see this included if it's not.
duolingo,4,3,:)
duolingo,4,1,the new progress quite is no good as it's asking questions i've not learned.
duolingo,4,1,brilliant pp that make learning easy.
duolingo,4,1,"would like to see questions reduced to 15 not 20 per session and the ""type what you hear"" needs to be a little bit more clearer but it's more realistic but sometimes hard to distinguish."
duolingo,4,1,overall it's the best pp out there and i've paid for others where you can do this free
duolingo,4,0,this pp is very helpful.
duolingo,4,0,i installed it so i could learn spanish and french for school.
duolingo,4,0,"i have to say that i knew no spanish whatsoever, and now i am getting better at it."
duolingo,4,0,the only thing i would change is to remove the hearts thing.
duolingo,4,0,you only get 5 hearts at a time.
duolingo,4,0,"and if your a started like me, then you are probably donna make mistakes."
duolingo,4,0,"also, when you are supposed to speak into the microphone, it doesn't hear me and counts in wrong."
duolingo,4,0,"if these 2 things weren an issue, this pp would get 5 stars"
duolingo,4,11,"i really enjoy do in the past, but i don't like the new leveling system."
duolingo,4,11,every stage there is only a few repetition(lesson) and we also have to answer more question in each lesson which increase the probability to lose the heart more.
duolingo,4,11,and i have lose some points when i use double point(the point is not recorded to the system)
duolingo,4,1,helps memorizing words in contest.
duolingo,4,1,"i use german and spanish, two languages that i want to improve; japanese, hebrew, norwegian, and hawaiian from scratch."
duolingo,4,1,do makes it easy to start.
duolingo,4,1,"it helps me to improve my english as well, since do doesn't tolerate mistakes in english."
duolingo,4,1,i checked out russian since my kid is learning it.
duolingo,4,1,"this one is not there yet, but i've heard it improved a lot."
duolingo,4,1,besides do allows to report problems.
duolingo,4,1,"my biggest complain it doesn't have iceland, georgian, and bulgaria."
duolingo,4,57,"a great pp, and i can't imagine how difficult it must be to develop something so complicated that works so brilliantly."
duolingo,4,57,i just have one minor grumble about the 'practise to restore' feature: it's a great idea but to me i'm spending more time restoring completed levels than progressing on new ones.
duolingo,4,57,could the regularity be reduced please?
duolingo,4,57,"it is the only reason i haven't given 5 stars, which is probably quite unfair as everything else is great and improving my spanish."
duolingo,4,57,gracious!
duolingo,4,0,"it's a bit hard for me at first, but you'll get use to its way of teaching in no time, and it has several different languages you can learn, it helped me and my friend clot.. i really recommend this pp, i actually think it is the best pp of teaching languages.. i mean c'mon!"
duolingo,4,0,it's free!
duolingo,4,0,and u can use it office too!
duolingo,4,0,thank you creator 😁👌👍
duolingo,4,1,"overall, domingo has been very helpful."
duolingo,4,1,"though rather than only certain sample phrases and conversations, ideally there would also be explanations of principles and usage (such as when to use a particular form of a word), as well as a wider array of vocabulary, lending toward a more comprehensive understanding of a language."
duolingo,4,4,probably the best free tool.
duolingo,4,4,"lingvist , the pp, is much better as it initially tests to see how much you know already."
duolingo,4,4,"but lingvist is not completely free, so there's that."
duolingo,4,4,"the messages that show up on screen are so repetition, there should be at least 200 messages, and not that random."
duolingo,4,4,"example: you try 4 times to get an answer right, you should get ""i'm proud of you, well done""."
duolingo,4,4,not for the easy words that you already knew
duolingo,4,0,i love it!
duolingo,4,0,"it's fun and easy to learn, i haven't completed my chosen language yet, i'm actually pretty new."
duolingo,4,0,i wish there was a way to chat with people you follow or easily find people who are native speakers to your language or are learning the same language as you.
duolingo,4,0,i think that would help conversational skill for people learning a new language and i also think it would be really fun.
duolingo,4,0,"other than that, even though i'm new, it has a nice and simple i and it makes lessons fun."
duolingo,4,1,the finest pp in the world😐 without no responding to email😒 i asked them lots of times to solve my problem but they didn't care😒 the listening exercises doesn' work for me at all.
duolingo,4,0,a very good way to learn the basis of a language.
duolingo,4,0,"fun and quite adjective, which makes you want to keep using it."
duolingo,4,0,dose not hold your hand.
duolingo,4,0,forces you to read new words you haven't learned to figure out the language.
duolingo,4,0,just like real life.
duolingo,4,0,i love it.
duolingo,4,0,good pp.
duolingo,4,0,need an option for quick access to all previously learnt content.
duolingo,4,0,even a bookmarking feature would be helpful.
duolingo,4,4,the pp is great!....
duolingo,4,4,"when it works.🤦‍♀️ for those having office courses not downloading, i just cleared my data under the domingo pp in settings and it fixed my issue."
duolingo,4,4,"i had to log back in, but at least it was better than waiting a week for a response from their team (that never happened)."
duolingo,4,4,"besides this one bug and no email response 🤷‍♀️, the pp is great."
duolingo,4,4,😊
duolingo,4,4,nice gentle into to a language but it takes clot of lessons to get very far into the language mainly because of all the repetiveness.
duolingo,4,4,i guess it's needed to learn the language but it's really annoying to keep doing the same words over and over again.
duolingo,4,4,would like a little more variety and challenge.
duolingo,4,4,bow i'm learning french.
duolingo,4,0,method of teaching a new language is truly amazing.
duolingo,4,0,i am learning japanese which is entirely entirely new for me.
duolingo,4,13,"update: i did really like this pp, i loved that you could earn your hearts to continue leaning and they took that option away, it's really hard to continue without having to pay, wish they would go back to the way it was..while a bit repetition in some ways, and some odd phrases this is actually very good and i feel that i'll be learning many languages in no time!"
duolingo,4,13,i'd highly recommend it
duolingo,4,0,just started but so far so good.
duolingo,4,0,"i was using rabble and there are some parts to both i like, but i like the ""kind"" game format and that it can be used for free."
duolingo,4,0,bonus points for helping educate for free even if there is a paid version.
duolingo,4,2,i think this pp is a good pp.
duolingo,4,2,it has many good languages that you can learn.
duolingo,4,2,i like that it groups everything into certain learning groups.
duolingo,4,2,it has fun little games that help you to learn the language you want.
duolingo,4,2,"the only thing i don't like about it is that if you dont have any hearts you can't keep learning, until you get more hearts."
duolingo,4,2,other than that it is a great pp for learning new languages.
duolingo,4,0,remarkable pp but ruined by consistent bags don't format the pp display to my screen which makes me unable to select answers for lessons.
duolingo,4,0,on a galaxy s
duolingo,4,2,"comments relating only to version i have used, which is french."
duolingo,4,2,comments here relate to my experience with the first level.
duolingo,4,2,very easy to get into.
duolingo,4,2,mix of 'written' and verbal excellent in linking words and pronunciation.
duolingo,4,2,i had learnt the language to the old ice 'o level' and used it a little in leisure travel and business introduction (though never in negotiations) and was greatly encouraged by how quickly it prompted my recollections within the different topics in the programme nodules.
duolingo,4,37,great pp for learning a new language.
duolingo,4,37,lessons are quick and the as aren't terrible - just one at the end of each lesson.
duolingo,4,37,"the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the speaking portions; i'm taking organ, so i don't know if the other languages are like this, but the lady talks way too fast."
duolingo,4,37,"there's no option for her to speak more slowly, or to say the sentence in parts."
duolingo,4,37,it'd be helpful if you could practice the sentence in parts more slowly before trying to repeat the whole thing.
duolingo,4,27,the pp is extremely useful and i'm learning quickly but i feel it should focus on more general conversation points first rather than jumping straight into subjects like reading and eating!
duolingo,4,27,"questions like ""how are you"" and responses to questions like this!"
duolingo,4,27,"but other than that.. this is a quick and easy way to learn, i'm doing double the required time a day just because it's fun!"
duolingo,4,5,i love this pp.
duolingo,4,5,i'm learning quite fast and i like that you can set daily goals!
duolingo,4,5,it makes me feel motivate.
duolingo,4,5,"i haven't left a review on an pp in 7 years, so the fact that i'm leaving one on this says something."
duolingo,4,5,"the only complaint that i have is after every lesson, it asks you to join premium."
duolingo,4,5,"generally i don't mind as, but constantly asking me to buy something i don't need is annoying."
duolingo,4,5,"plus, you can't skin through lessons you already know without premium."
duolingo,4,5,"i'm trying to remember the japanese i knew and learn some more with the pp, and i'm happy with it :) but i wish it showed how to write the anti or had a separate list in the chronological order of the pp, as it would make practicing easier."
duolingo,4,5,"and instead of two as after every lesson, it could be every other lesson?"
duolingo,4,5,it can get a little annoying at times.
duolingo,4,5,"overall, the most used pp on my phone!"
duolingo,4,1,my experience with domingo is going good enough so far.
duolingo,4,1,but i got encountered with a bug.
duolingo,4,1,"in language ""japanese"", before checkpoint ""1"", there's a study module named ""into 1""."
duolingo,4,1,i am unable to stroll to the bottom of this module's introduction/study content.
duolingo,4,1,till the mid of the content strolling works fine but suddenly everything gets refreshed and i get directed on my japanese dashboard screen automatically.
duolingo,4,1,rest all other nodules introduction are scrollable.
duolingo,4,1,dating the pp didn't help.
duolingo,4,0,great pp.
duolingo,4,0,"however, if you upgrade to the pro version it seems you get charged the whole annual cost in one go (after the free 7 day trial) which i cannot afford."
duolingo,4,0,the in pp messages you get suggesting to upgrade state £8-something a month.
duolingo,4,0,after smiling for clarification i received no reply so i had to cancel as paying my electric bill is more important.
duolingo,4,6,it's pretty good.
duolingo,4,6,"but in order to learn it better, you would write stuff down and you'll have to look at the comments section a lot."
duolingo,4,6,i think it would be better if they made the progress quit available to non-premium users.
duolingo,4,6,it would help a lot more users.
duolingo,4,6,"also it would be nice to have them add: as, filipino language, austrian, mexican native language and languages that are more rare."
duolingo,4,0,"the pp is great, especially if you are learning from scratch, but there are one or two little singles that i found difficult to get past."
duolingo,4,0,with japanese i went to another pp that moves through the lessons more slowly but gives me a more solid rounding in things i really need to know better.
duolingo,4,0,will you be adding barque to the list at some time?
duolingo,4,6,"having a fun time learning polish with this pp, its ad driven for revenue but the as are not in your face all the time which is nice, the learning format is fun and the progression is gentle."
duolingo,4,6,i can only compare to the roseola stone pp which is obviously a lot more expensive in comparison.
duolingo,4,6,"4 stars only because i would like to see a feature whereby it listens to my pronunciation, which roseola stone does have."
duolingo,4,6,if this was included i would definitely buy the premium.
duolingo,4,19,a great pp to get your feet wet in learning a new language.
duolingo,4,19,"sometimes, however, it is not always accurate."
duolingo,4,19,"for example, in a ""match the pairs"" part of the italian portion, it asks to match the english words with their italian translation."
duolingo,4,19,"well the final two remaining were ""press"" which means ""you're welcome "" in english, but the only remaining option to select was ""thank you""."
duolingo,4,19,this could be very confusing to many people!
duolingo,4,66,great practice.
duolingo,4,66,i already had some small experience with the language and knew a few words and conventions.
duolingo,4,66,i'm not sure how well it works if you had zero background.
duolingo,4,66,but this has been an excellent refreshed!
duolingo,4,66,"i'm using the free option, which means if a word comes up that i don't know, i lose a ""heart."""
duolingo,4,66,"once you lose 5 hearts you're pretty much done for the day, though the pp is generous with giving you tokens which can buy more hearts (gained via experience)."
duolingo,4,66,but overall i'm pleased!
duolingo,4,35,i can't stand the newest update where it wants me to review lessons i have already completed.
duolingo,4,35,i miss the clubs and not a fan of the leader board system.
duolingo,4,35,"i love the 'story' feature: i wish it was available in more languages, but i imagine development it's a lot of work and costly ."
duolingo,4,35,"overall, for being free, it's a great pp."
duolingo,4,35,"not roseola stone good, but is isn't free."
duolingo,4,35,i wouldn't bother paying for domingo plus as there wasn't much additional content.
duolingo,4,35,just no as
duolingo,4,26,pretty good pp for learning new words and phrases.
duolingo,4,26,"i've only gotten through a couple of lessons for one language, but so far it's been fun."
duolingo,4,26,"it's sort of admitting because of the leaderboards, the streaks, and the multiple levels for each lesson."
duolingo,4,26,helps to keep me motivate to finish learning the whole thing.
duolingo,4,26,i do think that some of the voice clips are cut poorly though.
duolingo,4,26,it's sometimes either cut too early or an little extra sound that shouldn't be there is left in.
duolingo,4,49,i don't actually begrudge the hearts system at all.
duolingo,4,49,"if you don't want to lose hearts, it's easy to check your answers online before submitting, and you can always get hearts back through practice sessions, which are genuinely worthwhile anyway."
duolingo,4,49,"the only downside is the pp makes no attempt (so far, anyway) at explaining the grammar rules/linguistic to you, so you have to figure that out for yourself."
duolingo,4,49,"also, there is the occasional pitch, for example the audit may not play first time round."
duolingo,4,6,"i love this pp, although not perfect it's very much appreciated."
duolingo,4,6,however i've been getting very annoyed for the last several weeks to have my streaks broken and have to do them to repair instead of continuing with the next lessons.
duolingo,4,6,i don't have a lot of time to use the pp.
duolingo,4,6,i do about 5 minutes a day.
duolingo,4,6,"it sucks to have to red my breaking streaks every day, or every other day."
duolingo,4,6,i would understand that once every few months you take quires but it's been happening every day for weeks.
duolingo,4,6,please fix
duolingo,4,1,"so far it's a good experience, it definitely helps with learning a language, only complaint i have is i wish they went through actual letters of the alphabet of a language, because i'm learning russian and it's hard to understand what the letters sound like individually and how they contrast to the english language."
duolingo,4,14,"love the pp for the most part, i took a foreign language in high school and college and enjoy the approach do is using much better."
duolingo,4,14,"i like that the lessons, they only take a few minutes, and they have added conversational stories."
duolingo,4,14,i have recently encountered a few issues.
duolingo,4,14,i complete lessons but it doesn't register with the pp or i buy a streak freeze and the next day my streak is back at zero.
duolingo,4,14,not major issues but little things that i like to use to keep me hooked and dedicated to the pp.
duolingo,4,0,"very good, only want to communicate casually, annoying to be punished for minor spelling mistakes but otherwise can't complain at all."
duolingo,4,0,"i love this pp, it should start full conversations though."
duolingo,4,0,that would help.
duolingo,4,14,"overall, i am loving this pp."
duolingo,4,14,where was it when i was in school?
duolingo,4,14,"however, i am running into some bags."
duolingo,4,14,i am unable to work on chinese greeting 2 because the sound is not properly working in that lesson.
duolingo,4,14,there have been other times where occasional words didn't make the sounds (mostly with chinese names) but i had already learned how they were spoken so could continue.
duolingo,4,14,"in this case, i can't hear what sound the characters are making."
duolingo,4,0,love the incentive.
duolingo,4,0,"( completing the circles, etc) but it's too pick about minor spelling errors."
duolingo,4,0,you have to keep tying a whole long complicated sentence over and over because of one or two small errors.
duolingo,4,0,the more complicated grammar is equally frustration.
duolingo,4,0,the more different grammar needs to start with simple tasks rather than whole sentence translations.
duolingo,4,10,this pp is pretty good and has a lot of languages to choose from.
duolingo,4,10,"however i can say it's the best to rely on for learning a new language, as learning a language is all about exposure to conversing with other people."
duolingo,4,10,"still, this pp gives a lot of words and phrases to know."
duolingo,4,10,it even explains how the language works and other grammar rules within the language.
duolingo,4,10,which is why i rate this 4/5 stars.
duolingo,4,10,"would be five if it taught more common phrases, that would be a little more helpful at the beginning."
duolingo,4,0,i really enjoy this pp for english to french.
duolingo,4,0,it does freeze regularly however which is frustration when you do the min at double up points.
duolingo,4,0,they now have the podcasts and tinycards features which are helpful too.
duolingo,4,0,what is really needed is more development of the speaking and conversation aspect then i wouldn't need all the other apes i also use.
duolingo,4,6,love this pp.
duolingo,4,6,"however, it is patiently obvious that there are many theaters in the league tables!"
duolingo,4,6,"for example - i complete a lesson is say 5 minutes or so, and earn 10/15 up points."
duolingo,4,6,"when i check my position in the league i see others who have suddenly earned 40, 50 or more up points."
duolingo,4,6,no one is that good or fast.
duolingo,4,6,"i know they are only footing themselves, but it spoils the chance to measure your progress accurately against others."
duolingo,4,6,thanks.
duolingo,4,6,bill s
duolingo,4,1,am enjoying learning spanish so much.
duolingo,4,1,domingo is making it so easy for me.
duolingo,4,1,i absolutely love the format and find it very beneficial.
duolingo,4,1,"however , losing hearts and being asked every few minutes re purchasing domingo plus , is a pain to be honest."
duolingo,4,1,i'd really like to go from level to level with no interruption & not to be told i will lose points.
duolingo,4,1,please make the learning easy to progress with.
duolingo,4,1,gracious.
duolingo,4,0,works as intended for the most part.
duolingo,4,0,some minor issues like having to open the pp twice.
duolingo,4,0,the brother based version is reliable.
duolingo,4,0,can't figure out why it won't have me speak anything anymore.
duolingo,4,0,"also completed in the top ten is a league, got a ratification saying i advanced, but i was left in the same league."
duolingo,4,2,the language pp i wish i had used before i visited a foreign country.
duolingo,4,2,"only 4 stars because the response to improvement suggestions seems basically non extent: suggestions i thought of had been suggested by others 3 & 5 years ago (include renders for appropriate vocabulary words on the list, be able to mark vocabulary you want to practice, be able to go through vocabulary flashcards) without any changes."
duolingo,4,2,"the rest of the pp is pretty enjoyable, though."
duolingo,4,17,"as a refreshed course, i would prefer less repetition lessons with more emphasis on building vocal."
duolingo,4,17,"i do like that speaking, reading, listening and writing are all developed all the time."
duolingo,4,17,"it does seem that grammar is more beneath the surface rather than out front and i'm not sure if that's best because some ""why""s go mentioned."
duolingo,4,17,"however, you can get that free elsewhere with most languages."
duolingo,4,17,"leader boards are motivation and get you to less familiar material faster, which is the point."
duolingo,4,0,a very interesting way of teaching languages.
duolingo,4,0,"however, dark mode is needed please."
duolingo,4,0,most of it is great except for the speaking portions of answers.
duolingo,4,0,it doesn't work.
duolingo,4,14,the pp is great!
duolingo,4,14,i use it everyday and i dont think there is anything else like it.
duolingo,4,14,i have a few suggestions though.
duolingo,4,14,"add a feature to set a higher daily goal (50 up is not enough) review some of the content on the languages (i was learning german and every activity got a bit boring as i was just repeating the exercise, it would be nice to break out of the same sentences) add the feature to leave courses (it's annoying seeing courses with 0 up) please add more languages."
duolingo,4,1,this is a whole lot better than other language learning apes.
duolingo,4,1,"i have tried others, but they are either repetition or to simple."
duolingo,4,1,some dont even give level to observe our progress.
duolingo,4,1,domingo has enabled me to learn japanese steadily and practically.
duolingo,4,1,the only complaint i have is
duolingo,4,1,but beggars can be chooses.¯\_(ツ)_/¯
duolingo,4,1,i've been using this in conjunction with roseola stone and i enjoy it because it has a more academic approach where is is more the immersion approach.
duolingo,4,1,would be 5 stars but for some reason the pp lost the option to type responses instead of using the word bank.
duolingo,4,1,i felt more challenged but also more retention when i had to actually write my responses in japanese and would love to get that option back.
duolingo,4,1,ありがとうございます!
duolingo,4,112,"great pp, very helpful."
duolingo,4,112,"my wife and i are learning french together, and we are having so much fun!"
duolingo,4,112,there is one issue i can think of.
duolingo,4,112,some of the achievements are begged.
duolingo,4,112,"i am currently in the ruby league, and for the achievement i need to be in the gold league."
duolingo,4,112,"however i've already completed the league, and did not get the achievement."
duolingo,4,112,"great pp, but please fix your achievements."
duolingo,4,5,it's a great language learning pp.
duolingo,4,5,rumania is too difficult starting for beginners.
duolingo,4,5,"japanese, has been improved tenfold, at least for beginners."
duolingo,4,5,"the speaking portions for french and spanish are nice, i hope they are added to other languages as well."
duolingo,4,5,the one thing i wish is that you would get partial credit/experience for failing a lesson.
duolingo,4,5,i always lose all the hearts when trying to learn rumania.
duolingo,4,15,love the pp and the ability to learn a new language in a find way and thanks for listening to the feedback.
duolingo,4,15,i like the new feature to revise and reinforce past skill but they crack too quickly at the moment as i'm visiting old skill every couple of days instead of moving forward.
duolingo,4,15,i just had three skill crack that's going to take me a day and a half to refill.
duolingo,4,15,i do like the new feature for learning you just need to weak the speed.
duolingo,4,0,a very very good pp for learning but i can't understand the concept behind the hearts in latest update.
duolingo,4,0,"your mission is to keep learning fun and free,as you said before but now it's neither fun nor free because it makes users to join plus edition to keep the pp fun!"
duolingo,4,0,your new update does not concentrate on user experience so it lacks the joy of using the pp.
duolingo,4,0,"the way how domingo learns you a language is in the beginning weird because you have to know a thing before, they're directly testing you without a first proper introduction of the language."
duolingo,4,0,"another thing, i want to learn slovenian but it doesn't exist (in the course list), but what does exist is clinton and high valyrian, ok i get it, it has probably more interest for people than slovenian but if want to go to slovenly than you've to learn it somewhere else."
duolingo,4,0,but excluding this it's a good pp
duolingo,4,20,good but toxic.
duolingo,4,20,the new hearts mechanics is only there to make the user purchase the pro version.
duolingo,4,20,if you happen to be completely new this will force your pace to be a crawl.
duolingo,4,20,"make a mistake, lose a heart."
duolingo,4,20,make another lose another heart.
duolingo,4,20,want to keep learning?
duolingo,4,20,buy the plan for $7 a month.
duolingo,4,20,can't pick up the language quickly enough just wait another day and hopefully you'll remember what mistake you made yesterday.
duolingo,4,20,can't remember just wait another day and hopefully you remember again.
duolingo,4,20,etc etc etc
duolingo,4,2,i enjoy this pp very much!
duolingo,4,2,very easy to use and navigable!
duolingo,4,2,"however i do not believe it is fair that the premium subscribers get to compete against the non premium in the weekly letterboards, as premium subscribers get unlimited hearts and non-premium do not."
duolingo,4,2,i suggest a premium letterboard and a non-premium to level the playing field.
duolingo,4,4,using the pp is fun.
duolingo,4,4,"the language ""placement test"" isn't very accurate, though, so even if you have basic knowledge of a language, you have to start at the beginner level, which is a bit frustration."
duolingo,4,4,"the i can be confusing at times if you click too fast, as the screens all look or function alike even when they're asking for different actions."
duolingo,4,1,it works as a refreshed if you already know the language.
duolingo,4,1,"but if you start completely new, i'm not sure how effective it is."
duolingo,4,1,"also, there are some problems with translation when comes to male/female and plural in some languages, like hebrew."
duolingo,4,1,"they don't specify it in english, which makes it impossible to translate correctly"
duolingo,4,12,i really love using this pp!
duolingo,4,12,it is frustration that it takes a while to regenerate your hearts after you have made mistakes!
duolingo,4,12,you can use the practice lessons to regenerate or just wait a long time for it to regenerate itself.
duolingo,4,12,however i have just been on a 29 day streak and today it obviously should've gone up to 30 and it has just gone back to 1!
duolingo,4,12,this is really disappointing and annoying!
duolingo,4,168,part of this pp is excellent.
duolingo,4,168,"learning can be a breeze most of the time, even if you have learn little bits of a language you where trying."
duolingo,4,168,"some problems of this pp is that it can loose track on how many hearts you have, or that it doesn't tell you where your correct position on the leaderboard is."
duolingo,4,168,"and sometimes lessons can be very difficult to finish, and can lead to keeping you softlock in a position in lessons."
duolingo,4,168,"but either less, this is a great pp!"
duolingo,4,168,keep on revolving!
duolingo,4,2,"the learning experience is fast and fun, and you will love to hate do!"
duolingo,4,2,"i don't have domingo plus, and the as on the basic version can get annoying, especially for a product which claims that it wants to make learning a language ""free and fun."""
duolingo,4,2,"having said that, i find it a unable and useful learning pp"
duolingo,4,0,domingo is a great starting point to learn a language.
duolingo,4,0,"if you're expecting to complete a course and be ""client"" in any language, you might be disappointed."
duolingo,4,0,"but if you're looking for a solid foundation presented in a fun and memorable way, from which you can continue to grow and study your language(s) of choice, this pp is my best recommendation."
duolingo,4,9,it's fun.
duolingo,4,9,they've ratified learning a new language.
duolingo,4,9,"sound cuts out on occasion, which resulted in losing hearts."
duolingo,4,9,you need those to keep learning.
duolingo,4,9,"there was an update that seems, so far, to have stopped the problem."
duolingo,4,9,hasn't denied the experience too much.
duolingo,4,9,i'm enjoying learning chinese (makarin) through this and i'm actually picking up the anti too.
duolingo,4,0,just started using it and it seems this is a great little pp.
duolingo,4,0,it is easy to use and intuition.
duolingo,4,0,one minor complaint is that you can't seem to back up and review the last item you got wrong to reinforce your understanding.
duolingo,4,0,but the progression seems effective so far.
duolingo,4,3,free.
duolingo,4,3,can grumble at free.
duolingo,4,3,"i don't even mind watching the as, though they are very repetition."
duolingo,4,3,"the quality is more than you would expect for free learning, though inconsistent across different languages."
duolingo,4,3,"i've not become client in a language yet, but my knowledge has certainly increased."
duolingo,4,3,"if i keep up my daily streak, i may even consider a subscription."
duolingo,4,3,"good job all around, highly recommended."
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp.
duolingo,4,0,it helps with my languages.
duolingo,4,0,"i would however, like some more languages."
duolingo,4,0,especially iceland!
duolingo,4,0,"for some reason it wont let my type ""la nina"" during the lesions."
duolingo,4,0,every time i use the space key la disappears.
duolingo,4,7,"excellent lingual pp, it would be nice to have the turtle button always on option because some sentences sound marbled at normal speed."
duolingo,4,7,other than that its enjoyable and i look forward to the lessons.
duolingo,4,7,"i got to a point i can no longer continue, they ask me to spell a word in russian but i have no way of doing that without downloading the russian keyboard."
duolingo,4,7,if i do that then how do i return to the english language not knowing russian?
duolingo,4,7,please help me figure out this so i may continue to learn.
duolingo,4,12,"the way domingo reaches is great; however, the pp is increasingly adding paywalls and is taking most user interactivity away."
duolingo,4,12,"sure, you can take the long way through the language, but it's time consuming and annoying."
duolingo,4,12,"clubs, which were a good way for users to learn from each other if kept active, were discontinued, and leaderboards replaced them."
duolingo,4,12,"leaderboards make people more competitive, but there's no way to root for each other or learn about others so that they are more than just numbers..."
duolingo,4,1,thanks for making the stories available on the pp!!
duolingo,4,1,it works great.
duolingo,4,1,when will the 'time practice' be available on the pp?
duolingo,4,1,currently it only works for desktop version.
duolingo,4,1,"since we have to upgrade the feature with lights, it's only fair that we are able to use 'time practice' in all devices."
duolingo,4,10,great pp so far.
duolingo,4,10,i am learning french and it has been a good refreshed.
duolingo,4,10,i like that it is based on practise and repetition in different formats and not just instructive.
duolingo,4,10,"i don't know yet how effective it is or if i will understand french construction rules on top of words and phrases, but that is my hope."
duolingo,4,10,"it would be helpful if there was a more accessible syllabus or map of progress for the whole course, but so far it is functional useful"
duolingo,4,3,this pp is pretty good.
duolingo,4,3,excellent way to either get a refreshed course of a language you took long ago or to learn a language from scratch.
duolingo,4,3,the only reason why i didn give it 5 stars is because of the lessons being a little too easy and repetition.
duolingo,4,3,"i guess it helps to drill the words and phrases into your head but trying to match a word in one ""quit"" then translate it right after just seems kind of boring and easy to me."
duolingo,4,7,i love domingo.
duolingo,4,7,simple and fun pp for learning any language.
duolingo,4,7,"that said, i really want a couple of updated - that we could exchange messages with our friends."
duolingo,4,7,"there is an option to follow other people, but we just can't communicate with them."
duolingo,4,7,it sucks.
duolingo,4,7,and the shop should be upgrade.
duolingo,4,7,there's nothing except for a few attire and streak freeze.
duolingo,4,7,i've got tons of lights but nothing to do with it.
duolingo,4,7,maybe have some themes that we can buy on the shop or small extra facilities.
duolingo,4,0,doesn't completely replace traditional instruction but does a good job.
duolingo,4,0,"root voices for spoken french, japanese, and german makes it difficult to know if pronunciation accurate but is a relatively ok stand-in for humans speaking."
duolingo,4,0,grammar lessons would be a very welcome addition.
duolingo,4,0,this pp was great.
duolingo,4,0,actually it would be great if it didn't have the problems that it has now
duolingo,4,0,"so, would domingo solve this problem?"
duolingo,4,1,i love using domingo on my andros phone.
duolingo,4,1,"however, when listening to specify on headphones on my way to work and doing domingo lessons at the same time, the volume of the music is always turned down for a few seconds every time something is said in domingo."
duolingo,4,1,this is extremely annoying!
duolingo,4,1,"can you please, instead of only giving us the option to mute sound effects, also implement an option to completely turn off all in-pp sounds?"
duolingo,4,1,this would be very much appreciated!
duolingo,4,1,cheers
duolingo,4,0,mostly good.
duolingo,4,0,sometimes the english is too americanised for me to get the correct answer as the up english answer is marked as wrong.
duolingo,4,0,i love do and for the most part it has been a good learning experience.
duolingo,4,0,for a while i did not have the facility to speak to do but this seems to have been .resolved.
duolingo,4,0,on a few occasions i had the correct answer but was told that it was wrong.
duolingo,4,0,apart from that all has been good and i have already recommended do to other people.
duolingo,4,1,the pp is great yet the developer force you to learn a new language in the most difficult-way-possible.
duolingo,4,1,translating from end to sea and then back!
duolingo,4,1,"sorry, you learn by immersion, ""no translating allowed!"""
duolingo,4,1,"you first learn to ""think"" in spanish; then ""speak"" in spanish and, finally, you ""type"" in spanish."
duolingo,4,1,"no one thinks in english when tying or speaking in spanish, that's just not done."
duolingo,4,1,"when speaking any language spanish/english, you ""think"" in that language so no mistakes are made."
duolingo,4,2,the pp is wonderful.
duolingo,4,2,the teaching method is quite good and the steps and images are good.
duolingo,4,2,there is both writing and speaking system and it helped me a lot.
duolingo,4,2,but i don't like one thing is that it has less health or lives option.
duolingo,4,2,"please increase it, that will be a great help."
duolingo,4,2,but overall a great pp..
duolingo,4,2,"just a quick heads up: for most languages, this should not be your only learning resource (can say for certain for cap and organ, haven't tried any other languages yet)."
duolingo,4,2,"it's a perfectly good tool, but it cannot teach you grammar, santa, or general faster ways to learn that alternative resources, like an actual teacher, can."
duolingo,4,2,"if you really want to learn a language, you'll very likely need a bit more than just this."
duolingo,4,2,"also, the spasm to my email is a bit annoying but that's easy to fix hata."
duolingo,4,0,a fun way to learn another language if you are going to be using it for basic everyday use.
duolingo,4,0,"it works really well for me because i like to immense myself in as many words, without rousing too much on the detailed rules of languages."
duolingo,4,0,800 words in 3 weeks.
duolingo,4,0,be careful not to to try the trial version for free because you can't find a way to cancel the subscription if you are not sure that you will want to use it.
duolingo,4,0,i like the format overall and the free version doesn't flood you with as.
duolingo,4,0,a helpful tool to learn the basis and grow in the language you choose to know.
duolingo,4,2,a fantastic pp to learn a new language.
duolingo,4,2,"some pronunciation are wrong, but i can live with it only because i can read arabic characters, the language i am learning being arabic of course."
duolingo,4,2,"for others, who are completely new to arabic alphabet, it might be a bit of a disadvantage."
duolingo,4,2,"i would still recommend the pp, it's free after all :)"
duolingo,4,29,it's a wonderful application.
duolingo,4,29,"however, there are some minor changes i would like to see: 1. please make it harder to pass the test (i have never failed once) 2. please add drawing characters in different languages (not just choosing) otherwise, it's a wonderful free application with only a 2-second ad at the end of each lesson."
duolingo,4,9,i am an english speaker who had been studying japanese for 2 years prior to using this pp.
duolingo,4,9,"the pp is very easy to use, but i have encountered some problems."
duolingo,4,9,sometimes the sound files are broken and also if the english translation isn't exactly as the have it the answer will be marked wrong.
duolingo,4,9,i also speak german so i practice on this pp.
duolingo,4,9,the german language pp is more complete than the japanese pp.
duolingo,4,9,hopefully this will become better in the future.
duolingo,4,0,i chose this pp for espanol y it works.
duolingo,4,0,however after the first few lessons it becomes rather tedious with artificial difficulty.
duolingo,4,0,"you see, when you make a mistake it costs a heart on 5. they take oh to replenished."
duolingo,4,0,the first lessons require 10 correct correct responses to move forward.
duolingo,4,0,now that i'm in the second half it takes 20. i want to learn more concepts not repeat but i'm gazed until i complete the lessons 4 times.
duolingo,4,0,that's 80 correct responses with the same core set of new words.
duolingo,4,0,too much!
duolingo,4,0,!
duolingo,4,7,i think it's a great way to learn and the repetition is super helpful but not overbearing.
duolingo,4,7,"my only complaints are that each new topic section just throws random words at you that hopefully you can figure out what they are according to context clues without them teaching you what they are before taking hearts away for you obviously not knowing, and that you don't seem to get much conversational practice which would be the most applicable learning i would think."
duolingo,4,7,"other than that, i really like it."
duolingo,4,1,generally useful in sharpening vocabulary if you already have some knowledge of the language.
duolingo,4,1,it could be improved by adding more actual teaching nodules.
duolingo,4,1,it would also be better if they used the female voice for statements which would likely be made by a female and the male voice for sentences which seem relevant to a male.
duolingo,4,1,at the moment it seems random.
duolingo,4,1,"so far, very easy to use and in learning quickly."
duolingo,4,1,"however, the as are very annoying and you only get so many chances to get the answers right or you have to wait until the next day."
duolingo,4,1,i signed up for the free trial and its a lot better.
duolingo,4,1,"i find that there is no explanation of words before hand, you're left to figure it out on your own."
duolingo,4,1,you also have to spell correctly to complete challenges.
duolingo,4,1,its more of a bunch of quires than a relaxed learning experience.
duolingo,4,1,"but i am learning, so there's that."
duolingo,4,14,"even though improvements can still be made to certain translations, or even some of the flow of language learning (the learning curve can be too steep), it is overall really fun to use!"
duolingo,4,14,"its highly interactive, hence it encourages continued usage, which helps in picking up a new language, even if not the most efficient (can be improved!)"
duolingo,4,14,it would be nice to have a dark mode or the likes of it to aid usage in dark areas.
duolingo,4,7,great pp.
duolingo,4,7,i use it to learn french.
duolingo,4,7,"as an english speaker, i find that it misses out on some of the possible range of answers when translating from english to french."
duolingo,4,7,"for example, 'green parts' could be either singular or plural."
duolingo,4,7,"however, the pp fails to accept the plural translation as correct."
duolingo,4,7,there are a few other examples.
duolingo,4,7,please review and update.
duolingo,4,7,great pp... but some irritating bags meaning you can't complete some lessons on the phone.
duolingo,4,7,certainly in the french (from english.
duolingo,4,7,end of section 2 and section 5 at level 2. some exercises involve placing correct words in the spaces of a statement.
duolingo,4,7,but the text fills the phone screen and the answers are out of sight and cannot be placed.
duolingo,4,7,no stroll.
duolingo,4,7,must quit the lesson and do later on a computer.
duolingo,4,7,generally the pp is great.
duolingo,4,0,very helpful and the pp makes it fun to learn.
duolingo,4,0,you can learn at your own pace.
duolingo,4,0,only thing i would change is for more content from previous lessons be integrated throughout later lessons.
duolingo,4,0,overall great program and i am thankful it is available.
duolingo,4,0,"excellent pp, great for learning a language while having fun doing it."
duolingo,4,0,i love the the pp as it feels like a game rather a real study!
duolingo,4,0,"however they claim they have a lot of rare languages but lithuania, latvia or esthonia is not there for example."
duolingo,4,0,domingo is wonderful.
duolingo,4,0,i really think people should learn at their own pace and this pp not only help you achieve that it also makes it fun and competitive.
duolingo,4,0,amazing....only used it for a few weeks and already feel so much better at speaking the language
duolingo,4,0,love it so far minus a pitch where my gems were used and didn't get my hearts filled but other that it's a fun pp.
duolingo,4,4,this is a very good pp for learning different languages.
duolingo,4,4,it has many different languages to choose from.
duolingo,4,4,"i rate this four stars instead of five because although it's very helpful, most of the sentences they teach you, you wouldn't need to know or they are things that you wouldn't normally say."
duolingo,4,4,"i think they should teach you basic sentences that you would use everyday rather than something like ""lots of young men live in america"" or something similar to that."
duolingo,4,1,this pp is great for learning new language and i am using it for months.
duolingo,4,1,after new update one thing that i don't like is that they removed pronunciation learning part... it was great... it helped a lot in making me correct for every incorrect pronunciation and boost my confidence... request domingo team to bring it back... speaking a new language is tough as compared to reading and understanding
duolingo,4,5,"i think this is wonderful, although, when i signed up for the plus expansion, i was suggested it will cost around £7/month, which is great, no strings attached, i've signed up, and i think it's a horribly cheeks move to debit my account for a full year's subscription up front, straight before christmas."
duolingo,4,5,"yeah, thanks for that."
duolingo,4,1,the best language pp have come across.
duolingo,4,1,the tests and everything just makes you better and better everyday.
duolingo,4,0,domingo does practicing a language very well.
duolingo,4,0,the flash card style makes memorization easy.
duolingo,4,0,my issue is because the style does not get into grammar you don't know why you conjugal or change forms of words in other languages.
duolingo,4,0,i love languages and have learned pieces to talk with friends as well as formally study both makarin and german.
duolingo,4,0,"i am planning a trip to japan and wanted to pick up a small bit of familiarity, but the japanese language is too complex for the simpler style do uses."
duolingo,4,2,i have enjoyed the program despite it being too slow to introduce new vocabulary.
duolingo,4,2,i like the choice of two radically different native speakers.
duolingo,4,2,it has made me step back and just listen and my accuracy in tying what is said has greatly improved.
duolingo,4,2,by jumping around i have managed to keep it interesting while working through the extensive repetition.
duolingo,4,6,"i love this, i've already learned a lot and i just started today - the only thing that takes away from the 5 star rating, is that i would like it if there was an option to just practice speaking some phrases, instead of all the other stuff too - don't get me wrong, i want that too, but practicing just the speaking with the pp telling you where it's wrong should be an extra option."
duolingo,4,1,"i've only been using the pp for approximately five days, but i really enjoy the fact that you can work at your own pace."
duolingo,4,1,"it provides a lot of practice, even giving you more advanced practice in order to gain lost lives (i sometimes lose lives on purpose so that i can do the extra practices)."
duolingo,4,1,my only pitch (and thus the four stars) is i wish it would connect you with individuals that know the language and are trying to learn your massive language so that you could help each other.
duolingo,4,0,"excellent way to learn with listening, writing, and speaking a new language !"
duolingo,4,0,very good content and structure..but you have to be connected to the internet.overall very good pp
duolingo,4,4,do lingo as a service is a great experience.
duolingo,4,4,"the pp, however is a bit limited for my taste, despite being my preferred platform for learning."
duolingo,4,4,"first, i would really like to be able to search for friends and follow them."
duolingo,4,4,"second, i feel like removing/resecting courses should also be possible."
duolingo,4,4,"third, not all items are shown in the pp's store."
duolingo,4,4,"currently i need to start up a lawton to fully utilize do lingo, even though the learning experience is more polished in the pp."
duolingo,4,0,"great language pp, especially for free."
duolingo,4,0,"my only complaint is the notion of ""health bars"" which is antithetical to the learning experience."
duolingo,4,0,"if you're too afraid of getting something wrong, you may stop trying; especially when it forces you to stop after you run out of health."
duolingo,4,0,domingo is a very good pp.
duolingo,4,0,in fact it's so easy to use and you can use it daytime and anywhere you want.
duolingo,4,0,however you can't write in organ.
duolingo,4,0,you can only write in english or choose between alternative words in organ.
duolingo,4,0,this fact makes you remember the translation instead of remembering to organ spelling.
duolingo,4,1,this pp is amazing!
duolingo,4,1,i love everything about!
duolingo,4,1,"i'm currently trying to speak french and organ, and so far i'm doing good in french!"
duolingo,4,1,"besides my journey, there is one thing bother me and it is the hearts."
duolingo,4,1,it would be a lot more fun if i didn't have to wait four hours for at least one heart.
duolingo,4,1,i'd like to study any time without having to wait.
duolingo,4,1,"so far, good job!"
duolingo,4,1,it requires your effort to learn properly.
duolingo,4,1,"you need to do lots of practices, and spend more than 5-10 minutes a day or you won't learn much !"
duolingo,4,1,would be great if it had a speaking only option and a written option as i feel speaking it is more important than reading mostly.
duolingo,4,1,"but it's a good pp, functional, and with more effort i feel i could learn well !"
duolingo,4,0,i do not like the new feature where you are forced to brush up on your skill.
duolingo,4,0,it forces you to fix 3 previously completed lessons and now i have no time to work on new ones.
duolingo,4,0,i do not want to lose my progress but don't want to be forced into more lessons when i am busy.. i hate that feature.
duolingo,4,0,wish i could get rid if it.
duolingo,4,2,great pp.
duolingo,4,2,great variety of languages.
duolingo,4,2,"one drawback for me is, (in italian) the lessons aren't comprehensive."
duolingo,4,2,"three or four verbs are introduced (sometimes without all the conjugates, which makes irregular verbs difficult), but the exercises will ask for dozens of verbs that weren't introduced."
duolingo,4,2,"while it's a great pp (and i use it enough to use the paid version), i still need a notebook to write down and learn verbs with all their conjugates, along with all the glances of the language."
duolingo,4,2,honestly i wish it would keep sending me modifications until i actually turn them off.
duolingo,4,2,"like, i know it's annoying to some people, but you could just turn off the modifications if your truly anna quit."
duolingo,4,2,"for me, personally, sometimes i actually need to be annoyed into doing it."
duolingo,4,2,"if the pp keeps pestering me, eventually i'll give in and do a lesson or two."
duolingo,4,2,and that's the goal.
duolingo,4,2,to learn a language.
duolingo,4,0,great pp for casual to serious language learning.
duolingo,4,0,"resources vary depending on demand of language, so less popular languages won't be as resourceful as a spanish or french."
duolingo,4,0,overall a good pp.
duolingo,4,0,i'd recommend to any one.
duolingo,4,0,p.s.
duolingo,4,0,i hate that you guns took out the conversation practice section.
duolingo,4,0,and also add haitian role!!!!!
duolingo,4,0,!
duolingo,4,0,helpful but needs more improvement.
duolingo,4,0,i've taken a course in hind.
duolingo,4,0,the pronunciation of some different letters are the same.
duolingo,4,0,"for example, c is the same as cut and tu is the same as to."
duolingo,4,0,i request the developer to look into this problem and fix it sap.
duolingo,4,0,thank you :)
duolingo,4,0,great way to develop you linguistic skill.
duolingo,4,0,"serious or not, just a really fun way to learn a language."
duolingo,4,0,definitely a great learning tool and it plays like a game so it caps into the reward centers of the brain and keeps you coming back.
duolingo,4,0,the lessons could stand to explain certain things a little better though.
duolingo,4,0,like each lesson should have a little into that lays out what will be covered.
duolingo,4,6,"would give it five stars if it was cheaper to purchase the full pp, it's a really fantastic tool."
duolingo,4,6,"after a few weeks i already know basic phrases and words, and it's easy to do half an hour each day to keep progressing, i can already see how far i've come."
duolingo,4,6,"plus, i'm finally ticking that bucket list item of learning french."
duolingo,4,6,merci beaucoup!
duolingo,4,0,pretty good but probably intended to supplement a class.
duolingo,4,0,the rules of the french language (the one i'm trying to learn) aren't really explained in the pp but i'm still able to learn short sentences.
duolingo,4,0,i like that the lessons are brief and have lots of repetition.
duolingo,4,0,it's a good pp overall.
duolingo,4,2,been using this for chinese.
duolingo,4,2,it's essentially a flashcard system.
duolingo,4,2,"you are given example sentences, then the idea is overcome you get more intuitively intense to how simple-intermediate sentences are constructed in that target language."
duolingo,4,2,the fact it is free is awesome.
duolingo,4,2,i feel like you can definitely get at least a good foundation.
duolingo,4,2,but.
duolingo,4,2,don't just use domingo.
duolingo,4,2,"you should use this in addition to a book, or other apes for example."
duolingo,4,2,you should also expose yourself to more audit.
duolingo,4,0,mostly positive but the points system needs work.
duolingo,4,0,essentially if you want to use the pp as intended then you find yourself at a disadvantage compared to people who just spasm the same lesson (stories) for points to win first on the leaderboards.
duolingo,4,0,"not that it matters, but for me it took the joy out of the competition aspect which is a big driver for me to use the pp more."
duolingo,4,0,this could easily be fixed by either only rewarding new lessons or rewarding each lesson once per week.
duolingo,4,0,excellent pp for chinese.
duolingo,4,0,"if the pp was $4.00/month, i'd buy, but it is too expensive."
duolingo,4,0,"the interface requires too many click, with a ""continue"" click after every answer."
duolingo,4,0,"better that the pp display a momentary pass or fail, then continue automatically."
duolingo,4,0,the pp present work in landscape orientation.
duolingo,4,0,"it is very useful to learn a great amount of languages, its mechanism of teaching are so helpful"
duolingo,4,1,i would like it much better if there is an option to turn the writing portion of the language you are trying to learn off.
duolingo,4,1,"because some people don't want to write to someone, or something like that."
duolingo,4,1,"but, domingo is great in all other ways."
duolingo,4,1,"however, it is staying 4 ✴ until it is added."
duolingo,4,1,and i really wanted to give this pp 5 ✴.
duolingo,4,0,i'm doing chinese course in this pp.
duolingo,4,0,"i like the competitive element, helps to do exercise every day."
duolingo,4,0,"still, i'm become bit bored with repetition mode of learning."
duolingo,4,0,"exercises should be more varied, a fast vocabulary mode added, writing added and so on."
duolingo,4,0,"also, the paid option is too costly."
duolingo,4,0,i could spend £5 a month but no more.
duolingo,4,0,can only rate the free version.
duolingo,4,0,"seems to be too easy,especially when you're learning a language that you can already speak pretty well, even after taking the offered self evaluation test at the beginning."
duolingo,4,0,hence only four stars.
duolingo,4,0,i enjoy using this multi-language learning pp.
duolingo,4,0,"it is easy to navigable, and has an upgrade, for serious language earners."
duolingo,4,0,at the basic level it provides introductory language skill and assessment.
duolingo,4,0,i enjoy practicing survival skill needed for travel.
duolingo,4,0,it is a carefully thought out application.
duolingo,4,0,pretty good pp.
duolingo,4,0,very useful.
duolingo,4,0,just needs more words in every category possible :) thanks
duolingo,4,0,i noticed that you don't learn the alphabet yet.
duolingo,4,0,four stars but overall the pp is great.
duolingo,4,0,so far i've really enjoyed learning with domingo.
duolingo,4,0,it feels slow paced as i expand my french vocabulary.
duolingo,4,0,however i am learning the fundamentals of sentence and word construction.
duolingo,4,0,the syllabus is the best i've experienced with any language learning application i've tried.
duolingo,4,0,i don't recommend only using domingo though.
duolingo,4,0,you should supplement with outside sources to learn how natives actually speak.
duolingo,4,0,it has nice started lessons.
duolingo,4,0,very much interactive and helps with pronunciation.
duolingo,4,0,it's fun and nicely rewarding for children.
duolingo,4,0,i am unable to give my child access to use the school tablets though and can't find how to correct this.
duolingo,4,0,"the pp is good (it helped me a lot when i studied german), except for the domingo+ as (they are quite annoying)"
duolingo,4,0,"i love the pp, i just wish there would be pictures attached to words for better absorption!"
duolingo,4,0,editing my review because after updated i have seen great improvement with the pp.
duolingo,4,0,but now i am very disappointed in the lack of lessons.
duolingo,4,0,you would get up to 20 lessons at the higher levels which is good for retention as repetition is key but now you only get 4 for each level and that is ridiculous.
duolingo,4,0,loving it so far.
duolingo,4,0,"request: every lesson word prefilled and put as ""drill"" (ak flashcards within pp) next to ""practice"" when lesson is complete."
duolingo,4,0,what kid ever learned to count by learning numbers random?
duolingo,4,0,thank you for letting us *slow down* a phrase.
duolingo,4,0,very necessary!!
duolingo,4,0,"second request: ""survival"" words much sooner please!"
duolingo,4,0,"push back ""he eats banana"" in favor of ""where is the toilet?"""
duolingo,4,0,hello.
duolingo,4,0,goodby.
duolingo,4,0,i'm hungry.
duolingo,4,0,i want water to drink.
duolingo,4,0,etc etc.
duolingo,4,0,the pp is working well and i appreciate the reminders.
duolingo,4,0,i occasionally need to be ragged.
duolingo,4,0,i also appreciate that you can slow the speaking down so you can better hear and understand the pronunciation.
duolingo,4,0,my only complaint is that i missed a good bit of time while moving and really wanted to start over from scratch and couldn't find a way to do so.
duolingo,4,0,the user should have more control over whether they want to do any lesson over from the beginning.
duolingo,4,0,"good pp, but i think that one change that can be made is warning the users when we're going to advance to the next leaderboard."
duolingo,4,0,i think it'd be useful and motivation :) sometimes it can be frustration to end up in with place hata
duolingo,4,0,daily reminder / learning the basis is most important.
duolingo,4,0,free and simple to use.
duolingo,4,0,"perfect pp for learning new languages, it's a shame you need to pay to use it office the."
duolingo,4,1,"ok, this pp is a great free language-learning pp, but i just feel like it doesn teach you correctly sometimes in the exercises, and it doesn't give you too many tips during the lesson either."
duolingo,4,1,"overall a good pp, it's just a bit hard to get used to."
duolingo,4,1,hopefully i can learn better the more i use it though.
duolingo,4,1,"great pp for learning languages with minimal as, definitely worth downloading!"
duolingo,4,1,i feel courses should use some of the more advanced words from previous courses to make longer and more challenging sentences.
duolingo,4,1,i know its a lot to ask for free education but i feel it would help a lot of people that use the pp
duolingo,4,5,"domingo is fun and educational, something that a bit more difficult to see... and the domingo bird hasn tried to kill me yet so that a plus!"
duolingo,4,5,"but honestly, this game is fun and educational and easy to do anywhere."
duolingo,4,5,"my only criticism would be that you should have a bit more life, maybe eight?"
duolingo,4,5,"cause some levels are pretty difficult and having more health-even just such a small amount-would be very useful, or i could just be bad."
duolingo,4,5,overall great game!
duolingo,4,0,great pp for developing a new language skill.
duolingo,4,0,i rate it 4/5 because it doesn't have the dragon language from syria.
duolingo,4,3,pretty good.
duolingo,4,3,"there are as now, but in an acceptable quantity."
duolingo,4,3,stories work now too.
duolingo,4,3,"one weird thing is that if you have plus and you activate download in a device, it decides to download on all your devices (such as a tablet/phone comb)!"
duolingo,4,3,this is pretty bad if you have limited space in one of them.
duolingo,4,0,i am learning french through english.
duolingo,4,0,it's a brilliant pp.
duolingo,4,0,i liked it.
duolingo,4,0,but please have some updated in the pp: i) number of words learnt are shown.
duolingo,4,0,please update a menu to show the lists of the words learnt so that we can revise it later.
duolingo,4,0,ii) why can't we search the friends/people by name?
duolingo,4,0,there is no searching friends option.
duolingo,4,0,iii) it would be better if you allowed us to practice the exercise of checkpoints.
duolingo,4,0,please let us to review checkpoint exercises.
duolingo,4,0,hope to hear from you soon.
duolingo,4,0,thank you.
duolingo,4,4,this is a really helpful pp.
duolingo,4,4,i've learned so much already since i started using it.
duolingo,4,4,but it can be very frustration in the way that some of the features work.
duolingo,4,4,so if you have the patience and willing to dig for some answers when it marks you wrong (even though 90% of the comments from other users on the pp show that your answer was the same as theirs) you might really enjoy this pp.
duolingo,4,0,i love it.
duolingo,4,0,i can't believe how much i am learning.
duolingo,4,0,"i wish the lesson would explain a little more, but the community is so friendly and willing to teach it makes up for the lack of content in the lessons."
duolingo,4,0,plus it is free.
duolingo,4,0,i'm using a free version and it's pretty good considering it's free.
duolingo,4,0,i'm i upgrade that one day.
duolingo,4,0,"for being absolutely free, this is the best pp out here."
duolingo,4,0,it's not going to teach you everything but you'll definitely get a good grasp of whatever language you want to learn.
duolingo,4,0,my only grip is that the speaking activities don't work.
duolingo,4,0,i tap the record button and it automatically tells me it's incorrect without giving me the opportunity to speak.
duolingo,4,0,i just turn it off but i'd like to use it.
duolingo,4,0,thanks do team!
duolingo,4,0,"excellent pp, been using on and off to improve language skill i let fall to the wayside after school."
duolingo,4,0,i have noticed one or two errors here and there but overall i find domingo very accurate and it's a really excellent tool to brush up on a language or to start learning a new one.
duolingo,4,0,"i really love the pp except for one piece, the health."
duolingo,4,0,"i get they are trying to push the premium service, but the webster doesn't employ this feature and i can learn all day."
duolingo,4,0,but if you get into a lesson you struggle with on the pp your health can run out before even completely finishing a single lesson.
duolingo,4,13,"while i understand & appreciate the necessary repetition method, i would like to see a much larger vocabulary of words to learn."
duolingo,4,13,ex.
duolingo,4,13,: it only reaches counting to 3!
duolingo,4,13,why not more - like up to 100 at least?
duolingo,4,13,"or words like ”l'm lost"", ""it's cold in here”, ”i need help with ..."", animal names, aunt's, uncle's, etc."
duolingo,4,13,please increase vocabulary content in every category!
duolingo,4,0,very good pp.
duolingo,4,0,could be more verbal interaction from the user in answering questions
duolingo,4,4,"in definitely makes learning a language more fun alright, especially when there are some interesting phrases you'd never use dotted here and there... mixed feelings about the update with limited lives, but i really like the addition of those stories, helps reinforce what you've learned in context."
duolingo,4,4,of course it shouldn't be used as a sole learning tool but overall really good pp.
duolingo,4,0,i really enjoy domingo but what i don't like with this new update are the hearts.
duolingo,4,0,it doesn't allow for error and it's not fair.
duolingo,4,0,i get that it may make people more determined to get the correct answer but it's not fair.
duolingo,4,0,mistakes happen and learning a second language is hard.
duolingo,4,0,i know it's also trying to get people to buy plus but even then it's not fair.
duolingo,4,0,it's a good pp but the hearts suck.
duolingo,4,0,great so far!
duolingo,4,0,started using domingo to learn organ a week ago.
duolingo,4,0,"the beginner lessons are clear and simple, and the pp provides lots of encouragement!"
duolingo,4,0,"only complaint is that similar sounds are taught together, which makes me confuse them all with each other at first."
duolingo,4,1,a great starting learning tool if you lack the proper time or schedule to take classes.
duolingo,4,1,the reason i don't give it 5 stars is because grammar rules aren't explained
duolingo,4,1,"in the scottish garlic, for example, the mention rules aren't explained properly."
duolingo,4,1,"so new earners with scratch their heads in confusion as to why ""boy"" is spelled as ""black"" but in other phrases and exercises as ""bhallaic""."
duolingo,4,1,this may also apply to languages with declensions.
duolingo,4,0,"it's nice it has so many languages, but would it be possible to include as (american sign language) into the choice as well?"
duolingo,4,0,when i switch to split view the answers are get auto picked.... it climate choice and directly display answer before i mentally pick the answer.
duolingo,4,3,pretty good for learning vocabulary.
duolingo,4,3,"the incentive to practise leagues regularly are mostly positive, except for the 'leagues' feature."
duolingo,4,3,can run a bit slowly on my phone.
duolingo,4,3,doesn't use that much data or space (unless you have plus and download courses).
duolingo,4,3,"the occasional bug making lessons impassable, very rare, i've only seen them in practise mode"
duolingo,4,0,"ok so it's a good pp but......its just it says free but when run out of hearts it says you can be plus and get unlimited hearts when i pushed it, it said it wanted money it kind made me mad but i still love the pp so much maybe fix that problem thank you!!!!!!"
duolingo,4,0,!
duolingo,4,0,i've learnt a lot of french words and phases.
duolingo,4,0,not sure it's enough without conversing but like all things the amount of time & practice you put in counts.
duolingo,4,0,it is a free pp with minimum ad disruption and gives lots of incentive due to league tables & prompt ~ what's not to like!
duolingo,4,5,"domingo is a very good program, friendly to use, especially for free."
duolingo,4,5,"i love that it crowd-sources to improve the sentences and answers, and i relish the opportunity to contribute to this community."
duolingo,4,5,"however, i do find it a bit distressing that when i get my language trees all polished, i get knocked back almost to zero, with alarming frequency."
duolingo,4,5,"it has really hampered my ability to cover new material and enhance my learning, esp."
duolingo,4,5,in languages where i have extensive outside experience.
duolingo,4,0,it seems a good way to learn some of a language.
duolingo,4,0,"early days yet, but i am enjoying it."
duolingo,4,0,it is well thought out.
duolingo,4,0,domingo has been great!
duolingo,4,0,it is an easy way to learn a language while at the same time it is fun and exciting.
duolingo,4,0,:)
duolingo,4,4,great pp.
duolingo,4,4,i love learning languages.
duolingo,4,4,i will probably just keep learning more languages and languages for ever.
duolingo,4,4,i would have given at 5 stars but there are too many things to click when you are done your lesson.
duolingo,4,4,"you should be able to click one button, see one ad and move on."
duolingo,4,4,i don't want to click four times to get to the next lesson
duolingo,4,1,"great application, lot of languages to learn / practise."
duolingo,4,1,a few translation fails but this is clearly not the reason i removed a star.
duolingo,4,1,the main culprit of the pp : it lacks of courses to explain things (except for french).
duolingo,4,1,haven't tried the paid version though.
duolingo,4,1,nonetheless great job from the des !
duolingo,4,3,great pp and amazing when studying a new language from basis.
duolingo,4,3,"i have an improvement idea regarding to the sentences, that there would be a chance to copy paste inside the pp, or at least have ""my list"" and collect interesting and useful phrases there in order to study them later."
duolingo,4,3,"of course, mentally writing the sentences to a noted makes one remember better :)"
duolingo,4,4,i really enjoy it.
duolingo,4,4,good set of the gun.
duolingo,4,4,"i'd like to see support for finnish and it's a little tough because you can't ask ""why"", but it is really accessible and a great option or starting point for someone looking to learn a language."
duolingo,4,4,was learning garlic and russian.
duolingo,4,4,"would prefer if you didn't get points for your native language, it kind of news the leader board system."
duolingo,4,2,i really love using domingo.
duolingo,4,2,"it has helped greatly with my dutch, french and spanish."
duolingo,4,2,i wish they made it this fun in high school.
duolingo,4,2,"i enjoy the writing, as i have to pay attention to accents."
duolingo,4,2,the only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is that sometimes i cannot understand the native speakers clearly.
duolingo,4,2,"otherwise, it is a fantastic learning tool that i'd recommend to anyone!"
duolingo,4,0,it's great for a free pp and tries really hard to keep you motivate.
duolingo,4,0,"but the errors, the lack of some vital information while learning and the pure translation-focus of the pp takes away from the learning experience in my opinion."
duolingo,4,0,"for context, i was learning german through english."
duolingo,4,14,wonderful!
duolingo,4,14,"uses many channels to assist the learner: reading, writing, listening, speaking, humorous stories/dialogue -- in fact, a crazy sense of humor permeates much of the program, helping one to pay attention."
duolingo,4,14,"the program really is brilliant, using a motivation leaderboard system to keep you hooked in and working hard."
duolingo,4,14,and it's free!
duolingo,4,14,"i don't mind looking at the little as because i am getting so much, and for free!"
duolingo,4,0,"it has well-planned lessons that are strengthening my vocabulary, while getting me to form the bridges both ways connecting the two languages."
duolingo,4,0,"if there could be one improvement i could suggest, it would be a form of prime or dictionary that build as we learn."
duolingo,4,0,the variant between pp and brother are kind weird.
duolingo,4,0,you can find different tips pages on each of them
duolingo,4,0,it's actually pretty fun and helps for sure.
duolingo,4,0,recommend a lesson based section to help teach more but other than that it's a good memory pp
duolingo,4,0,excellent pp for learning a language!
duolingo,4,0,the slight differences between the pp and the web site knock it down a notch though.
duolingo,4,0,stories would be awesome for the phone pp!
duolingo,4,0,"it's weird that a communication pp doesn't have communication between members, which is why my rating is what it is."
duolingo,4,0,really easy to use.
duolingo,4,0,the free version comes with adds but they aren't too long and come at the end of the lessons rather that interrupting anything.
duolingo,4,0,you can choose from a wide variety of languages to learn and the lessons are entertaining and challenging enough to keep you committed.
duolingo,4,0,"excellent varied lessons in small 5-10 minute chinks, the losing lives thing when you make mistakes is very annoying though, i don't mind viewing the odd as between lessons, but having to quit on the last question then repeat the whole lesson was annoying and disrupted my learning."
duolingo,4,0,very good pp for language learning and somewhat adjective!
duolingo,4,0,would be improved by having explanations of the grammar points covered.
duolingo,4,0,i would also value a way to create profile for my children as this would be a great way to get the whole family learning together.
duolingo,4,1,actually really fun.
duolingo,4,1,a few of the finer points here and there are in need of some live and update but overall great way to learn a new language.
duolingo,4,1,i'd like to see some form of writing practice implements as well though to learn symbols of new languages such as japanese or organ.
duolingo,4,1,"very good for learning with much pictures, and it brings me lots of fun!"
duolingo,4,1,"i really love it, and it's easy to control yourself go keep doing it and it won't takes long everyday."
duolingo,4,1,"but, maybe it will be kind lots of as and makes you send some money on the better version."
duolingo,4,1,"oh whatever, it's really a good pp."
duolingo,4,1,download it!!!
duolingo,4,1,
duolingo,4,1,"learning arabic, german and french on do is fun."
duolingo,4,1,"there may be a few little flakes, but these can be discussed in the forum."
duolingo,4,1,"for becoming a client speaker, you should immense yourself in a language in different ways though."
duolingo,4,1,i hope do further develops 'stories' to help with immersion.
duolingo,4,0,"it's a really good pp but if you get something wrong, then you lose a heart."
duolingo,4,0,"and sometimes when i'm doing a speaking exercise, the microphone turns off."
duolingo,4,0,i don't know why but it's extremely annoying.
duolingo,4,0,"also if there was more languages available to learn, then this would be a great pp."
duolingo,4,0,great pp to learn perfect in all but one way... some of the owners you use has to have the accents and domingo plus is pretty much the same thing as the normal domingo so save your money and the lingouts is pretty much op but hard to get once you get enough you can buy a new look for the log and some more life's to use download it and if i cot five wrong i had to wait 3 hours for my next piece of my life so all together i had to wait 24 hours to have full lives
duolingo,4,4,this is a great pp for languages.
duolingo,4,4,"i'm in th grade, and i'm trying to learn organ."
duolingo,4,4,"the reason i took off one star is because it's a little straight forward, and when you're still learning the alphabet or something, the next thing is something you've never seen before."
duolingo,4,4,i also don't like the lives/hearts and how you have to wait to refill them.
duolingo,4,4,"other than that, i love this pp and i really recommend it."
duolingo,4,3,"using this pp is similar to playing a game, as there are rewards, unsociable content like costumes or extra ""levels"", and a leaderboards system to keep you involved."
duolingo,4,3,"more costumes and power-up would be nice, such as costumes for individual languages, like a matador for the spanish class or a nina for japanese."
duolingo,4,3,"learning with this pp is easy, and the difficulty changes to match your progress."
duolingo,4,3,my only major complaint is the lack of extra content like costumes or powers for more motivation.
duolingo,4,0,great pp.
duolingo,4,0,"i've been learning japanese with it, and have made good progress."
duolingo,4,0,"i can think of a few improvements, but overall it is a good pp to learn a new language."
duolingo,4,0,"i wouldn suggest it as your only tool, but it is a great in it's own ways."
duolingo,4,0,"overall, i like this pp."
duolingo,4,0,"it's easy to use, and is helping me learn japanese."
duolingo,4,0,"the problem that i've had is if you run out of hearts and use the gems to refill them, it takes the gems, but doesn't refill the hearts."
duolingo,4,0,"keeping the streak adds to my motivation to study, the lessons are quick but useful."
duolingo,4,0,"4 stars just because i have to be connected to the internet for a new lesson, i thought it'd be download already when you choose what language to study"
duolingo,4,0,"please, i can do audit lessons."
duolingo,4,0,he cannot start recording somehow.
duolingo,4,0,"and please, add a lesson to learn the symbols of the language, letters, anti, etc."
duolingo,4,0,great pp for learning.
duolingo,4,0,i love the gentle reminders to meet my daily goals.
duolingo,4,0,this past year was rough.
duolingo,4,0,i was without wife for much of the time.
duolingo,4,0,it was discouraging not to be able to learn office without paying.
duolingo,4,0,this is an awesome application.
duolingo,4,0,"i love it so much and it helped me a lot learning a new language but the"" hearts "" take a very long time to refill that lead me to quit the pp and i wish u would look at this matter and make it better!!"
duolingo,4,0,try for reading this comment and for making this pp and dating it ❤️❤️❤️❤️
duolingo,4,0,the reason i'm giving it a 4 is because i found differences in the teaching style depending on the language you pick.
duolingo,4,0,"for example with spanish, it goes straight to teaching you spanish words and phrases."
duolingo,4,0,"with japanese, they teach you the alphabet first and then give you a word or phrase using the alphabet you've learned."
duolingo,4,0,"just in the first phase, i've probably only learned about 20-30 words compared to the first phase of the spanish course."
duolingo,4,107,"it's a great language learning pp, whatever you will be taught, those things will stick to your mind."
duolingo,4,107,"only thing which is required in this pp according to me, is to add a feature of essaying with other earners."
duolingo,4,107,it would be great if we will interact with real and normal peoples around the globe with their native language.
duolingo,4,107,🙂 💟 peace ✌
duolingo,4,0,i recently started to study hind on domingo.
duolingo,4,0,i liked my experience so far.
duolingo,4,0,but there are problems in some of the questions.
duolingo,4,0,"for instance in letters 3 in some of the paring, two of them doesn't match."
duolingo,4,0,"although they are the correct ones, and you leave it as the last pain, they don t match and you can't move past that."
duolingo,4,0,"i tried to use lights to skin the level, but thexproblem repeated several times in different lesson and my lights finished because of that!"
duolingo,4,0,please correct the problem.
duolingo,4,0,thank to
duolingo,4,0,good pp but it also incorporated a score board which makes you forget about why you went on in the first place.
duolingo,4,0,and that is to learn.
duolingo,4,0,i nearly got sucked into it by being top of the leader board but then slowed down to a pace that was better for a good learning experience.
duolingo,4,0,it was really good until recently.
duolingo,4,0,"lately there are features that don't work, either not on the screen or not reacting."
duolingo,4,0,this is preventing me from progressing and also off-putting.
duolingo,4,0,seems to be the last few updated.
duolingo,4,1,"its a great pp, i love that it gives people of less fortunate financial status a chance to learn what previously was too expensive or difficult to do."
duolingo,4,1,"my only wish is that they'd make segments for certain languages which use photographs, which would teach you the meanings and stroke order (i.e chinese, japanese)."
duolingo,4,0,very straight forward and easy to use.
duolingo,4,0,"the whole theme is a bit childish, seems to be aimed at pre tens or something."
duolingo,4,0,but the content itself and repetition help to memories the lessons easier.
duolingo,4,0,"most of the pp is free and adds are reasonable, not too invasion or constant."
duolingo,4,0,the whole not system is a bit useless but i guess the aim is education and not in pp rewards.
duolingo,4,0,"the academic side is very good, the way lessons are presented make their content understandable, a general good pp!"
duolingo,4,0,i appreciate having an pp that actually helps me learn spanish.
duolingo,4,0,it is a blessing that it is free.
duolingo,4,0,the as are few and not too annoying.
duolingo,4,0,"i wish the progress was faster, but the pace seems related to my demonstrated proficient."
duolingo,4,0,"if so, then the slow pace is on me."
duolingo,4,1,it's a fun way to practice spanish for me.
duolingo,4,1,"i have a basic knowledge of spanish, but am far from conversational."
duolingo,4,1,"do offered a placement test, but still seems to have started me at a very elementary level, so it's not challenging me so far, but still good reminders of where accent marks are needed in writing and has me using spanish for fun"
duolingo,4,0,"love this pp, but there is a tiny bug.. i came first in one of the leagues, but the reward gems never actually got added."
duolingo,4,0,"also if i watch an add to ""double the reward"" it never adds any extra."
duolingo,4,0,"not a big thing, but it is a pitch."
duolingo,4,0,thanks anyway for a great pp.
duolingo,4,1,domingo enables me to extensively practise polish.
duolingo,4,1,both in reading and in writing.
duolingo,4,1,"it is a good tool to practise speaking as well, however that is completely up to you, not required by the pp nor checked by the pp."
duolingo,4,1,the only thing missing is some explanation of theory.
duolingo,4,1,for that purpose i bought a book.
duolingo,4,1,it's an excellent learning tool and you learn way faster than a class room setting.
duolingo,4,1,to top it off its actually fun.. all in all i would give it five but the rob voice can make hard to hear proper pronunciation .
duolingo,4,1,if you could use actual human voice i would definitely be giving a five star rating for domingo.... i still would recommend domingo to anyone that wants to learn a second language.... thank you and keep up the excellent work domingo..
duolingo,4,0,this pp i really enjoy but when it gets into the sentences it doesn't describe how they work for example why is not is at the end of a sentence and the sentence being divided so you can tell apart each individual word instead of guessing all the little details an i've tried to look it up on goose translate but i only get similar writings i want to look up answers and i'd also like to know if i'm learning north or south organ that might be crucial in who i talk with in the future
duolingo,4,0,"love this pp, it's very useful for learning all types of different languages, it's very useful because i am using it for school, i just wish you didn't have to pay to get more unlimited hearts, or just make it so you have more hearts, beside that it's a great pp."
duolingo,4,0,"this is a really cool and efficient learning pp and i like it, but i have 2 problems; firstly, you learn a very formal version of the language (e.g ""to teno"" or unnecessary ""-of's""): secondly, the audit on latin is kind weird, like it isn't professionally done."
duolingo,4,0,amazing pp the.
duolingo,4,0,would recommend.
duolingo,4,0,:))))
duolingo,4,0,good way to learn the basis.
duolingo,4,0,it can even listen and rate your pronunciation.
duolingo,4,0,that part doesn't work so well in noisy environment like computer trains.
duolingo,4,0,one knock on is that one of the focus areas is on animals rather than grocer shopping vocabulary or something more useful.
duolingo,4,0,great pp!
duolingo,4,0,"i've been learning chinese and it's going well, i wouldn't have the opportunity to learn the language so easily without domingo."
duolingo,4,0,the as and modifications are also kept to a minimum.
duolingo,4,0,"the only thing is that audit sometimes doesn't work or isn't available, which can be quite annoying."
duolingo,4,1,this pp is very helpful.
duolingo,4,1,the learning pace is fast.
duolingo,4,1,"however, there are stitches in software that make images hard to see occasionally."
duolingo,4,1,this pp is very interactive and has interactive pitch but other than a few minor things it is still easy to use.
duolingo,4,0,nice pp but when i add hind to english language.
duolingo,4,0,the pp language sets hind but i need pp content in english and internal quit in hind and english.
duolingo,4,1,"i like this pp, not necessarily love it though."
duolingo,4,1,my first language is russian but i am client in both russian and english.
duolingo,4,1,"i was seeing how russian was on the pp to see if it was worth it for my husband to use it, and it's very simple and not helpful at all in everyday life."
duolingo,4,1,we will try to learn french for the next month or two so that we aren't completely lost in montreal 😂
duolingo,4,0,nice pp.
duolingo,4,0,remark: sometimes the words to learn are much repetition than needed.
duolingo,4,0,i have really enjoyed learning german.
duolingo,4,0,its a lot of fun!
duolingo,4,0,but i dont really understand how the program works in: i was trying to find a section which outlines how you progress through each level and what all the awards/symbols mean.
duolingo,4,0,so i just much my way through it really.
duolingo,4,1,the pp itself is amazing.
duolingo,4,1,"i download it to learn finnish, but i couldn't find it, that's why i'm a bit disappointed."
duolingo,4,1,"if you are looking to learn other languages then finnish, then i'd recommend this pp to you, so far i had no problems what so ever."
duolingo,4,1,please add finnish though.
duolingo,4,1,thank you!
duolingo,4,1,(◍•ᴗ•◍)
duolingo,4,0,"hi, i just updated to the pro version, but i'm having trouble with my russian lessons, because i can not listen to the right pronouncement of the words, when i click the button to here it, nothing happens."
duolingo,4,0,can someone help me?
duolingo,4,0,thanks a lot :)
duolingo,4,0,lovely pp but at the end of when you finished all the parts or then since it doesn't exactly say how to pronounce words i think there's should be a whole part about it or least under death the word write the who to pronounce it but either way lovely pp good job guns!
duolingo,4,0,i'm enjoying russian.
duolingo,4,1,"has helped me for sure, but small criticism would be that it is overlay repetition."
duolingo,4,1,"repetition bread familiarity, but i feel it can be too repeititve."
duolingo,4,1,perhaps an algorithm to measure how many times you got something right or wrong could be used to progress quick earners more quickly?
duolingo,4,0,this a really fun pp.
duolingo,4,0,it is not a game pp.
duolingo,4,0,it is where you get to learn different languages.
duolingo,4,0,when you get the pp you have to make yourself an account.
duolingo,4,0,then you can pick any language you want to learn.
duolingo,4,0,you can learn more than one language.
duolingo,4,0,last step before you can start learning the new language is you have to say if you are a beginner or advance for the language that you pick.
duolingo,4,0,it is good for people that normally speak a different language and they want to learn english.
duolingo,4,0,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
duolingo,4,1,this pp is real fun!
duolingo,4,1,"i appreciate that i'm able to track my progress to some degree, it encouraging and motivation."
duolingo,4,1,"also all these idiot and mormons saying that if they lose all their hearts they have to wait... first of all don't suck, second of all if you go back and do courses you've already completed they give you a free heart with the option to double it if you watch a 30 second ad."
duolingo,4,1,stop complaining/ making excuses and figure it out.
duolingo,4,1,"domingo you guns are awesome, keep it up."
duolingo,4,0,"loved the pp, the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that there is a bug in the story section of german where even after passing it and clinking on continue, it sometimes doesn't proceed to give the was."
duolingo,4,0,it just freeze.
duolingo,4,1,domingo is a good pp to use if you are interested in learning languages.
duolingo,4,1,just sometimes it don't save your lessons when you do one.
duolingo,4,1,recommend this pp😁lessons are interesting and fun especially for kiss.
duolingo,4,1,improve on the amount of hearts.
duolingo,4,1,when u get your reward(diamonds) it may say watch an ad to open another chest to double your reward but after the amount stays the same.
duolingo,4,1,watched ad for nothing 😪😢
duolingo,4,0,i really like the pp.
duolingo,4,0,it uses various repetition to learn the language.
duolingo,4,0,i wish it had some lessons such as explanations of why something is spoken a certain way especially for phrases that are not standard but overall a great pp!
duolingo,4,0,i find the lights difficult to understand... can one opt out of the competitive side with others & just compete with oneself?
duolingo,4,0,it is demoralizing to keep going to zero points & then having to beat others.
duolingo,4,0,it is not cooperative.
duolingo,4,0,otherwise i find it an excellent pp.
duolingo,4,0,"quite well structures, but you need to know the basic before you start."
duolingo,4,0,"the pp does not in itself teach you, it just provides a platform for you to teach yourself."
duolingo,4,0,some mistakes in the greek module and it is not always consistent in the exact response it expects.
duolingo,4,0,it's had little law.
duolingo,4,0,"like some words aren't fully pronounce, it pronounced like 1/2 of the words"
duolingo,4,0,"superb but try to avoid repeating the same sentences in the same lesson several times, it becomes very boring in fact, try to use the words you want me to learn in different sentences to avoid making anyone feel boring, and one more thing, each lesson have many levels, try to make each level is especial and make me feel that i learned new thing even a new sentence"
duolingo,4,1,after the update.
duolingo,4,1,"the pp is working properly, even though the internet is available , after opening the pp and clinking on a level it shows internet is not available."
duolingo,4,1,the course sometime starts but mostly doesn't.
duolingo,4,0,it was good the downside is it giving me alert to learn the language i anna learn at 3 am in the morning and i can change it.
duolingo,4,0,that's about the only part that needs to be fixed.
duolingo,4,0,so far so good.
duolingo,4,0,"i've done 2 lessons (into and phrases), and so far no kinds."
duolingo,4,0,very easy activities that change as you progress.
duolingo,4,0,"very manageable, time-wise, because the span of the daily lessons depends on the user."
duolingo,4,0,i stand so far.
duolingo,4,1,domingo is a good way to get a feel for the language and increase your vocabulary.
duolingo,4,1,it's a bit too keen on dating- often the new version isn't as good as the previous one.
duolingo,4,1,"at the moment, since an update i cannot load it onto my pad."
duolingo,4,1,very frustration.
duolingo,4,1,its worked fine for over 4 years until the last update.
duolingo,4,0,"the only issue with this program (and it's free so you really shouldn't), is that i wish they would expand the verbs."
duolingo,4,0,they've gotten better from when it first came out so that is good.
duolingo,4,0,love to practice.
duolingo,4,0,it's been over 30 years when i learned the language as an exchange student.
duolingo,4,0,easy to use pp.
duolingo,4,0,i love the daily reminder and the upgrade with stories.
duolingo,4,0,this is pp is unique.
duolingo,4,0,"it reaches you a language, for fun, for free."
duolingo,4,0,"it offers a 7-day free trial for there upgrade to plus, and you can even compete on a leader board."
duolingo,4,0,"there is one problem, though."
duolingo,4,0,i lately have gotten too much homework to complete in one night.
duolingo,4,0,so i set domingo aside... and didn't have enough gems to buy streak freeze for 4 days.
duolingo,4,0,"my 25 day streak disappeared, and the cut moscow was left crying in my into."
duolingo,4,0,"not only the moscow that didn't deserve this, but my streak, gone."
duolingo,4,0,it is a great pp.
duolingo,4,0,have tried to learn languages before.
duolingo,4,0,"only 4 stars, first because i would like latvia, second a little information behind the words would be great."
duolingo,4,0,"3 different words for are, why, i had to stop learning and go find out."
duolingo,4,0,tell me about new words and how they apply.
duolingo,4,0,"you know feminine, masculine, individual, plural, yourself, others."
duolingo,4,0,would help a lot.
duolingo,4,0,"listening to rapid speech and working with native speakers, especially with danish, is a plus."
duolingo,4,0,russian text without accent marks but with native speakers reading is another.
duolingo,4,0,"a negative is the choice of vocabulary: turtle & elephants, really!"
duolingo,4,0,"54 years ago, learning french in paris, i started with propositions and pointing words, then introduction, greetings & 'help'!"
duolingo,4,0,the english is intolerant: canadians do not say 'check' but 'bill' is wrong!
duolingo,4,0,good idea - imperfect result!
duolingo,4,0,"this is overall a good pp, especially if you want to enrich your vocabulary and/or refresh your existing knowledge."
duolingo,4,0,there is no grammar explanation but you can learn a lot.
duolingo,4,0,it is more enjoyable than other similar apes.
duolingo,4,0,overall its amazing but my only issue is that it doesn really explain why your wrong.
duolingo,4,0,it just tells you your wrong until you get it right but it does a poor job explaining why your wrong.
duolingo,4,0,"it took me a long time to learn how to conjugal the verb alter bc i confused it with avoid a lot, and i only got past it by consulting a friend who is client."
duolingo,4,0,awesome way to learn.
duolingo,4,0,"sometimes when speaking in for the pronunciation it goes to quick and says it doesn't sound right but, haven't even had a chance to start speaking."
duolingo,4,0,this is only on occasions.
duolingo,4,0,i love using dueling but sometimes it takes so much to load the lessons and sometimes it can load them:(
duolingo,4,0,"its great pp but sometimes it hangs and i couldn open it so my daily streak become 0 ,its happen after the last update"
duolingo,4,0,"really good free pp, very repetition which is good for the brain."
duolingo,4,0,"the check points are way harder than the practice material, so i feel like the practice material maybe needs to be a little harder or check point a little easier."
duolingo,4,0,but that's my one bug.
duolingo,4,0,otherwise it is awesome.
duolingo,4,0,i'm using it very day!
duolingo,4,0,really loved my experience!!!
duolingo,4,0,i would give it 5 stars... but i really would like it if i can use this office!
duolingo,4,0,i don't really have wife... and i have to use my data just for this!
duolingo,4,0,and i keep missing my lessons cause i'd usually run out of data really quickly...
duolingo,4,1,love this pp!!
duolingo,4,1,everything is great.
duolingo,4,1,"the only thing i think should be added to the pp may be the ""grammar"" part which is missing."
duolingo,4,1,we kind need to figure them out on our own.
duolingo,4,1,"if there could be even a little part to teach grammar, that would be the best!"
duolingo,4,0,"domingo hits auditory, kinetic, and visual learning style."
duolingo,4,0,competitive aspects within the community of earners keep you motivate to continue.
duolingo,4,0,the only aspect i don't love is the hearts.
duolingo,4,0,"if you make mistakes you lose hearts, this limiting your mistakes to 5 per day."
duolingo,4,0,"getting something wrong is a great way to learn what is correct, so i think there so limits the fail forward aspect of education."
duolingo,4,0,"other than that, i have been very happy with the learning experience on domingo."
duolingo,4,0,so far so good!
duolingo,4,0,pp makes it easy to start learning a new language.
duolingo,4,0,sometimes it gets repetition but at the same time it's better to have more practice of one word and get to know it well then learn 3 more and mix it up.
duolingo,4,0,"i will see how it turns out after months of use, for now 4/5 because i leave some room for growth."
duolingo,4,0,💪😊
duolingo,4,0,i've been enjoying this pp almost every day for a few weeks.
duolingo,4,0,"really helps to learn a language through repetition, writing, and listening."
duolingo,4,0,would be perfect if you weren't constantly enticed to use the pay version.
duolingo,4,0,but i've had fun even without paying!
duolingo,4,0,the pp itself works great.
duolingo,4,0,"i only wish that they would release more outfits, houses, vehicles or accessories for the owl."
duolingo,4,0,being able to buy more stuff with your lights would motivate me to do more exercises and lessons.
duolingo,4,0,ratification of language learning: more effective than i thought.
duolingo,4,0,"brushing up on makarin with this and it works well, can do 5 minutes a day, easy to pick up where you left off."
duolingo,4,0,"good range of reading, speaking and writing (somewhat) so far."
duolingo,4,0,i love the pp but i can't play any of the andros andisten to the pronunciation what should i do?
duolingo,4,0,so far i've only used the trial version but have been impressed.
duolingo,4,0,it does get a little repetition but i guess that's necessary with learning languages.
duolingo,4,0,the as aren't even that intrusion or annoying.
duolingo,4,0,problems with timing of the speech function makes me miss words on the pp that i didn mispronounce
duolingo,4,0,the latin course forces you to an english sentence structure for translations.
duolingo,4,0,however i have loved every moment of using this pp
duolingo,4,0,as are a bit annoying but otherwise a really nice into to learn a language
duolingo,4,0,"i like the pp, but honestly the passive aggressive modifications get on my nerves."
duolingo,4,0,if you skin a day the modifications get sappy.
duolingo,4,0,i fix the problem with the mid because i enabled my goose voice.
duolingo,4,0,love this!
duolingo,4,0,so convenient to use!
duolingo,4,0,instead of spending mindedness hours on social media doing nothing you can learn something!
duolingo,4,0,at times want hear any of the audit but it might be the fact that i have a happy phone otherwise great pp.
duolingo,4,0,"great pp really convenient and easy to use wish there were more free education apes like these this pp is fantastic , may bien."
duolingo,4,0,the only problem is the heart system .it is understandable that the creator have to make a money in some way to keep the pp running .
duolingo,4,0,in conclusion this pp is great.
duolingo,4,0,its a good pp.
duolingo,4,0,the only thing that is needed is to add english meanings of the words in makarin writing items.
duolingo,4,0,it's not possible to remember the characters without knowing the meaning while practicing.
duolingo,4,0,thank you
duolingo,4,0,this pp being free is fantastic.
duolingo,4,0,very well done.
duolingo,4,0,"for me, next steps should include more focused lessons on grammar, to help conjugal sentences and explain why you are using the words you are opposed to just simply getting you to memories words."
duolingo,4,0,"still, beautiful pp."
duolingo,4,0,easy to follow and learn from...i didn't give it 5 stars only as it isn't perfect but it does appear as if they welcome the feedback to improve the software.
duolingo,4,0,i enjoy learning the languages on do lingo.
duolingo,4,0,i love domingo so so much!
duolingo,4,0,jim finally learning languages i've always wanted to learn - both spanish and russian.
duolingo,4,0,one issue with this andros version of the domingo pp though: the tips they made for the beginning of each learning module just don't appear at all in the russian course.
duolingo,4,0,its good to learn short phrases but it suddenly asks to write in the language you are learning but hasn't taut any of the writing
duolingo,4,0,great learning pp.
duolingo,4,0,i definitely recommend.
duolingo,4,0,only reason for 4 stars is it could explain why this term or that term for this or that purpose.
duolingo,4,0,very very good pp overall and definitely recommend for anyone trying to learn another language
duolingo,4,0,"without an option to rest the level, there is no point of progressing and learning a language."
duolingo,4,0,this seems to be such basic feature in this modern era.
duolingo,4,0,"ironically, the pp doesn't have it thereby making the learning process terribly outdated."
duolingo,4,1,"comfortable learning curve for long term retention, intuition interface and motivation for adults and kiss, all that for free is a great gift, the th star is only missing because i suspect ai could accelerate progress by avoiding part of the repetition which the user already masters."
duolingo,4,0,"i've been learning russian (русский), and the system they use for learning the russian alphabet was painful for me."
duolingo,4,0,i had better results memorizing that using an image with phonyms related to the characters.
duolingo,4,0,"once i did that, the rest of the russian course on domingo is like any other course."
duolingo,4,0,not too bad at all.
duolingo,4,0,can we please allow users to set their reminders for a later time than 9 am and allow us to turn off email practice reminders?
duolingo,4,0,"i tried several times, the pp just revert back to 9 am reminders through push and email modifications, and there's no way to do it through the webster."
duolingo,4,0,"i love do, but this is a little talker-is."
duolingo,4,1,a nice little pp.
duolingo,4,1,no complaints.
duolingo,4,1,good repetition and pacing.
duolingo,4,1,"the only thing i wish they would do is when you type a response in, it would display the proper accents after tapping check."
duolingo,4,1,that really just nitpicking.
duolingo,4,1,otherwise it's a very solid pp.
duolingo,4,0,good and simple.
duolingo,4,0,this pp offers a way to learn english every day.
duolingo,4,0,love it.
duolingo,4,0,it's easy to use.
duolingo,4,0,i don't like that your hearts run out so quickly.
duolingo,4,1,"fun and build up skill really logical, although it would be great to be able to do into the higher level skill without doing the earlier ones."
duolingo,4,1,"some of the english translations are not as an english speaker would express themselves, more direct translations, but the pp is fun and motivation."
duolingo,4,1,love the pp.
duolingo,4,1,very helpful.
duolingo,4,1,"the reminders are annoying,i keep changing them or turning them off and they always rest and for some reason that stupid ""this reminder doesn't seem to be working"" is makes me crazy ll great pp to learn a new language but has some stitches"
duolingo,4,0,love the new tips!
duolingo,4,0,"i took french in high school and felt like i have learned the *why* way better now with that addition, i used to fail out of domingo quires because i didn't understand why the ""s"" at the end of some words felt optional."
duolingo,4,0,"and the helpful tips after accidentally missing a question, it lets you review why you failed the last question."
duolingo,4,0,also love the story mode!
duolingo,4,0,"so much more immersion, especially since the podcasts don't seem to come out.. often?"
duolingo,4,0,at all anymore?
duolingo,4,0,great update des!
duolingo,4,1,love this pp.
duolingo,4,1,it's fun and i do it every day!
duolingo,4,1,only problem is i wish either i could go back a review previous lessons or go over some of the words in previous lessons.
duolingo,4,1,i'm forgetting a lot of words and there isn't really enough review.
duolingo,4,0,i love that its free.
duolingo,4,0,i dont even mind the as.
duolingo,4,0,but when in learning something new give always been a why kind of person.
duolingo,4,0,while it reaches you words its mostly based in memorization.
duolingo,4,0,it doesn explain the grammar behind it you just have to kind of figure it out on your own
duolingo,4,0,"well it mostly remains a pleasant experience, likely costing you only the time it takes to watch an ad."
duolingo,4,0,slight modifications to flash card system with more detail on every level might help solidity this pp to become the all-round winner for language learning.
duolingo,4,0,"easy to use, has amazing selection of languages to choose from, fun and even the as are easy to maneuver."
duolingo,4,0,it would be great to be able to go back and do the lesson again or have more speaking components.
duolingo,4,0,worth downloading :).
duolingo,4,0,"i love domingo, however, i am unable to earn more lights, since everytime i watch a video to earn extra lights, it is just black, no video displays."
duolingo,4,0,its good as an extra tool when you're learning a new learning language as a complete beginner
duolingo,4,0,"the motivation messages are encouraging, and i like the sound effects of when something is correct."
duolingo,4,0,"some of the sentences don't make logical sense, but it's not that bad."
duolingo,4,0,it would be nice if they had more languages on there and didn't focus so much on europe.
duolingo,4,0,"its good actually, i'm learning a lot."
duolingo,4,0,"but i think the process is a bit slow :/ waaaayyy tooooo slooowwwww that instead of pushing myself to learn, i get bored and annoyed."
duolingo,4,0,"but still a good pp, probably just me, but please do some minor improvement for people like me that can easily get bored."
duolingo,4,0,hoping for a fun learning experienceeee
duolingo,4,1,domingo does a good job offering all sorts of different problems to help you learn.
duolingo,4,1,"it offers watching, listening, speaking, and written answers to help your learning."
duolingo,4,1,it would be better if it had taiwanese though.
duolingo,4,1,other than that it's a great pp.
duolingo,4,1,"so far, very interesting and fun way to refresh my basic level of spanish."
duolingo,4,1,"i am almost done with most of the levels available, not sure what happens next and if you need to pay to get to further levels."
duolingo,4,1,already recommended to some friends.
duolingo,4,0,it's a nice alternative to paying for a language software.
duolingo,4,0,"i would give it 5 stars but i think the length of time you have to wait for your hearts to refill is a little much, especially since they cap at 4"
duolingo,4,0,"good cap but after a while asks for subscription, which is quite irritating."
duolingo,4,1,their points system keeps me motivate to keep learning!
duolingo,4,1,i'm learning japanese and they integrate anti fearlessly into the lessons.
duolingo,4,1,"after 3 years of studying japanese in school, i couldn't tell you any anti."
duolingo,4,1,"now with domingo, i feel like a pro!"
duolingo,4,1,much more confident speaking to my family in japan.
duolingo,4,1,the best i've tried.
duolingo,4,1,"if you aren't a casual learner, just go gold on all lessons before starting others, and do practice (“health healing”) often."
duolingo,4,1,"sometimes small types get you a full error (can be annoying), but isn't a frequent issue."
duolingo,4,1,this pp is very easy to use and the format with the little owl moscow is super cut so it makes me want to spend time using it.
duolingo,4,1,the only reason i did not give it five stars is the one language i was originally looking for (tagalog) was not one of the option to learn.
duolingo,4,0,this is a decent pp for beginning to learn spanish.
duolingo,4,0,there is a lot of repetition in the lessons which seems to limit the amount of new words that could be introduced under each category.
duolingo,4,0,its mainly learning vocabulary and not verb conjunction.
duolingo,4,0,"for me as a 73 year old trying to learn garlic, i would like to be able to completely red lessons as many times as i need to so it gets firmly embedded in my head."
duolingo,4,0,"so far i haven't found a way to do that, only the practices, which don't seem to be enough."
duolingo,4,0,"other than that, i really like the pp & the methodology used."
duolingo,4,1,"really educational, fun and easy to use."
duolingo,4,1,occasionally have issues with lessons loading up and there have been a couple of the speaking questions that wouldn't accept your answer unless it was in english but all in all it's a good pp.
duolingo,4,0,enjoyable way to start learning a language.
duolingo,4,0,with japanese a bit of rose learning of the alphabet may help the initial flow.
duolingo,4,0,also i hate the sound of getting something wrong.
duolingo,4,0,may be this could be toned down.
duolingo,4,0,i raises my anxiety levels and contributes to my giving up.
duolingo,4,0,i use this pp every day and i like it.
duolingo,4,0,but i have problem with the new update
duolingo,4,0,i wish this could be solved soon.
duolingo,4,1,i am enjoying the pp.
duolingo,4,1,in taking the chinese course and feel like in actually retaining the characters and their definitions.
duolingo,4,1,to actually learn using this pp.
duolingo,4,1,"i feel you actually have to put time in to get a good result, which is good!"
duolingo,4,1,"i had hoped it would help in teaching to write the characters, but so far i have seen none of it."
duolingo,4,1,"my only complaint is that sometimes the audit will not play, breaking the ""listen and repeat"" exercises."
duolingo,4,1,if that fixed the pp definitely deserves 5 stars.
duolingo,4,0,new update is not really as well as it used to be.
duolingo,4,0,listening and speaking exercises has serious problems and makes it hard for earners to enjoy learning hope domingo will fix it as soon as possible.
duolingo,4,0,gracious 
duolingo,4,0,i am highly upset.
duolingo,4,0,all of a sudden there are hearts where the red gems ( lights) used to be and if you get a sentence wrong it takes away the said heart.
duolingo,4,0,"when hearts are gone, i need to use blue gems to get more hearts."
duolingo,4,0,i want the old way back!!!!
duolingo,4,0,!
duolingo,4,2,stories are a great addition.
duolingo,4,2,they are very fun to complete.
duolingo,4,2,facing some bags after the new update .
duolingo,4,2,"it shows i'm in silver league in leaderboards , even the i advanced to the gold league.. it even shows in my achievement that i reached gold."
duolingo,4,2,"sometimes i have to click twice , to start the lessons ."
duolingo,4,0,"really enjoying this, and the pp is reasonably intuition though i would have appreciated the learning tips and the grammar notes being signposted/available from the start (i hear this was possibly only on the web version)."
duolingo,4,0,"while the amount of as (most irrelevant) has increased, so has the content and pass of practice."
duolingo,4,0,"learning a language should be fun yet practical- so maybe looking for sentences that make more sense then ""she boils chicken"" could be part of the initial lessons to keep the users engaged."
duolingo,4,0,male french pronunciation seems suspect at times.
duolingo,4,0,female is fine.
duolingo,4,1,it has been very helpful in getting basic phrases down.
duolingo,4,1,"it doesn't do much to explain some of the santa and the voice speaks too quickly when you do some of the audit tests but for a free pp this is very, very good."
duolingo,4,1,"love this pp, learning a few different languages, adds are a bit annoying but you have an option to pay for no adds."
duolingo,4,1,"the sentences could do with rousing on basic language used when visiting the country but, good for learning different languages."
duolingo,4,0,"during is an overall great and fun learning pp with very helpful reminders to take your daily lesson, however everytime i try to make a profile it never works, and will either take forever and never load or it load for one second but not make the profile."
duolingo,4,0,it is very annoying and sometimes prevents me from my lessons.
duolingo,4,0,please fix this problem 🙏
duolingo,4,0,a very good pp for learning new languages!!
duolingo,4,0,i loved it... just wished that it would have a feature of controlling audit speed because sometimes difficult sentences or words are not understood with the same speed.
duolingo,4,0,"otherwise, fantastic !!"
duolingo,4,0,!
duolingo,4,0,"its seems like a good pp to learn a language, unfortunately, it doesn seem to incorporate simple reasoning for noun and verb applications."
duolingo,4,0,part of learning a language is learning why/how nous and verbs are applied when it comes to masculine and feminine and how to distinguish proper use.
duolingo,4,1,i like using it when i want to relax and to my surprise i have managed to memories some expressions and words although my sporadic use of it.
duolingo,4,1,"i think is a nice pp to use in one's free time to learn without stress and effort, but ease and comfort."
duolingo,4,0,this has almost been as helpful as a native speaker for me in teaching me german.
duolingo,4,0,it manages to be interesting and keeps the as to a manageable level.
duolingo,4,0,i just can' t use it for long periods of time without losing focus though.
duolingo,4,0,i have used domingo for over 2 years.
duolingo,4,0,it is a well organized program that covers the 4 aspects of language learning equally and well.
duolingo,4,0,i especially like the stories section that has been added.
duolingo,4,0,"the pp is enjoyable to use and motivation, but you need to get a book with some grammar in to understand the rules of the language"
duolingo,4,0,very good.
duolingo,4,0,fun.
duolingo,4,0,silly types can get annoying but overall awesome product
duolingo,4,0,"good for refreshing on vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure"
duolingo,4,0,teaching methods are great but please add rude to the languages taught.
duolingo,4,0,"also, if the tips contained a list of all the vocabulary taught in lesson for memorizing it would also help (ex: for japanese, all the letters with their pronunciation)."
duolingo,4,0,otherwise everything is good.
duolingo,4,0,"easy to use, clear voice to understand, works well with my andros motorola phone."
duolingo,4,0,"just starting out, so far so good."
duolingo,4,0,encouraging graphics.
duolingo,4,0,too many email per day takes it to 4/5
duolingo,4,0,the pp is pretty cool but i wanted to learn cantonese but it only had chinese but there a difference between cantonese and makarin and id like to learn cantonese please add cantonese and makarin!!!!
duolingo,4,0,that my only issue
duolingo,4,0,a fun way to learn languages!
duolingo,4,0,"my only problem is, the audit tracks aren't clear... they are trimmed too short."
duolingo,4,0,the first syllable (and sometimes the last one) isn't audible.
duolingo,4,0,please fix this issue.
duolingo,4,0,"i love this pp as a compliment for traditional classes, if you dont speak or practice the language domingo offers a way for you to increase your vocabulary and not forget the basis at least."
duolingo,4,0,nothing can match group interactions when learning but it is a fun way to study.
duolingo,4,0,"i love learning spanish on this pp, the leaderboards help make the learning more fun!"
duolingo,4,0,i would give it five stars but i recently finished and in the sapphire league and it didn't move me up to the ruby league.
duolingo,4,0,my pp might just be begged but it's pretty annoying to have to beat sapphire league again.
duolingo,4,0,free version is bordering on unable and that's pretty awesome.
duolingo,4,0,"5 stars would only be if there was no ""hearts"" or even if there was 10-20 free hearts after a day as this feature limits you from making mistakes and the pp even says mistakes help you to learn faster."
duolingo,4,0,"once you get into the swing of things, it can be fun."
duolingo,4,0,be nice if they maybe added alphabetical pronunciation and numbers to start.
duolingo,4,0,but well worth giving it a go.
duolingo,4,0,"plus i can find the pay now tax, if i wanted full version for a couple of months or year."
duolingo,4,0,in currently trying spanish.
duolingo,4,0,🙂
duolingo,4,1,i love it!!!
duolingo,4,1,i'm taking a french class in school.
duolingo,4,1,"(online because we don't have any foreign language teachers, and if we did there would only be spanish.)"
duolingo,4,1,"its kind hard to actually learn a language from an online class, so i started looking around and found this."
duolingo,4,1,i download it and so far it's been amazing!!!!
duolingo,4,1,!😁😁 i'm practicing all around the house now.
duolingo,4,1,"and i love the leaderboard, makes it a little competitive and encourages me to do it more."
duolingo,4,1,10/10.
duolingo,4,1,can put down my phone now because of it.
duolingo,4,0,it was all good till i reached the first check point i was learning spanish ...the checkpoint was too tough .i mean it had nothing of any sort which was taught ...it was just too difficult ..90% of the words were new..it made no sense why you would make it this hard..otherwise it is really good pp and very much user friendly ..but that checkpoint test .just breaks my heart
duolingo,4,0,many languages to choose from.
duolingo,4,0,good interface.
duolingo,4,0,"i think it could improve on how it reaches you verb conjugations, and that's why it gets 4 stars from me instead of 5."
duolingo,4,0,great!
duolingo,4,0,"the only suggestion would be to increase the frequency that you have to write the sentence in the language you're trying to learn, rather than translating to the language you already know."
duolingo,4,0,this would be super useful for training grammar.
duolingo,4,0,"good for learning the language, but the lessons can get a bit too long"
duolingo,4,0,it's a pretty cool pp and you should add like people to make friends with and to understand each other
duolingo,4,0,great pp.
duolingo,4,0,but you can only learn one language at a time.
duolingo,4,0,you cannot select multiple languages .
duolingo,4,0,fun and new experience in learning and reviewing languages.
duolingo,4,0,too many as and limitation of mistake allowance in the free copy makes it a bit frustration.
duolingo,4,0,"repetition exercises could be boring, but could be beneficial as well."
duolingo,4,0,i liked it overall..
duolingo,4,0,"it's good learning the basis so far, sometimes the voices blend too much for certain words making it hard to decide how to answer, but overall it's a good pp."
duolingo,4,0,pretty good.
duolingo,4,0,a little bit too easy and redundant.
duolingo,4,0,too focused on words and not enough on building sentences.
duolingo,4,0,lots of as too.
duolingo,4,0,"still, its pretty good."
duolingo,4,0,it's not a bad pp.
duolingo,4,0,great going at your own pace.
duolingo,4,0,the hearts take a long time to regenerate which can sometimes take the fun out of learning.
duolingo,4,0,i am certainly considering paying so i don't run out of lives.
duolingo,4,0,so i get uninterrupted learning
duolingo,4,0,"it is great pp, but it could be even greater if they make it into a program that makes our target language client."
duolingo,4,0,also it would be really helpful if they show us the stroke order for the letters of different language.
duolingo,4,0,(learning japanese) would be nice if we had the option to omit anti from the text until we've memories them from a corresponding tinycards deck submitted by domingo.
duolingo,4,0,"also, an option to enable questions in which the user submits japanese text they type would be much appreciated."
duolingo,4,0,"a fun way to learn, however the pp could use a glossy of words you've learned, as well as a proper pronunciation guide."
duolingo,4,0,"i can copy the voice perfectly, yet the pp still won't register that i've said it correctly."
duolingo,4,0,while i love easy leveling up they need to add more lessons to level 3 and 4 on the topics.
duolingo,4,0,"in the past there were 12 and 20 respectively, which i agree made it a bit boring but 4 is too little."
duolingo,4,0,maybe 8 and 12 lessons?
duolingo,4,1,pretty good.
duolingo,4,1,"the easier lessons get a bit repetition, there could be more variations on ways to say the same thing."
duolingo,4,1,otherwise very useful.
duolingo,4,1,i completed german and portuguese and have gone back for practice since.
duolingo,4,0,i like it.
duolingo,4,0,something different to do instead of strolling through twitter.
duolingo,4,0,the rewards make it more fun.
duolingo,4,0,i paid though so not sure what free pp would be like.
duolingo,4,0,"if you're serious about learning a language, you need to invest anyway."
duolingo,4,0,"this is a great pp, one thing i wish it had is that you can look up sentences and see how they are pronounced, so basically a dictionary."
duolingo,4,0,other than that you guns are amazing!
duolingo,4,0,love the french!
duolingo,4,0,😊
duolingo,4,0,this pp is definitely for people who know a little already.
duolingo,4,0,if i didn't already know hiragana and katakana i would be so stuck and probably would have given up.
duolingo,4,0,since i took two years of japanese many years ago this pp helps as a good reminder and listening practice.
duolingo,4,0,i am using the free version so the as can be annoying.
duolingo,4,0,i am finding that it is not moving me along as quickly as i would want to more difficult material.
duolingo,4,0,otherwise recommended.
duolingo,4,1,i really like the pp.
duolingo,4,1,"it would be nice to select a category to work on, though."
duolingo,4,1,then be provided with a summary of the lesson afterwards to reinforce the learning.
duolingo,4,1,i have a bad memory so i often forget what i've learned almost immediately.
duolingo,4,0,"it's a good start for a new language, but the audit seems to cut out for no reason periodically."
duolingo,4,0,might just be my phone?
duolingo,4,0,but it only happens with domingo.
duolingo,4,0,a great way to learn many different languages and overall there is so many to pick from although i would recommend adding more lives and more languages but this is a great learning pp and i have learned clot!
duolingo,4,0,^^
duolingo,4,0,a useful pp for learning and enforcing a language.
duolingo,4,0,"my only reservation is that my page (esperanto) is frequently revised, meaning my progress is often removed if i am to complete all the lessons in each new section."
duolingo,4,0,i find it easy to use.
duolingo,4,0,it has built my confidence and desire to stick with the effort to learn spanish.
duolingo,4,0,this pp is really great to practice language use.
duolingo,4,0,it makes it fun to learn new vocabulary and lessons.
duolingo,4,0,4 stars because i feel like you have to have prior basic knowledge of the language you want to learn before getting this pp.
duolingo,4,0,hi dear domingo team i am surprised by this pp every day more and more it's amazing but recently i got some troubles with sounds.
duolingo,4,0,i am not able to do the listening related parts.
duolingo,4,0,i'll be grateful if u fix it as soon as possible.
duolingo,4,0,i appreciate that the as in the free version aren't intrusion.
duolingo,4,0,"domingo is better suited for written comprehension-- it's best to practice a lot of speaking and listening through media and, if you can, native speakers."
duolingo,4,0,it's a good pp for learning third language.
duolingo,4,0,"for people like us who speak persian, learning english with this pp is impossible, because first is not one of its input languages."
duolingo,4,0,but i'm learning germany and it's been good so far.
duolingo,4,0,i just think it was better if it has better description in the beginning
duolingo,4,1,good pp with lots of free content to learn a big variety of languages!
duolingo,4,1,"just a few minor flaws (sometimes slightly awkward english translations, some pronunciation don't sound native, and the pp sometimes cuts me off mid-sentence in speaking exercises)"
duolingo,4,0,i've had the pp for 11 days and so far it seems to be working.
duolingo,4,0,"learning a language (spanish for me) is fun and challenging, i have a long way to go though."
duolingo,4,0,"i'm not using just the pp to learn spanish , i'm also reading lyric and listening to music and watching familiar moves i know in spanish with subtitles."
duolingo,4,0,this pp is definitely a foundation for the way i'm learning the language.
duolingo,4,0,excellent pp.
duolingo,4,0,hardly any adds.
duolingo,4,0,a good amount of repetition allows you to be confident in what you're learning.
duolingo,4,0,helpful comments/ tips on each lesson from other users.
duolingo,4,0,only issue was losing stories when twitching from apple to andros
duolingo,4,0,love the pp.
duolingo,4,0,there are times when i must select words and i can't because they don't fully appear on the screen.
duolingo,4,0,this prevents me from moving on to the next question..please fix.
duolingo,4,0,i'm using motor go-plus
duolingo,4,0,"excellent learning pp, could do with some descriptions of santa and grammatical quires as well as the lessons, and some languages (greek) don't have very good pronunciation."
duolingo,4,0,"overall, an excellent pp."
duolingo,4,0,"(also, what's after ruby league?)"
duolingo,4,0,good language learning pp that can be used for free without too many inconvenience.
duolingo,4,0,it lacks a bit of depth to explore the grammar or actual dialogue to listen to and learn from.
duolingo,4,3,i'm enjoying domingo stories and reaching my daily goal easier because of them.
duolingo,4,3,it also helps that there are hints and tips in the pp.
duolingo,4,3,i can't wait for stories in other languages.
duolingo,4,3,keep improving.
duolingo,4,0,it is a good pp for learning new ranges.
duolingo,4,0,"domingo straits you off with basic levels, there is different subjects."
duolingo,4,0,"if you get like 5 wrong on a lesson and you don't have domingo plus well ,your heart will have no lives and you'll have to wait 4 hours and about 23 minutes."
duolingo,4,0,"this pp is really good to learn, but i think it would be better without translate the words."
duolingo,4,0,translate is not the best way to learn a language.
duolingo,4,0,"in my opinion, use image would be better."
duolingo,4,1,this pp is great for learning new languages!
duolingo,4,1,the only problem i have is that why do you have to make a profile?
duolingo,4,1,can it save instead of making a profile?
duolingo,4,1,although great pp!
duolingo,4,1,i really recommend it for people trying out different languages.
duolingo,4,1,😋
duolingo,4,0,good pp..it's nice you can practice anywhere your phone is... could improve the pronunciation part though...haven been able to hear what the correct pronunciation is...it helps when you can slow the speaker down..
duolingo,4,0,"domingo succeeds in engaging me to learn hebrew, and it does this skillfully."
duolingo,4,0,"this is not only because i want to learn, but also because it makes it easy to cover the various aspects of the learning process - without requiring me to think too long about what to learn next."
duolingo,4,0,in new version it doesn't have sounds!!!!why?????
duolingo,4,0,?
duolingo,4,0,"it's great, though i wish it had a lesson first then the questions, so that we understand what is happening before answering questions to something we don't know how to pronounce."
duolingo,4,0,"but the pp is great, i would recommend"
duolingo,4,0,pretty good overall but has a few issues.
duolingo,4,0,lessons sometimes start without giving you enough information such as using words not previously taught.
duolingo,4,0,would be nice to have a vocal library to keep track of words you've learned so far.
duolingo,4,0,it's nice to use but i don't really like to type a lot.
duolingo,4,0,i prefer to press on the words because it's quicker and my keyboard on my phone is not the best.
duolingo,4,0,it's finicky.
duolingo,4,0,but overall i like the pp.
duolingo,4,0,most of the times it's easy to use.
duolingo,4,0,great tool to really learn and practice foreign languages 
duolingo,4,0,"4/5 because even if you can activate them, there's still a lot of as."
duolingo,4,0,"i've used this pp every day for eight months and am now able to say basic phrases, read russian ingredient lists, identify characters and guess the phonetics of new words, and write in russian characters."
duolingo,4,0,i am a plus member-- support this pp.
duolingo,4,0,some minor issues but overall a good experience.
duolingo,4,0,"for serious language earners, i would also suggest some kind of grammar rules rather than trying to understand them thou repetition."
duolingo,4,0,brilliant pp only thing i would change is give us the ability to search for words or phrases we have learned in the past so that we can familiarity our serves with the phrases that may be more suited to our experiences in the real world.
duolingo,4,1,"been great learning it so far, easy to use while traveling or just have an extra moment."
duolingo,4,1,i wish it let you practice the so each part more.
duolingo,4,1,it might later as i'm still new to this.
duolingo,4,1,"great overall, glad to be learning!"
duolingo,4,1,!
duolingo,4,0,great pp!
duolingo,4,0,very useful and interactive for learning be languages.
duolingo,4,0,"the main drawback in this pp is, while starting a lesson the desktop site provides an additional light bulb symbol which gives an overview about the lesson but in the pp its not available."
duolingo,4,0,i really like domingo!
duolingo,4,0,it takes you through the course slowly but surely -with a lot of repeats.
duolingo,4,0,i'm studying arabic and it is good for pronunciation- reading and writing.
duolingo,4,0,i would like more learning tips and some place where you could see the words you have learned & how to pronounce them .
duolingo,4,0,thanks
duolingo,4,0,"it's has helped me learn the basis so far, but the only small complaint i have is knowing how to resume where i left off in the lesson."
duolingo,4,0,i would say the pp isn't well organized in the home screen.
duolingo,4,0,"other than that, it's great!"
duolingo,4,2,what a fun and effective way to learn a new language!
duolingo,4,2,only complaint is they kind leave you in the dark when it comes to what the language rules are and why some things are the way they are.
duolingo,4,2,"but it comes with a nice ""forum"" of other users that do know the language and they leave helpful comments."
duolingo,4,0,quite good for learning and retaining phrases.
duolingo,4,0,there is a small audit problem though.
duolingo,4,0,sometimes it won't say the word out loud.
duolingo,4,0,its inconsistent with that.
duolingo,4,0,"but overall, it's a great way to learn a new language."
duolingo,4,0,"it is a great source of learning languages how ever i don't like this new heart system, it takes ages to refill and it stops learning."
duolingo,4,0,not a huge fan of this.
duolingo,4,0,good and easy pp to effectively learn a language.
duolingo,4,0,"the only thing i really miss is a list of the words that i learned, with in one column the english words and in the other the learned translation."
duolingo,4,0,needs more features for organ.
duolingo,4,0,"i noticed that when learning spanish, there were extra lessons you played ignore for, a new tax to listen to stories, and each lesson had a light bulb with good information before you started a lesson."
duolingo,4,0,organ does't have any of that.
duolingo,4,0,makes learning a language feel like a video game and i love that.
duolingo,4,0,my only issue is that the sound doesn't always work for new lessons (hiragana 2 specifically) and i'm stuck guessing (often incorrectly) what it wants from me.
duolingo,4,0,"lots of encouragement, repetition, different contents for same words, and different words for same sentences."
duolingo,4,0,"however, i look for rules as well as ratification, so if it had explanations of how linguistic rules change i would give it 5 stars."
duolingo,4,0,i love the help domingo helps you have fun but most of all learn the language.
duolingo,4,0,word to word.
duolingo,4,0,i would like to see how a conversation between two or more would look like though.
duolingo,4,0,its a good thing that do exists.
duolingo,4,0,i learned japanese because of it.
duolingo,4,0,best 🦉 5/5.
duolingo,4,0,"but, i want progress quit for free like in computer, not pro."
duolingo,4,1,"love the a, learning japanese and it's great, the only downside is you cannot do speaking exercises with japanese."
duolingo,4,1,would be great if they could change that and would give them a 5 star rating.
duolingo,4,0,great but ply make more go on such as in the shop - i have loads of lights but nothing to spend them on!
duolingo,4,0,also if you could include an option of tying the answer rather than using the words in the boxing to make it harder.
duolingo,4,0,the edit: ply also add a higher daily goals.
duolingo,4,0,cheers
duolingo,4,0,i don't know how to explain it but i did learn quite a bit but for some reason i can't quite comprehend i could say or get the whole lesson class and leveling doesn't quite seem right or feel right if that makes any sense at all?
duolingo,4,0,could say don't like the whole set up and everything for leveling and act ..
duolingo,4,0,"nice application, very interactive, but i would have loved it more if we could possibly be able to do an online quit competition with our friends, would be nice."
duolingo,4,0,excellent language learning tool.
duolingo,4,0,i've made more progress in 4 days than i expected.
duolingo,4,0,i can use it free if i watch short as.
duolingo,4,0,i would pay to upgrade but they won't accept my c for some reason.
duolingo,4,1,"in learning irish right now, and i really like the repetition of words and phrases to help me learn."
duolingo,4,1,"the downside is not all words are pronounced so i know what they sound like, or pronounced very slowly."
duolingo,4,0,"good, but still needs improvement."
duolingo,4,0,"i still occasionally get stitches, most common is a lesson won't load and i have to start the pp."
duolingo,4,0,would also be nice if stories were integrated in a tax on the pp.
duolingo,4,0,for a total beginner the pp is perfect.
duolingo,4,0,"i would like more speaking practice, but a friend tells me it gets that way once the student crosses a certain level."
duolingo,4,0,"right now, it works great for me."
duolingo,4,0,this is a great way to develop language skill.
duolingo,4,0,i love that it gives me daily accountability and that i can do a little or a lot on any given day.
duolingo,4,0,however i have encountered stitches and reported it but never received any sort of response.
duolingo,4,0,it's a very good educational pp .
duolingo,4,0,but recently in the last update the pp's stared to have problems loading the tests and usually lost the voice to pronounce the words or sentences.
duolingo,4,0,i hope that in the new update all these problems are solved
duolingo,4,0,"domingo is a fun, quick, and easy way to learn a new language."
duolingo,4,0,"it has a variety of learning strategics in one lesson, such as speaking, reading, listening, and more, so that you get a well-rounded learning experience."
duolingo,4,0,it's also super fun!
duolingo,4,0,honestly great way to learn a language it works wonders i'm left already getting the translations stuck in my head
duolingo,4,0,this is a very easy to use pp and ideal for a beginner like myself.
duolingo,4,0,"the pp interface is awesome, but for some languages like makarin, i feel that it is not beginner friendly."
duolingo,4,0,it's more of an intermediate practice for people who already know the basis in my opinion
duolingo,4,0,"i love it oh so much, and it is very useful except for the fact that i dont get anymore modifications but they go to mt moss e mail"
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp but i find one fault in it that i couldn't talk to native speaker .
duolingo,4,0,sometimes i confused in many words so i can't share my problem with them .
duolingo,4,0,team domingo please give an update with essaying feature as soon as possible
duolingo,4,1,"i love this pp, so far give learnt clot."
duolingo,4,1,my only suggestion is to design better contents for the lesson you work on and some more detailed explanations as to why the answer is right or wrong
duolingo,4,0,it is quite a good pp but a friend of mine is having a problem regarding getting the latest update.
duolingo,4,0,we cannot compete in the same ground as he has to complete 20 lessons to go from level 4 to 5 in a topic.
duolingo,4,0,enjoy the pp.
duolingo,4,0,sometimes navigation is not clear or i'm not always sure why i can't refill hearts to continue --- seem to only get more by paying for the plus version or i wipe out my progress.
duolingo,4,0,this is the number one pp i would recommend to someone looking to learn a new language.
duolingo,4,0,its a great pp.
duolingo,4,0,and download it!😂
duolingo,4,0,"easy to use, looks good, works well."
duolingo,4,0,only a real pity the tips and grammar are not available on the pp.
duolingo,4,0,"i'm doing arabic and it's hard to learn without the theory, and i can't always use my lawton."
duolingo,4,0,it would be useful to be able to have a list of the words learned along the way to be able to revise
duolingo,4,1,where else could you learn latin and swahili and other wonderful languages..for free!
duolingo,4,1,"love the podcasts, my listening skill have really improved."
duolingo,4,1,the stories are good.. could maybe have more variety ( same stories in all languages).
duolingo,4,1,"overall, an excellent learning tool."
duolingo,4,0,the pp is easy and funny.
duolingo,4,0,"it gives you a very nice way to practice every day , everywhere, showing you images, giving you voices and the opportunity to practice your pronunciation."
duolingo,4,0,some minor things could be improved e.g.
duolingo,4,0,single nous should always be learned along with their respective articles.
duolingo,4,0,"also, speaking exercises should be respectable if they were rate partly red (i.e."
duolingo,4,0,not full right).
duolingo,4,0,otherwise great so far.
duolingo,4,0,"i love the pp and it reaches me a lot, but i am still learning a language and whenever i get a word wrong i lose health points and you have to do a lesson and get them all right to earn back health points."
duolingo,4,0,i think it is really good and fun i gave it a 4 star rating because it did not let me have a lot of chance but i love how there is a leader bored i am angry because you have to pay for free parts but i think if you have had 3 months on domingo you get free parts love charlotte
duolingo,4,0,i gave it 4 stars because i don't really like the idea of hearts i think you should be able to just keep on learning rather than being forced to pay £60 a year for infinite hearts
duolingo,4,0,pro: positive self-paced language pp that does a great job.
duolingo,4,0,even the as are not overwhelming and horrible.
duolingo,4,0,con: would like to see explanations of grammar.
duolingo,4,0,i think it would help in the learning process.
duolingo,4,0,all works well and is absolutely excellent but x boost mode never worked for me after amethyst league.
duolingo,4,0,i failed your team but there wasn't any response.
duolingo,4,0,let the problem be set right please.
duolingo,4,0,thanks
duolingo,4,0,"it is a great pp, i'm learning spanish and i think it is very effective."
duolingo,4,0,"however, because we have to have hearts, it slow down learning progress."
duolingo,4,0,"domingo, please can you stop the hearts as they let down your pp."
duolingo,4,0,"you won't get client in most languages, and it does have some errors."
duolingo,4,0,"but it's free and it's always being updated, not to mention it is quite easy to use and fun at times."
duolingo,4,0,helpful way in which errors are represented in a different format.
duolingo,4,0,disappointing that so much time is spent just in present tense.
duolingo,4,0,stories are entertaining in spanish.
duolingo,4,0,some of the english usage in the chinese is difficult to recognise.
duolingo,4,0,enjoy do but there are a few annoyance .poses questions where you can't differentiate between sexes then says you're wrong when you guess wrong and sometimes takes ages to load but apart from the little singles a great pp for free !
duolingo,4,0,!
duolingo,4,0,it's great and all but it's dumb that we have to pay or wait 4+ hours to have a heart to play... i liked it more when we could learn as much as we wanted :/
duolingo,4,0,the pp is great but sometimes the voice just stops working
duolingo,4,0,great pp.
duolingo,4,0,just wish for a few tears and an overall introductory explanation of the many features so i would know what they do and what they are for.
duolingo,4,0,"i am making good progress, though, and am grateful for it."
duolingo,4,0,very good program but helps if you have a few basis of the language before you start.
duolingo,4,0,i like that each lesson is short so that you can learn without feeling overwhelmed
duolingo,4,0,good easy to use pp.
duolingo,4,0,it allows you to repeat lessons for free and lays a good foundation before teaching phrases and grammar
duolingo,4,1,"some unnatural sentences, but ultimately one of the best learning tools, especially for beginners and vocal."
duolingo,4,1,"would love it if they released conjugations tables with all the pronunciation, they would be unstoppable."
duolingo,4,0,i enjoy using domingo.
duolingo,4,0,works well.
duolingo,4,0,i do at times have problems with the voice part of this pp just not understanding me.
duolingo,4,0,overall i am happy and have recommended it to other people.
duolingo,4,0,works great except a few tiny fleches.
duolingo,4,0,"appreciate the fun way it reaches, very encouraging, i'm ecstatic i can learn at my own pace and on my own schedule."
duolingo,4,0,"one of the best opportunities available, by far!"
duolingo,4,0,than domingo!
duolingo,4,0,easy to use first and foremost.
duolingo,4,0,it uses several different ways to help you learn the language.
duolingo,4,0,"you read it, write it and speak it which for me makes it much easier to learn."
duolingo,4,0,"it's left, but perhaps it needs to be a little more organized"
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp!
duolingo,4,0,"but there's just one thing, the health things annoy me clot because when you get something wrong you should just keep trying and not get a penalty from wrong answers."
duolingo,4,0,great with repetition while gradually adding more vocabulary.
duolingo,4,0,"some of the phrases are odd and not useful (""hello, horse""), but i understand it's not all about the words themselves."
duolingo,4,0,"i would rate 5 stars but, when i am in a rush, i click to select a word and then press check."
duolingo,4,0,then i realise that the last word had not been selected.
duolingo,4,0,please make it more sensitive.
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp!
duolingo,4,0,i can learn french practically .
duolingo,4,0,but wish there were more categories and health.
duolingo,4,0,after 5 mistakes you have to wait a while for the health to fill up.
duolingo,4,0,and it takes a while😥
duolingo,4,0,"fantastic pp and a really good, thought out learning tool!"
duolingo,4,0,"my only issue is with the arabic course, some of the characters are too large so the tops are cut off!"
duolingo,4,0,if small bags like this were fixed it would be perfect!
duolingo,4,0,"very useful pp, only little problem is that the hearts (mistakes) you can make is 5, then takes 5 hours to refresh or you can use diamonds to refresh, disrupt the temps a little"
duolingo,4,0,good for getting into a rhythm and learning gradually.
duolingo,4,0,"its an amazing learning pp, i have learnt a lot with funny exercises."
duolingo,4,0,"just a few issues, sometimes the pp take more life than you lost and there is a constantly bug that don't let me take a new lesson until i start the pp"
duolingo,4,0,amazing pp.
duolingo,4,0,i'm learning so much faster than i ever would in a class.
duolingo,4,0,it's adjective to me ll.
duolingo,4,0,i just wish i could interact a little more with friends and others.
duolingo,4,0,but it's super fun competing in the leaderboards 😁
duolingo,4,0,"good, fun and educational pp."
duolingo,4,0,in some of the lessons there is way too much repetition and there are too many nonsense sentences but overall a very good pp.
duolingo,4,1,love this pp!
duolingo,4,1,"only thing that would make it better is more practice speaking, but maybe i'll see that as i get further in the pp."
duolingo,4,1,the as are only slightly annoying.
duolingo,4,0,best pp for learning any language!
duolingo,4,0,it's simple and just fun!
duolingo,4,0,!
duolingo,4,0,i really love this pp.
duolingo,4,0,i just have a hard time hearing the sounds.
duolingo,4,0,they are not as clear as i would like them.
duolingo,4,0,i have learned though how to see the characters in hind.
duolingo,4,0,really learning clot.
duolingo,4,0,thanks!
duolingo,4,0,good pp in general.
duolingo,4,0,"in the latest versions there is a bug with as which is quite annoying: even if the as audit is mute, when the video start the volume is on, so you need to until/tap to mute it again."
duolingo,4,0,recently i faced problem with sound.
duolingo,4,0,what is wrong with it?
duolingo,4,0,i just hear sound of answering questions result and tapping on the next.
duolingo,4,0,there is no sound of the man or woman who read the text.
duolingo,4,0,really easy and enjoyable way to learn a new language or revise an old one.
duolingo,4,0,currently working on garlic and spanish and enjoying them both.
duolingo,4,0,it could do with rules or explanations in between lessons to explain why certain words state etc
duolingo,4,0,in really enjoying it and love the little rewards and up that come with completing lessons 👍
duolingo,4,0,it’s very helpful.
duolingo,4,0,"an easy option for beginners, i guess."
duolingo,4,0,i dont like the new update because you get a certain amount of hearts.
duolingo,4,0,when you is up those hearts then you have to wait a while to get more.
duolingo,4,0,no hearts no playing.
duolingo,4,0,but other than that it's a good game.
duolingo,4,0,"i love domingo, the only things that keeps it from getting a 5 star is the fact that it doesn't track the amount of time spent working on a language."
duolingo,4,0,only they date started.
duolingo,4,0,i would love to see this feature in an update!
duolingo,4,0,this pp is pretty cool everything is free unless you don't want as.
duolingo,4,0,i think it's brilliant currently trying to speak norwegian and it's helping me clot.
duolingo,4,0,great pp for learning any language....extremely fun and very entertaining...the time flies with the application.
duolingo,4,0,all that's missing is a bit more dialogue with other persons in your league to help.
duolingo,4,0,nice pp great for intermediate language earners however could make it a bit easier to navigable and better value on the free version considering how much they stress that they want learning languages should be free it posters you a lot to download premium version.
duolingo,4,0,"love this pp, so easy to learn and at your own rate."
duolingo,4,0,very good pp.
duolingo,4,0,the score is slightly lowered because the additional notes available on the desktop version cannot be viewed via the pp.
duolingo,4,0,i wish there were option to listen to longer audit and to write paragraphs later on
duolingo,4,0,very repetition which for me means it stays in your mind better
duolingo,4,0,this language pp makes learning fun.
duolingo,4,0,"having taken two years of spanish in high school helped at first, then exceeded what i remembered (from +40 years ago)."
duolingo,4,0,it was very helpful to already know the alphabet sounds for expected pronunciation.
duolingo,4,0,mostly very well done.
duolingo,4,0,"lights are poorly thought out, and there are occasional issues with the actual content, but it's easy enough to report those and get them corrected."
duolingo,4,0,i really enjoy domingo.
duolingo,4,0,it's very user-friendly.
duolingo,4,0,it's easy to portion your learning.
duolingo,4,0,i wish there was a bit more listening examples and that the grammar explanations were available on my telephone.
duolingo,4,0,i found this is an interesting application if you love to learn new language.. a lot of lessons and exercises and they help me easy to remember..thank you!
duolingo,4,0,it is a very helpful pp.
duolingo,4,0,i am learning french and it is so much easier and fun to learn.
duolingo,4,0,i recommend it.
duolingo,4,0,"it's really awesome to have an option to learn a language without needing to spend lots of money and the lessons are done in a really user friendly way, i would like to have more opportunities to practice speaking the language."
duolingo,4,0,it helps to learn the language but it doesn't really teach you the vocal that well or the sentence patterns.
duolingo,4,0,but if it's not your main source of information then i still recommend it to help you memories.
duolingo,4,0,great pp - disappointing recent update.
duolingo,4,0,the recent update on the 03/12/2019 has taken my progress back to where i was about 4 weeks ago.
duolingo,4,0,"my progress has been lost which is highly annoying, any chance of getting it back domingo?"
duolingo,4,0,great product but definitely well engineered for you to get the paid product.
duolingo,4,0,i hated the hearts system on the free version so much that i just bought it so i wouldn't have to deal with it.
duolingo,4,0,first of all thanks for the great pp you've produced.
duolingo,4,0,recently l have problems with the sound.
duolingo,4,0,the pronunciation is missing in the lessons.
duolingo,4,0,how can i solve this problem?
duolingo,4,0,!
duolingo,4,0,very cool pp.
duolingo,4,0,loving every bit of it.
duolingo,4,0,"although, the part where you have to pronounce so you can advance in the lesson is kind of shake."
duolingo,4,0,aside that the pp is awesome.
duolingo,4,0,i like to learn languages with this pp it is a very good pp.
duolingo,4,0,it has so many languages.
duolingo,4,0,it makes learning easy.
duolingo,4,0,misleading it says learn english.
duolingo,4,0,but in option there are many languages.
duolingo,4,0,fun and easy to use for now.
duolingo,4,0,sure it will be getting harder.
duolingo,4,0,this pp reaches you at a very steady and manageable pace allowing you to learn slowly or fast.
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp.
duolingo,4,0,it makes learning russian easily accessible.
duolingo,4,0,pretty nice tool for learning another language.
duolingo,4,0,some additional work around incorporating anti for japanese would be helpful.
duolingo,4,0,"for the price, it's really good."
duolingo,4,0,it's great for motivation but the structure is a little annoying - progress on so many levels all over the place with no clear trajectory.
duolingo,4,0,i work on five sessions a day and am progressing well in french.
duolingo,4,0,"i use a phone and tablet, phone pp has more oral exercises."
duolingo,4,0,as an australian some of the american usage is frustration in translation.
duolingo,4,0,"great pp,, i'm leaning a lot."
duolingo,4,0,just wish it had the same features on my mobile pp as on a computer like being able to look at the alphabet and learn the genetic pronunciation of all the letters.
duolingo,4,0,"it is a good pp to learn languages but lately it has problem doubling the lights, it supposedly to watch the adv for few seas but turns out the screen goes all black and stuck."
duolingo,4,0,i hope duoliongo can solve this problem sooner.
duolingo,4,0,i am happy to meet this current pp full of helpful revisions which allow to high intermediate to remind himself many elementary things.
duolingo,4,0,"furthermore, i am not happy for the way that they constraint earners to go back because of two faults."
duolingo,4,0,"this pp made me learn multiple spanish phrases in 3 days, i find this to be a very fun and interactive pp."
duolingo,4,0,the only this ban that others me is that you have limited hearts which means you can only learn new thing for a limited time.
duolingo,4,0,i started doing this in the morning about 3 weeks ago and have been surprised at how easy it has been to keep at it everyday.
duolingo,4,0,the pp does a great job encouraging you to keep practicing and it feels good to learn!
duolingo,4,0,i think that its a great pp to learn spanish the only this i would say is that you have to wait until the heart fills up to use the apes and the hearts go down once you get something wrong but except from that i love the pp its easy to work with and again its a easy way to learn spanish
duolingo,4,0,this is a good pp if you're using it in combination with language lessons.
duolingo,4,0,the pp by itself isn't actually teaching you anything.
duolingo,4,0,"in my experience, the best way to use this pp is by learning a language and testing yourself on the pp."
duolingo,4,0,superb!
duolingo,4,0,this pp got me back into learning a foreign language... and i keep on learning (i'm on a 467 day streak).
duolingo,4,0,"on the negative side, it's ""shop"" is an embarrassment."
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp.
duolingo,4,0,the only problem i keep running into is there is some sort of pitch which will not allow me to select answers on quite a few of the levels.
duolingo,4,0,i have remained the company with no response.
duolingo,4,0,this pp is perfect to learn languages.
duolingo,4,0,just that there are some specific languages which could be involved like martha but other than that it is all awesome.
duolingo,4,0,if there is martha included then i am sorry for the comment.
duolingo,4,0,😊😊😊😊😊😊😄😄
duolingo,4,0,its just great for beginners.
duolingo,4,0,it gets boring for me since there are some things i have to through but i already know.
duolingo,4,0,"anyway, i love it."
duolingo,4,0,"it doesn't feel like learning, more like playing a game.. it seems to really work, the words are sinking in without me trying."
duolingo,4,0,it could use a dictionary though.
duolingo,4,0,"the pp generally works well, my phone case makes it hard to complete the speaking sections."
duolingo,4,0,what i hate is that you have to complete the day's lesson by midnight in order to maintain your streak.
duolingo,4,0,so insane!
duolingo,4,1,"great pp, easy to use and understand."
duolingo,4,1,the only thing that would bother me is the constant as and the amount of gems earned per lesson.
duolingo,4,1,still great though
duolingo,4,0,the pp is great!
duolingo,4,0,just had one issue... i wanted to refill my hearts and i paid 450 diamonds for it.
duolingo,4,0,now just 137 are left but the hearts didn't get filled...
duolingo,4,1,makes learning foreign languages easier than other methods for free.
duolingo,4,1,"helps you to learn to not only speak, but also properly pronounce the words also which is important."
duolingo,4,0,easiest way to learn a language and the leaderboard is a great way to motivate one to practice
duolingo,4,0,"good free pp, as are a pain but can get rid of if you pay plus you can also get unlimited hearts, but if your like me and don't like paying for extra you can still learn extensively without a problem using the pp"
duolingo,4,0,"pretty good pp for learning languages, especially for a free pp."
duolingo,4,0,"issue is, i cannot add my friend so that we can track each other's progress."
duolingo,4,0,"domingo, please fix this."
duolingo,4,0,"awesome way to refresh a language, but i find that if you want to learn from scratch, you should supplement domingo with some other textbook or learning software."
duolingo,4,0,the pp is great except that you it was programme with hard to pronounce words in sequence.
duolingo,4,0,it seems like it's tongue blisters most the time.
duolingo,4,0,"feels like a game, but you're learning a new language."
duolingo,4,0,super easy.
duolingo,4,0,"the hearts are a bit annoying, and i wish the pp wasn't so push for you to get pro, but otherwise it's great."
duolingo,4,0,it's all the way good..but clues aren't provided along with the courses.
duolingo,4,0,there's no explanation for usage of new forms.
duolingo,4,0,liked it great deal.
duolingo,4,0,i learned the basis of a couple languages.
duolingo,4,0,i like how it gives u time limits.
duolingo,4,0,it is fun.
duolingo,4,0,"they always remind me, to practice."
duolingo,4,0,"that,s encouraging and rewarding."
duolingo,4,0,they are special.
duolingo,4,0,"i only wish that i had more time to really move more quickly, but in glad that they go at a normal pace, and give option."
duolingo,4,0,good clear instructions with plenty of revision and scope for extended learning
duolingo,4,0,it's one of the best pp for learning languages.
duolingo,4,0,but it needs some more improvements.
duolingo,4,0,please make more and more tying and speaking practices instead of buttons.
duolingo,4,0,it's helpful.
duolingo,4,0,i'm able to learn and speak the language to the best of my ability.
duolingo,4,0,"sometimes, i would like to skin the basic steps and go to the conversation lesson."
duolingo,4,0,"however, the pp doesn't allow it."
duolingo,4,0,"i very much love this pp, but the hearts system is very annoying and i prefer using the brother version whenever i can for that very reason."
duolingo,4,0,"otherwise, its a very fun engaging pp and in learning a lot!"
duolingo,4,0,mostly great.
duolingo,4,0,can't report bags.
duolingo,4,0,"i'm trying to report a bug, but the catch just takes me to some genetic goose page."
duolingo,4,0,"i earned promotion to gold, but still placed in silver."
duolingo,4,0,please help.
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp!
duolingo,4,0,it has been a great way for me to learn garlic!
duolingo,4,0,i do wish there was a tax for explanations of things like why the same word can be spelled different ways.
duolingo,4,0,"still, it's a great pp!"
duolingo,4,0,i recommend it all the time.
duolingo,4,0,its a really good pp overall but at times it gets stuck and i really have to start my phone to fix it.....otherwise i think its the best pp to learn different languages.😊
duolingo,4,0,"some languages are better than others, spanish needs a latin american version, hebrew needs more content and way more/better/slower audit, german is pretty good."
duolingo,4,0,great that it's free as are getting more annoying.
duolingo,4,0,i'm glad i have this to both review for my spanish courses and even learn irish garlic from my heritage.
duolingo,4,0,thank you developer!
duolingo,4,0,"i also appreciate the i, the only thing is i wish the domingo podcasts had a tax in the pp rather than a separate webpage."
duolingo,4,0,i wish it was more clear how one is supposed to be learning new material.
duolingo,4,0,i have taken 3 college level spanish classes so the initial testing is review for me.
duolingo,4,0,i don't understand how a beginner would learn the material enough to be able to effectively participate before making 5 mistakes and being done for the day in the free version.
duolingo,4,0,perhaps that's the point... but regardless i do really like the format of various ways to be repeat tested.
duolingo,4,0,"the services are great, but on my lawton there isn any heart count."
duolingo,4,0,that is the only thing i dont like about domingo on my mobile.
duolingo,4,0,just let us learn in peace whenever we want!
duolingo,4,0,i love it!
duolingo,4,0,i'm learning so much!
duolingo,4,0,only thing is that you run out of lives too fast and it takes to long for them to regenerate.
duolingo,4,0,over all good 👍😊
duolingo,4,0,very good experience.
duolingo,4,0,one improvement i would suggest is there be more questions where the student speaks spanish to the pp.
duolingo,4,0,that is my weakness and that is where i need more practice.
duolingo,4,0,"really great pp for free use, but they may need to review some of the rumania phrases."
duolingo,4,0,"""some girls are cleaner than others""."
duolingo,4,0,many fun and similar phrases to follow!
duolingo,4,0,"although many of the sentences dont make sense or are not useful for everyday life, the method is quite fun and soon you're learning a lot of any language."
duolingo,4,0,very recommendable!
duolingo,4,0,would've been great if you add latin.
duolingo,4,0,and also add an option wherein you look for someone to chat in order to practice your language.
duolingo,4,0,"and yeah, can you add a feature where we can save tips office?"
duolingo,4,0,that would be useful.
duolingo,4,0,"it could be more effective,do not repeat pretty easy exercises too often"
duolingo,4,0,nice pp lets you learn all sorts of languages but it spasm's you with all sorts of modifications
duolingo,4,0,experience has been smooth and fearless but the pp expects user to already know some words before you begin lesson.
duolingo,4,0,needs to have a sight word or dictionary before each lesson.
duolingo,4,0,but i like it a lot!
duolingo,4,0,wish i had found domingo sooner.
duolingo,4,0,"it's so convenient, easy to use and works"
duolingo,4,0,great application for learning and improving language levels.
duolingo,4,0,"really fun way to learn, arabic needs more improvement"
duolingo,4,0,domingo is fingering with the scores required to complete levels and they have broken it.
duolingo,4,0,"very frustration... oh, and the idea to 'crack' previously completed level 5 achievement's needs thinking."
duolingo,4,0,"it's the best pp to learn about understanding a language but not when it comes to learning the alphabet... if there was another tax for a list of all alphabet and the words learnt, it will become unbearable in all aspects..."
duolingo,4,0,supposed to help you learn a foreign language by repetition.
duolingo,4,0,there doesn seem to be any way of testing how you are doing.
duolingo,4,0,i e whether to are taking in the into in the different lessons.
duolingo,4,0,has reminded my desire to learn another language.
duolingo,4,0,like any tool though.
duolingo,4,0,"there's no substitute for actually using the language in real life, but it is great for revision and building knowledge"
duolingo,4,0,"excellent pp, but the referral code did not work - i sent it to a friend, he signed up to domingo but i did not receive one week of domingo plus for free."
duolingo,4,0,otherwise i would put 5 stars
duolingo,4,0,"i really like this pp because it covers reading, writing and speaking which is so helpful however it is very repetition going over easy words i already know."
duolingo,4,0,easy to use.
duolingo,4,0,some of the as are interesting.
duolingo,4,0,"modifications are unnecessary and annoying; because of them, i may have end up uninstalling the pp."
duolingo,4,0,it's a pretty good pp.
duolingo,4,0,it does however have some flaws.
duolingo,4,0,one of them being that they skin the basic words that are used in sentence structure.
duolingo,4,0,"overall, it's a very good pp."
duolingo,4,0,please fix sign in problem it doesn't let me sign in (has been fixed)
duolingo,4,0,very easy to use and learn from.
duolingo,4,0,it just dont have many explanations for the usage of words.
duolingo,4,0,except when you asked in the comments for others opinion.
duolingo,4,0,might be useful if they put how a word is used in grammar properly.
duolingo,4,0,domingo has helped me a lot with spanish.
duolingo,4,0,"you can learn a lot of vocabulary from it, but what i think is the best about this application, is that it provides daily practice, which is the most important thing for any language learner."
duolingo,4,0,"i have taken spanish in high school, two decades ago... again, conversational spanish as a ""continuing education"" course roughly a decade ago... so, i have experience with the language but not much useful practice... domingo is acting as a fantastic refreshed course for me as well as being easy to use and ultra convenient."
duolingo,4,0,"it was a fantastic application, very useful, easy to use, i enjoy by this experience but sometimes i answered the questions right and it says it wrong!!"
duolingo,4,0,!
duolingo,4,0,overall the pp is excellent.
duolingo,4,0,i think it could and should be one of the apes that you don't need to connect to internet for it will be nice for that otherwise great for kiss and adults.
duolingo,4,0,i love how learning a new language can be but the only problem i am having is when i use my freeze streak it didn't keep it and i use 200 to keep it.i am really unhappy about that but the rest of it i love.
duolingo,4,0,it's a really good pp.
duolingo,4,0,"the only thing i'd really like to be added is statistics, like how much time you've spent on specific languages, and a correct/incorrect ratio."
duolingo,4,0,"although it is fun to play this game, it wouldn't accept my correct answer in some lessons."
duolingo,4,0,this has occurred many times so i hope you will fix this.
duolingo,4,0,a nice pp.
duolingo,4,0,"somewhat repetition, but can move forward easily."
duolingo,4,0,should be some explanation of towel usage.
duolingo,4,0,"but, overall, enjoyable."
duolingo,4,0,"it is very educational and it helps teach me certain conjunction that i can never remember when writing in a french exam, however it is very repetition and it takes a while for someone to reach higher levels"
duolingo,4,0,"lessons move along a bit quick for me, need more time to learn the symbols(letters) new words are not well expressed before expecting you to know them."
duolingo,4,0,it's really helping me learn french.
duolingo,4,0,there are a lot of as though and when the parts run out then you can't use the pp anymore for 4 hours..
duolingo,4,0,i am learning and it's not boring.
duolingo,4,0,"it is real easy to take stupid mistakes, which i have done, but they will ask the same question again at the end to help you get it right."
duolingo,4,0,"every now and then something will pop up that i wasn't prepared for, but that's just part of the process."
duolingo,4,0,very educational and very fun it lets you learn a lot of different languages!
duolingo,4,0,however i gave it a four because of way too many adds however i recommend you download 😉
duolingo,4,0,i love this pp.
duolingo,4,0,the only complaint i have is that it wont let me change my goal from casual to anything eyes.
duolingo,4,0,everything eyes is awesome though.
duolingo,4,0,great pp.
duolingo,4,0,amazing pp but sometimes the formulation of the sentences seem weird and also in some cases they ask you to translate something and it is just a name that you have to write like : hallo hans > hello ...
duolingo,4,0,great pp!
duolingo,4,0,would recommend for those learning a language for fun.
duolingo,4,0,"however, the languages are mainly of formal usage and would recommend to add more casual form of communication"
duolingo,4,0,its nice trying to practice before a language test but it send a lot of email and modifications to my computer flogging it up
duolingo,4,0,this pp helps me learn really fast and i have option on how i last.
duolingo,4,0,"i learn better when i t is a game, not just reading and writing."
duolingo,4,0,here i have the story option as well.
duolingo,4,0,super easy to learn at a very fast pace!
duolingo,4,0,only issue is some of the pronunciation which are not clear enough to imitate.
duolingo,4,0,i am learning danish.
duolingo,4,1,i love this pp where you can learn any language you want but i don't understand why you can't continue learning if you run out of hearts but other than that they also have so many advertisements!
duolingo,4,1,"if you could,please stop putting so many advertisements and stop doing the heart thing."
duolingo,4,1,if you continue to do the lives and hearts it's just donna prove this is just a silly game.
duolingo,4,1,it just doesn't make sense how you stop learning things if you run out of hearts
duolingo,4,0,very good overall but seems to keep you at the very basic level for a long time.
duolingo,4,0,good tip is to use the key icon at start of topic lessons to gain a level instead of doing 5 lessons.
duolingo,4,0,"good lessons, a couple times i wasn't able to complete a lesson cut it would freeze up."
duolingo,4,0,so i didn't go on for a day or so and then it was back up.
duolingo,4,0,overall it's a great pp.
duolingo,4,0,easy to use.
duolingo,4,0,i like that fact you hear the pronunciation and then attempt yourself.
duolingo,4,0,would be better if you could go back and red lessons.
duolingo,4,0,i just get the hang of the words and i'm moved on to the next level.
duolingo,4,0,domingo so far has been very helpful in my learning experience.
duolingo,4,0,"i personally need a lot more practice with learning new things, and thanks to this pp, i can do that without burdening anyone else."
duolingo,4,0,amazing pp easy to use and has very many languages
duolingo,4,0,"i'd love to give 5 stars, but unfortunately i can't because certain practices for the language i'm learning (hind) are a little itchy and won't let me match things such as ""ham"" and ""कँ"",which makes it impossible for me to complete my tasks and continue my streaks or earn any ex."
duolingo,4,0,"i'm basically stuck all the time and can't move forwards, which is a pity."
duolingo,4,0,it is a really great learning pp if you ignore those (little) errors.
duolingo,4,0,it's great for me as a beginner in spanish just small note : it's not good in arabic.
duolingo,4,0,"and sometimes when i finish a lesson , it doesn't count that i did it."
duolingo,4,0,purely amazing!
duolingo,4,0,it is very helpful and even refreshed your newly acquired knowledge of the language.
duolingo,4,0,this is the perfect pp for learning a language.
duolingo,4,0,"seems helpful for learning language basis and not as annoying as it was years ago, so has improved since then."
duolingo,4,0,i like how it is more lenient toward spelling mistakes too now.
duolingo,4,0,great learning tool.
duolingo,4,0,really good consolidating practice.
duolingo,4,0,it doesn't seem to work with my microphone which is the only owner.
duolingo,4,0,it is sad that there is no feature to switch the default language.
duolingo,4,0,"my first language is russian but my phone is set to english, so the pp is also in english which makes it really inconvenient to learn."
duolingo,4,0,sometimes it is difficult to find the dictionary or background for the language on the pp.
duolingo,4,0,i have to go to the computer to check on how to use the pp's dictionary.
duolingo,4,0,other than that..it's an awesome learning experience.
duolingo,4,0,"it's a perfect pp to learn different languages, but unfortunately i can not have the listening(audit sections) anymore without any specific reason😔"
duolingo,4,0,"the occasional advertisements are annoying, other than that its a good pp for learning new languages; they could add some more languages; download it to learn punjabi but didn have it."
duolingo,4,0,"it's so useful but i have a major problem, none of the listening tracks play on my phone so i can't answer them, by the way i gave all the permission, what should i do?"
duolingo,4,0,fun and easy to learn.
duolingo,4,0,lots and lots of repetition makes it stick better.
duolingo,4,0,andros!
duolingo,4,0,it's amazing and free so i can't really complain.
duolingo,4,0,some paid services are of course better but you can't really go wrong with domingo.
duolingo,4,0,great experience overall.
duolingo,4,0,"would be excellent if we could ""go back"" to previous page (to review, realized the mistake we made or compare with current page) when doing lessons."
duolingo,4,0,great tool to help learn.
duolingo,4,0,i only wish some of the words would be defined a bit more via a definition.
duolingo,4,0,flash cards would be helpful.
duolingo,4,0,"sometimes the audit doesn't work, and you are left guessing what the answer is."
duolingo,4,0,this is the only issue in experienced.
duolingo,4,0,"other than that, it is an excellent way to learn a new language."
duolingo,4,0,"in my eyes, it would be more interesting if included vivid photo."
duolingo,4,0,moreover the sections of recording learner's voice should be improved.
duolingo,4,0,the pp is good.
duolingo,4,0,it could be better if more of the sounds were correct.
duolingo,4,0,if the sounds were all correct i would have given it 5 states.
duolingo,4,0,this makes learning another language fun and exciting and you can complete with others for prizes so it makes you want to learn.
duolingo,4,0,"great pp, loved the smooth experience."
duolingo,4,0,and the as don't bother me.
duolingo,4,0,also the language variety is astonishing!
duolingo,4,0,just lacking a bit in lesson quality.
duolingo,4,0,have been using this in parallel with my class.
duolingo,4,0,a good source for practise!
duolingo,4,0,the interface is well designed and the module structure is good..
duolingo,4,0,"very nice pp, with nice exercises."
duolingo,4,0,haven't spent to much time on it but so far it seems that it can provide a nice introduction to languages.
duolingo,4,0,this is very nice but my only problem is i can't find friends.
duolingo,4,0,i've tried their names and email yet it keeps saying no results found.
duolingo,4,0,still this is a great way to learn a language that you like.
duolingo,4,0,u have an easy access to learn any time u want to.
duolingo,4,0,so is learning friendly for everyone who have a little time to learn.
duolingo,4,0,and domingo keep you up to date and encourage you moving on.
duolingo,4,0,"the only problem is if you were interrupted in learning, you need to white until domingo let u get back in."
duolingo,4,0,it's frustration because i have grandkids kept interrupting me.
duolingo,4,0,got me interested in various languages and easy to see similarities.
duolingo,4,0,👍
duolingo,4,0,"overall i love this pp but, i wish you could have going lessons without using hearts or buying domingo plus"
duolingo,4,0,good pp but i wish it would explain more.
duolingo,4,0,you have to use more than just this pp for learning japanese at least.
duolingo,4,0,"just tells you the meaning but nothing about conjunction, verb forms , act."
duolingo,4,0,i'm having a great time learning a new language.
duolingo,4,0,i notice that some things aren't explained clearly.
duolingo,4,0,i really enjoy using this pp and the challenges it presents when learning a language.
duolingo,4,0,its a good pp but the only thing bad about it is the amount of hearts you have.
duolingo,4,0,i dont know if anyone else is having this problem but the pp wont let me sign into my account.
duolingo,4,0,very good for learning basic words and phrases but it struggles to convey grammar points and doesn't help you form rapid verbal structures.
duolingo,4,0,very good to have before entering a spanish class to get a head start
duolingo,4,0,"great pp, do recommend."
duolingo,4,0,but i would love it if your pp would puts modifications so much it might cause stress to some.
duolingo,4,0,also would you please try to learn pale please i want to know how to speak to my friend.
duolingo,4,1,"so far, domingo has been a great resource to review some basis that i was getting a little rusty on and has already introduced some new vocabulary that is helpful."
duolingo,4,0,"great pp and all, but whenever i try to sign in, it doesn't let me!"
duolingo,4,0,"i keep trying, and it just doesn't let me."
duolingo,4,0,"i hope that can be fixed, soon."
duolingo,4,0,really good pp.
duolingo,4,0,and i'm comfortable at my pace.
duolingo,4,0,i would have gone for plus without hesitation if the health shield and progress quit is available for andros too.
duolingo,4,0,it is a great pp and it is easy to learn from.
duolingo,4,0,i really enjoy using it.
duolingo,4,1,so far good.
duolingo,4,1,have to complete more levels to see what the results are.
duolingo,4,0,my boyfriend who is german was caught off guard when i told him good morning in german.
duolingo,4,0,"a few things here and there that aren't exactly translated right, but i'd like to think it's more of a difference in dialect."
duolingo,4,0,nice application to study languages but please do not change interface each week - this introduces new bags in the pp (i.e.
duolingo,4,0,"hearts refill sometimes is not applied, incorrect status of progress, etc)"
duolingo,4,0,"i love learning languages with domingo.. it's easy to use and understandable.. unfortunately, it use the same sentences for each category.. i hope it would have more diverse sentences in the future"
duolingo,4,0,it's a great pp.
duolingo,4,0,now!!!
duolingo,4,0,"i love it, very interesting to follow."
duolingo,4,0,reaches languages from the basis.
duolingo,4,0,and ensures one continues learning.
duolingo,4,0,"very fun and useful, but the as and the hearts mean you may only have the ability to play a few rounds before you are locked out."
duolingo,4,0,"amazing pp 😊but the only problem is with the stars ,it gets finish ,we."
duolingo,4,0,"can't practice for more time 😐 otherwise the pp is effective, good, and appreciative.... keep it up domingo 👍👌"
duolingo,4,0,"i've been taking the german course for years now, great pp."
duolingo,4,0,"that said, can you replace the male voice within that course?"
duolingo,4,0,i can barely hear what that must-mouth is saying
duolingo,4,0,easy to use.
duolingo,4,0,"a ""lesson"" takes only a few minutes to complete."
duolingo,4,0,pp could be improved by incorporating grammar instructions.
duolingo,4,0,i find this pp a very good tool to learn.
duolingo,4,0,"a lot of repetition, some extra competition to stay motivate."
duolingo,4,0,enjoying learning so far.
duolingo,4,0,keep plugging along and hope to improve.
duolingo,4,0,i think this pp is helping me to wrap my brain around spanish.
duolingo,4,0,i find it fun and just enough challenge to want to come back.
duolingo,4,0,the pp is free so is not as good as the pay ones which are way more accurate when teaching you a language.
duolingo,4,0,"but besides that, is amazing."
duolingo,4,0,i really recommend it.
duolingo,4,0,"it's a great pp and all, but there is this bug that won't let me continue to the next lesson for french."
duolingo,4,0,please fix this.
duolingo,4,0,"overall, it's a fun and educational process."
duolingo,4,0,great!
duolingo,4,0,"i wish there were more ""tips"" on sentence structure and sounds."
duolingo,4,0,also it would be nice for each new verb to see the conjugations
duolingo,4,0,overall it had been helpful.
duolingo,4,0,"though, i wish there was a section specifically for learning conversation and another for writing."
duolingo,4,0,i love domingo.
duolingo,4,0,but lately the audit parts of the lesson don't work properly.
duolingo,4,0,does anyone have the same problem?
duolingo,4,0,very intuition and helpful to learning.
duolingo,4,0,i think it would improve domingo if other languages like esthonia and finnish could be added.
duolingo,4,0,and maybe more regional dialect added of possible.
duolingo,4,0,bloody brilliant.
duolingo,4,0,more languages needed though.
duolingo,4,0,why suddenly the pp became unstable?
duolingo,4,0,"it masses up up points, days, the number of lessons done and leagues."
duolingo,4,0,it seems that the recent few updated made it work worst.
duolingo,4,0,"it's good to learn from this pp but it starts from the difficult which is not good from the beginner like me as there is no basis like introduction, asking names etc in initial levels,"
duolingo,4,0,"really enjoying this pp, i download it to learn scottish garlic and i'm picking up more than i thought i would."
duolingo,4,0,i might revise to 5 stars if i stop using it while i watch to ll.
duolingo,4,0,categorizing the essentials seems to be very good.
duolingo,4,0,i do not have access to listening and speaking tasks...
duolingo,4,0,love the service.
duolingo,4,0,please make all voices sound the same volume.
duolingo,4,0,i have to keep raising and increasing the volume frequently.
duolingo,4,0,well its a very good learning language pp but why its audit and its mid doesn work for me?
duolingo,4,0,if this problem get solved then i would like to give u 5 star!
duolingo,4,0,thank u :)
duolingo,4,0,very few stitches and the voices are clear most of the time.
duolingo,4,0,i am enjoying the learning experience
duolingo,4,0,this is great pp to learn any where any time like enjoying the game.
duolingo,4,0,"great pp, but it would be perfect if you'd add the grammar explanations and stories in the other languages besides german, french, english etc."
duolingo,4,0,it's very practical to learn a new language.
duolingo,4,0,but very basic and there is not an introduction about some rules of the language.
duolingo,4,0,for ex.
duolingo,4,0,"numbers, days of the week, etc."
duolingo,4,0,"i'm really liking the way it allows me to check that, i'm getting the understanding of what i'm saying and, the pronunciation of each word so that i am not sounding like a nut ✌"
duolingo,4,0,i used this pp for about one week and i got the highest score in arabic meanwhile in every level they constantly repeat the question.i got sick of it.although this is a nice pp for learning.
duolingo,4,0,i'm thrilled that there is a free pp for learning a language with such a smooth interface.
duolingo,4,0,i do wish it would challenge me a little faster though.
duolingo,4,0,great pp.
duolingo,4,0,"but in learning arabic the font of assignment is very small, difficult to read, especially for a beginner."
duolingo,4,0,"a good, free option to practice another language."
duolingo,4,0,"best if used as a supplement to a bigger, more flushed out course."
duolingo,4,0,that's awesome 😍 but the pp doesn't level up me though i regularly practice so i suppose st goes wrong and actually the speaker doesn't work out properly especially lately as a result irritating 😒
duolingo,4,0,i really like the different exercises.
duolingo,4,0,i'm just not sure if i am progressing at an appropriate rate since there really isn't any feedback.
duolingo,4,0,i really enjoy this pp.
duolingo,4,0,"it's almost like playing a game, but i'm learning a language!"
duolingo,4,0,thanks!
duolingo,4,0,very good.
duolingo,4,0,.....except that sometimes has problem with its audit system.
duolingo,4,0,other than that its amazing .😊😊
duolingo,4,0,"the sound doesn't work properly most of the times unfortunately☹, unless the application is awesome"
duolingo,4,0,really enjoyable - pity it does not do british english and castillian spanish
duolingo,4,0,easy to use.
duolingo,4,0,too bad are no explanations about the grammar.
duolingo,4,0,"overall, i love it."
duolingo,4,0,would be easier though if there was european portuguese because it's not the same as brazilian.
duolingo,4,8,update (long time user) less stitches but letters are now smaller and hard to see.
duolingo,4,8,same with the color yellow on the highlight words.
duolingo,4,8,otherwise good pp.
duolingo,4,0,excellent free language learning pp!
duolingo,4,0,i give it 4 stars hoping that domingo will upgrade to include more verbal skill.
duolingo,4,0,currently the focus seems to be reading and writing.
duolingo,4,0,after the last update the pp sometimes doesn' t count your progress.
duolingo,4,0,also in somehow losing the gems by no means.
duolingo,4,0,please fix this.
duolingo,4,0,otherwise the pp is great.
duolingo,4,0,it's great but could be better.
duolingo,4,0,"removing the practice button, for example, gives the pp less stars."
duolingo,4,0,"has lots of good and correct languages but some of the sentences you learn will not be something you would actually use like "" ana likes the color blue."""
duolingo,4,0,i like the pp just don't like that it cuts you off after such a short time.
duolingo,4,0,and some of the languages aren't that basic for beginner.
duolingo,4,0,good pp.... i would prefer if the pp had an explaining feature towards grammar/vocal so i could better understand why the words are in the order that they are etc.
duolingo,4,0,great pp for learning the basis.
duolingo,4,0,"many language option, but missing the one that i am currently trying to learn with couture video and would rather learn with this."
duolingo,4,0,please add finnish sometime soon.
duolingo,4,0,kits!
duolingo,4,0,i updated my pp but there is no sound for vocal quires when u tape the sound tape
duolingo,4,0,the paid version does offer a little more in terms of ease of use compared with the premium and helps to support a community of earners.
duolingo,4,0,"great pp, really helpful 😉 don't think the hearts are necessary though."
duolingo,4,0,don't always have time to get them.
duolingo,4,0,personally i think that they are useless 😤
duolingo,4,1,great pp for familiarization with a language.
duolingo,4,1,"nothing better than immersion though, but appreciate that they are starting to create such immersion option."
duolingo,4,0,i find speaking everything out loud helps a lot.
duolingo,4,0,i repeat difficult (to me) words over and over after repeatedly listening to the prompt.
duolingo,4,0,"very good learning experience, although i would recommend adding a feature that reads every sentence/phrase to you so as to familiarity users with the sounds that letters make"
duolingo,4,0,great way to start learning a new language.
duolingo,4,0,"it would be even better if it had a writing practice too, instead of just word order."
duolingo,4,0,this pp has helped me a lot in practicing and learning organ!
duolingo,4,0,this also has a lot of languages so i'm sure it will help a lot of people!
duolingo,4,0,i will definitely give it a very big thumbs up!!!
duolingo,4,0,:)
duolingo,4,0,"it helps me memories everything really well, it's an amazing pp"
duolingo,4,0,"it's a great pp, but the japanese course always seems to lose the option to use the keyboard for tying japanese words."

duolingo,4,0,i have enjoyed using this pp to learn new languages.
duolingo,4,0,the pp is very interactive making the learning experience very enjoyable.

duolingo,4,0,lacks stories and other features available on different platforms.
duolingo,4,0,"good pp, sometimes sticks a bit mostly good."
duolingo,4,0,easy to do.
duolingo,4,0,and having lived in spain seems to be consistent with what i have already learned.

duolingo,4,0,bow it's pretty helpful.
duolingo,4,0,very easy to learn if you have the time and eagerness.
duolingo,4,0,above average to excellent.
duolingo,4,0,to have a free pp that drills one in a language is quite excellent.
duolingo,4,0,"there are a few bags (greek), but overall an pp i heartily recommend."
duolingo,4,0,"very good pp to start, the voice recognition feature is awesome, still have some little errors but its kind of playing style makes it funny to learn"
duolingo,4,0,this is a really great pp for studying a new language but can you add the feature to change the method input when answering like in the web version because i think answering with tying is give me better understanding than word bank
duolingo,4,0,useful phrases and words presented in multiple ways at any time i find convenient.
duolingo,4,0,lessons can last as long or short as i determine .
duolingo,4,0,"the pp is great, my only complaint is that they took out the testing feature in one of the new updated."
duolingo,4,0,otherwise it's awesome.
duolingo,4,0,"i like it you are able to learn new languages, though they makes you repeat everything over and over which makes it boring and it's only a few minutes in a day."

duolingo,4,0,"sometimes it just expects you to know new words, and i had to goose them."
duolingo,4,0,"this pp seems absolutely amazing at teaching new languages, though the hearts do seem a bit limiting, because people do make mistakes in learning so only having 5 is not much, but besides that amazing job"
duolingo,4,0,i love everything about this pp.
duolingo,4,0,i hope to see the those language offered on here in the near future.
duolingo,4,1,i spend 10-20 min a night learning german.
duolingo,4,1,this pp is pretty easy and entertaining 4 days into it and i'm confident enough to order bread and water or should i say trot und passed.
duolingo,4,0,i lost my 141 day streak because i was super busy and i didn't even have the time to check and buy the streak save.
duolingo,4,0,now i have installed it.
duolingo,4,0,you should have provided a better way to save the streak for busy people.
duolingo,4,0,anything you can do about multiple people logging points on the leagues?
duolingo,4,0,there are some people who are obviously abusing the system!

duolingo,4,0,"it's a bit of a shame that there's no dark mode feature, bright light strains my eyes and makes it harder to learn things."
duolingo,4,0,a dark theme for the pp would be a nice future feature.
duolingo,4,0,good pp but missing a lot of the functionality of the webster though.
duolingo,4,0,no dictionary/stories.
duolingo,4,0,also pp can get quite itchy sometimes and crash.
duolingo,4,0,close to perfection... it has helped me a lot in learning a second language.
duolingo,4,0,i recommend it to anyone who wants to teach themselves another language
duolingo,4,0,great pp for learning spanish.
duolingo,4,0,my only qualms is that sometimes your lesson doesn't get saved if you have to leave it for a while and come back to it later in the day.
duolingo,4,0,that can be very frustration.
duolingo,4,0,"user friendly and attempts to cover many aspects of learning a language, oral, written, comprehension and translation."
duolingo,4,0,tips section is different and much less elaborate than in the web version.
duolingo,4,0,so for theory i always go to the webster.
duolingo,4,0,why to strip out all the useful material from the pp?
duolingo,4,0,domingo is great to use if you are an aid traveler.
duolingo,4,0,i like the easy set up and daily reminders.
duolingo,4,0,"if you are trying to learn a language, domingo is free, try it."
duolingo,4,0,"for some reason they make a louse japanese course, not even covering all the hiring and giving zero lessons for katakana which is essential to learning japanese... you need to have some kind of rd party study aid for these and other asia courses if you want to learn them in depth and not just play a game (>.>) be it a text book, character chart, etc, which is totally unnecessary."
duolingo,4,0,"there are better apes for asia but if you're interested in a european language, this application is a must have!"

duolingo,4,0,the progress is saved but i can't redeem anything...😢
duolingo,4,0,"very enjoyable, although i wish i could backtrack to a previous screen and i wish all the questions came with audit."
duolingo,4,0,i've just tried this recently to learn organ.
duolingo,4,0,"i already have some previous knowledge and this is helping me a lot to know better, but i didn't know there were tips and notes, i wouldn't know if i didn't read in the comments."
duolingo,4,0,can you make this available for the mobile pp too?
duolingo,4,0,"this pp really help me learn a new language, other than school this helped me way more."

duolingo,4,0,"fun and adjective way to learn a language, but if you're serious about becoming client, be sure to have at least one other method of learning, such as pimsleur or roseola stone."
duolingo,4,0,domingo is a great pp for learning a new language but you have to pay in order to continue learning without any interruption like hearts or as.
duolingo,4,0,nice pp funny and useful but the voice tests sometimes said i am wrong i don't know why because of accent or what.
duolingo,4,0,"while explanations of grammatical rules could be more complete and organized, do is well set to encourage the practice required for language acquisition."

duolingo,4,0,it helps with good didactics!
duolingo,4,0,wish the tips were linked directly to the exercises instead of in a separate screen and that the pp had the tips as the webster does.
duolingo,4,0,on the andros platform the pp has recently started to crash 60% of the time.
duolingo,4,0,it is extremely annoying.
duolingo,4,0,the programme itself is brilliant stars

duolingo,4,0,!👍

duolingo,4,0,"nice application, but if you can collect the new words after every stage in one place will be perfect"
duolingo,4,0,interesting and super efficient... i've learnt so much in such a short time

duolingo,4,0,good pp but voices sometime not clear..

duolingo,4,0,is great but paid version.
duolingo,4,0,free isn't the best because after you make a few mistakes it won't let you progress til next day

duolingo,4,0,requires a little research outside of the pp to progress in some of the lessons.

duolingo,4,0,one of the most interesting ways to learn a game
duolingo,4,0,this pp is great!!
duolingo,4,0,but.... the one thing that others me are the hearts/lives.
duolingo,4,0,mistakes shouldn be ashamed with -1 heart.
duolingo,4,0,"yeah, other than that it's really good."
duolingo,4,0,"great, but sometimes there is no audit or a correct answer is considered incorrect."
duolingo,4,0,i love the game but whenever you lose all your hearts and you dont have enough gems the only option is to quit the lesson and start the whole entire lesson pus make a update so you dont need to start the whole lesson bow i'm learning organ for the first time
duolingo,4,0,really efficient!
duolingo,4,0,i love it.

duolingo,4,0,domingo is available whenever you are.
duolingo,4,0,it can move with excruciating slowness but that makes signs of progress more exciting.
duolingo,4,0,lessons are very precise and easy to follow.

rosettastone,4,1,"so far its a great pp their are clot of option to choose from and you get the first core lessons free before having to purchase anything not, only that but it is actually really helpful with being able to hear the word rather than just reading it and the fact that if you get some words wrong you dont have to worry about starting the whole lesson over there is an option to go back through once you finish to fix any mistakes, they also put the words you struggle with in to a revision lesson"
rosettastone,4,4,pp wont work with andros device?
rosettastone,4,4,"- samson galaxy 8 i'd love to provide a 5 star review, but as technical support doesn't seem to be able to get my account to work on andros devices (which is what i have) i can use the product i purchased."

rosettastone,4,2,"when trying to say it back to them, you end up shouting at your phone and yet they tell you ""we are having trouble hearing you."""
rosettastone,4,2,"i completely understand that audit is hard to get into an pp, i just think the audit could be improved slightly."
rosettastone,4,2,"this review is not for hate on the creator, i just think improvement is needed in some places - which is okay!"
rosettastone,4,2,thanks!
rosettastone,4,8,i wish the program had the words written in my native language too with the pictures so i will have a better understanding what the pictures meant.
rosettastone,4,8,some of the pictures i have problems with firing them out what they really meant.
rosettastone,4,8,"examples.. i sometimes have a hard time making the pictures out of it's a man for women, boy or girl, what are the person or persons are doing in the picture."
rosettastone,4,8,but overall it's an good program.
rosettastone,4,7,"well, for states...ask me every three mind to rate the pp when i've barely used it?"
rosettastone,4,7,at times the voice recognition says i was perfect when i definitely want.
rosettastone,4,7,"otherwise, great set for learning."
rosettastone,4,7,"a bit more of having me speak it would be better, it's only about 10% of the content so far....but this might be a reason not to ask incessantly for a rating."
rosettastone,4,0,very good but moves fast.
rosettastone,4,0,i don't know how the absolute beginner can keep up.
rosettastone,4,0,"otherwise , recommend ."
rosettastone,4,5,i wonder what developer improved in the program for last 12 years since i tried it last time.
rosettastone,4,5,"it still uncomfortable if you know language a bit, mostly because of very slow progress, you can do times faster with books."
rosettastone,4,5,pp is buggy and is not adopted to wide screen resolutions so you almost cannot use it.
rosettastone,4,5,lack of portrait mode for comfortable experience.
rosettastone,4,5,"bags in programs, but there is no handy button to report current slide."
rosettastone,4,0,i'm older and find a little difficult to see some of the clues in the pictures on my cell.
rosettastone,4,0,otherwise it is a good pp.
rosettastone,4,10,i love it!
rosettastone,4,10,now i can practice my language skill more!
rosettastone,4,10,i'd totally recommend for others to try to learn from this pp!
rosettastone,4,10,you can actually learn to speak other languages as they masses on your pronunciation.
rosettastone,4,10,so you would know that if you didn't pronounce a certain word correctly.
rosettastone,4,10,i'm a student though and i can't afford to pay for the full package.
rosettastone,4,10,so i'm using it for free.
rosettastone,4,10,i wish you'd have some kind of discount for students though.
rosettastone,4,10,or maybe a promotion.
rosettastone,4,78,"it is bit tough to get it going first, but once you get used to the system and how it works, i believe that it is quite effective in conversational practice."
rosettastone,4,78,"however, i wish that it can provide bit more depth translation of the words."
rosettastone,4,78,i am currently using goose translator to look up few words which can be confusing while learning.
rosettastone,4,78,but so far so good.
rosettastone,4,1,"it's fixed, but that was weird."
rosettastone,4,1,same here the program today started to pitch i cannot access my plan.
rosettastone,4,1,i had to sign in again and looks like all my progress saved is gone.
rosettastone,4,1,"also the audit was struggling to use either with wired headphones, bluetooth or just my phone microphone."
rosettastone,4,1,are.
rosettastone,4,1,it's stuck in office mode.
rosettastone,4,4,"st core lesson is great, but spoken voice is much too fast."
rosettastone,4,4,"this, coming from someone who lived in soul, s. more for 3 years."
rosettastone,4,4,"i still read tongue bluntly, write semi-client, & remember the basic phrases (& few bad words)."
rosettastone,4,4,i spoke semi-client 18-20 yes ago.
rosettastone,4,4,"without this knowledge, i would've been completely lost with the speed of speech."
rosettastone,4,4,and i'm pretty sure the tongue common vernacular has change slightly in the last couple decades.
rosettastone,4,4,still enjoying though.
rosettastone,4,4,5 stars for slower speech.
rosettastone,4,77,"it spends a long enough time on each lesson that it sticks, lots of different exercises which, & cool pronunciation rating my biggest grip is the lack of explanations."
rosettastone,4,77,"i wish they gave some background on the words, id like to be told how the grammar changes, the actual rules effecting the changes, and if the super literal translation is different from the regular convoy translation of it."
rosettastone,4,77,"but overall, pretty solid, and the pp is smooth and works well, easy to use."
rosettastone,4,2,"the surface is great the several methods of learning are helpful and i feel like it helps with growth in the language, one thing it could benefit from is specific topic points so you can search for the type of learning you want, i.e biblical, historical, it could be taught by translating a story with images."
rosettastone,4,1,got 3 months of italian for €39 (without live tutoring).
rosettastone,4,1,i really like the no-translation orientation of roseola stone.
rosettastone,4,1,i find it's helped me a great deal to write things down.
rosettastone,4,1,there are no specific grammar theory lessons as most things tend to make perfect sense with this conceptual learning approach.
rosettastone,4,1,it does help to goose a few things though.
rosettastone,4,1,"beware however: while speech recognition works a treat on my phone (honor 9), it's pretty horrendous on my malbrook for some reason."
rosettastone,4,0,for a 12 year old this is pretty fun it gives you many ways to learn and it pretty easy to i am trying to learn japanese
rosettastone,4,0,"the pp is really good, well, designed with good interface and tools."
rosettastone,4,0,"however, i mess some guidance on what we are really learning on each slide."
rosettastone,4,0,"i think if they highlight the variation in the gene, conjunction or whatever, it would be a little bit better."
rosettastone,4,2,"i haven't gotten far into the program, but i really like it so far."
rosettastone,4,2,though i'd prefer it to allow me time to translate what i just said before it moved on.
rosettastone,4,2,"the program kind pushes you through really fast, which is nice."
rosettastone,4,2,"you just have to go back to the lessons you didn't pass, even though it pips the next one up."
rosettastone,4,1,"there is a free version with limited use and adds, it will bug you to buy the premium thing but you dont have to."
rosettastone,4,1,"it asks you your level of the language, what type of things you want to be learning (whether its the basis or tourist language)."
rosettastone,4,1,"it judges your pronunciation and asks you to repeat things, as well as flash cards with visual and hearing and spelling."
rosettastone,4,1,"it will give you new words without a definition, but your allowed to look at the translation."
rosettastone,4,1,really great over all
rosettastone,4,1,it's a nice pp to learn the basis about a new language.
rosettastone,4,1,the only disadvantage i have about it is that you don't have a real translation and pictures what the words/sentences mean.
rosettastone,4,3,"it was a fun association way of learning that is easy to understand and keep up with, but it isn't all that great at picking up audit which may just be the fault of my personal device rather than the pp."
rosettastone,4,3,over all fun and easy.
rosettastone,4,3,👍
rosettastone,4,0,"i like how it helps breaks the words down, and uses pictures, but it would be great if their was more definition as to what the words are translated into english"
rosettastone,4,2,i wish it made more of an emphasis on the grammar.
rosettastone,4,2,coming from english we have a structure from the basis.
rosettastone,4,2,"need a little more theory in there, otherwise, i like it"
rosettastone,4,0,very good.
rosettastone,4,0,"sometimes has trouble hearing me even if i talk directly into the phone, but this doesn't happen often."
rosettastone,4,5,"great, but after almost completing the first beginning session, it cleared everything and now in back at the very beginning."
rosettastone,4,5,i hope this does not happen again :-(
rosettastone,4,1,this is amazing.
rosettastone,4,1,i only used the in free trial and have already learned so much.
rosettastone,4,1,i am definitely going to be looking into the full course to prepare for a philippines mission trip.
rosettastone,4,1,very good.
rosettastone,4,1,occasional stitches but always fixed quickly.
rosettastone,4,1,well worth the money.
rosettastone,4,16,lessons are interactive.
rosettastone,4,16,learning is more intuition than traditional lessons.
rosettastone,4,16,the best part is the pp lets you practice the sentences after you have used them to match the pictures.
rosettastone,4,2,"excellent, but needs an option to rest all lessons, not just one at a time which is too cumbersome when wanting to start after a period away"
rosettastone,4,0,so far so good.
rosettastone,4,0,it uses repetition to help understand the language.
rosettastone,4,0,the pp is also easy to use.
rosettastone,4,0,it's really good for pronunciation and gets you speaking fast
rosettastone,4,2,everytime i close the pp on my phone it removed the plan i was doing and then i have to start up the plan again when i open the pp again.
rosettastone,4,2,"other than that, great pp."
rosettastone,4,1,familiar with the pp since desktop!
rosettastone,4,1,"great job, great way to learn."
rosettastone,4,1,although had some minor bags during plan selection.
rosettastone,4,1,it's good but the english translation to the phrases will help people learn faster along with the pictures
rosettastone,4,0,have some bags with timing.
rosettastone,4,0,body is really clean and easy to learn languages thou it.
rosettastone,4,1,i love this program.
rosettastone,4,1,the exercises are interesting and helpful.
rosettastone,4,1,it's like i am playing a game but learning a language!
rosettastone,4,0,in the past you could slow the pronunciation.
rosettastone,4,0,if this is enabled i rate all stars.
rosettastone,4,0,"just started..wish i could tell it when to stop listening..after i say ""ll come"" if there background noise the mid will just stay on forever..wish i could stop the mid after i speak"
rosettastone,4,0,great pp.
rosettastone,4,0,fun learning experience.
rosettastone,4,0,what exactly is palmar paying for though.
rosettastone,4,0,i could have download this without the guild education system giving me a link to download the free pp.
rosettastone,4,0,it would be better if it was completely free and had adds instead of paying for lessons and you could just pay to remove adds
rosettastone,4,0,this is a really good pp!
rosettastone,4,0,i haunt memories clot yet but it is probably because it is my first day.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish it would have the english words to match.
rosettastone,4,0,so then i would know what i'm saying.
rosettastone,4,0,but so far so good!
rosettastone,4,1,"i love roseola stones approach to teaching languages, but found it a bit too difficult at the beginning (started learning arabic)."
rosettastone,4,3,"as good as can be expected with a cell phone, in terms of voice recognition and technology functionality."
rosettastone,4,0,it's easy to comprehend but it also throws curveballs at you once in a while to try to throw you off
rosettastone,4,0,the pp is great.
rosettastone,4,0,i would give 5 stars when my script settings (hiraganas) will be saved so i don't have kansas when i re open the pp :'(
rosettastone,4,1,love it but personally would rather with the basic lessons also repeating back in my language but otherwise fantastic pp.
rosettastone,4,0,its great and the apes seems to be working well.
rosettastone,4,0,i am trying the trial and i have decided that i want to get it for my family and myself.
rosettastone,4,0,it's very helpful when you are last-minute and need to learn quickly.
rosettastone,4,0,i am amazed at how well the pp recognizes voice and french language skill.
rosettastone,4,1,it is awesomingly amazing!
rosettastone,4,1,quickest way of learning and understanding a new language.
rosettastone,4,0,completely comprehensive!
rosettastone,4,0,my only regret is that we can't learn multiple languages simultaneously!
rosettastone,4,0,some trouble with the mid but that's part for the course with this phone so not the apes fault
rosettastone,4,0,just finished the first lesson but it seems good.
rosettastone,4,0,"i wish they gave definitions rather than pictures only, but we'll see what happens."
rosettastone,4,0,"cannot download, just gets stuck on download pending for all eternity edit: it's working now, good pp"
rosettastone,4,0,really good for written and choice but it doesn't recognise speech on the pp very well
rosettastone,4,0,very nice pattern to learn any new language.
rosettastone,4,0,i can say it's best.
rosettastone,4,0,so far so good.
rosettastone,4,0,just a lot of memorization and no real learning to memories.
rosettastone,4,0,"maybe they way they present the questions slowly does that, ink."
rosettastone,4,0,so far so good.
rosettastone,4,0,starting with basis to refresh my knowledge and get comfortable speaking spanish again.
rosettastone,4,0,"like the repetition and learning enhancements, as well as pace."
rosettastone,4,0,"easy, very customisable and free plan does just fine"
rosettastone,4,1,great pp takes u step by step in each lesson.
rosettastone,4,1,its a great learning tool
rosettastone,4,0,i like it.
rosettastone,4,0,it makes it easier because you are actually speaking the language
rosettastone,4,0,mostly good only issue that i'm having is occasionally the pp/ or phone is not picking up what i say
rosettastone,4,0,i'm learning arabic but there's different dialect in arabic wish they had them but still pretty easy to use
rosettastone,4,0,"it's very helpful,i'm moving in a few days and this really helps me learn a new language"
rosettastone,4,0,.oh only wish in could lean the english version of it in order to know what the word connection are.
rosettastone,4,0,interactive and fun but sometimes it clashes
rosettastone,4,1,it very good learning apes but the in pp price is high pus make it 10$ for a month otherwise it's a good pp
rosettastone,4,4,the pp so far is very helpful.
rosettastone,4,4,some issues with mapping things and delays trying to hear certain things again.
rosettastone,4,4,"on some of the speaking activities it refuses to play the statement again, and on some activities it is playing the statement for the first picture twice and not the first then second picture."
rosettastone,4,4,"so few minor bags, but the pp is helpful if you can get by those!"
rosettastone,4,4,goodluck!
rosettastone,4,5,aug 19 - given 4 stars as sometimes voice recognition isn't accurate.
rosettastone,4,5,also please add the games available on the computer available in the pp also?
rosettastone,4,5,update nov 19 - in 3 months i have improved my vocabulary a lot.
rosettastone,4,5,great to now be able to access stories/record my voice reading but there's a pitch on playback as the highlight select random word left to right when hebrew is read right to left so doesn't correlate at all.
rosettastone,4,5,"also, please make the desktop games available on the pp!"
rosettastone,4,0,so far so good.
rosettastone,4,0,just got the pp (2 days into it) and no issues.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish they ask if i like it 3 months from when i got it so i can give a good honest review : )
rosettastone,4,0,suddenly unable to log in to the andros pp
rosettastone,4,0,free lesson is great but u have to pay for other lessons.
rosettastone,4,0,but its good though.
rosettastone,4,88,"the pp is very professional and reaches you many phrases from the beginning, but can be challenging at the start too."
rosettastone,4,88,for example with organ you may struggle to pass the core lesson with ease but with languages such as french it is much easier.
rosettastone,4,88,"if you need to learn a language fast and easily, i would recommend this pp over lots of others."
rosettastone,4,88,thank you roseola stone for making learning languages much easier and accessible.
rosettastone,4,0,i'm in pursuit of a good language learning pp.
rosettastone,4,0,i can tell you that this pp is by far the most promising one.
rosettastone,4,3,pretty good so far.
rosettastone,4,3,honestly only used it for about an hour but so far in learning japanese i'm enjoying it and its pushing me to pronounce from the get go.
rosettastone,4,3,i like that because it shows the relationship between the characters.
rosettastone,4,3,i'll try to complete all my lessons and come out of it speaking a lot more or at least being able to read mania.
rosettastone,4,0,quality pp so far.
rosettastone,4,0,not as fun as other language apes that i've tried.
rosettastone,4,6,"i managed to get a reasonable price for a 6 month subscription for the 2 languages i am learning, and have been using the pp for a few days now and enjoying it a lot."
rosettastone,4,6,"i think for languages with a non organized script (like in my case greek and chinese) a bit of previous work elsewhere is needed (in my case with domingo and lingodeer) before using roseola, and maybe a source for consulting grammar points, but with those caverns, roseola is excellent for improving listening and pronunciation."
rosettastone,4,3,"i appreciate how the pp is trying to engage the user with speech, pictures, and sounds."
rosettastone,4,3,but i wish their was an auditory only component i could do in the car.
rosettastone,4,3,"and if there's too much background noise, then the pp incorrectly marks wrong my pronunciation."
rosettastone,4,3,genius!
rosettastone,4,3,"adding pictures and pronunciation is probably what makes this pp so successful, one top of that the structure of learning is very good."
rosettastone,4,3,i can feel my brain making associations.
rosettastone,4,3,strangest thing but beautiful to recognise.
rosettastone,4,3,no english even needed!
rosettastone,4,2,"i like it, but i don't care for how it doesn't explain anything."
rosettastone,4,2,"i prefer flung for that reason, though i do understand it is just a different way of learning."
rosettastone,4,2,i just prefer having an english explanation for some things.
rosettastone,4,0,"so far, so good."
rosettastone,4,0,"just started, but this seems the best pp i have found so far to learn italian."
rosettastone,4,2,had some issues with the pronunciation.
rosettastone,4,2,wish it had an easier way to learn how to say words like break it down using the english alphabet for us english speakers learning a new language that uses characters instead of letters
rosettastone,4,8,"i started learning japanese a few months ago , and so far so good."
rosettastone,4,8,the lessons are taught in a manner where you see your language you want to learn in its foreign writing.
rosettastone,4,8,also pictures to help you associate the words better.
rosettastone,4,8,"you are grade by a green wheel on how well you pronounce , and a green check if you pick the right picture to the words you are trying to learn."
rosettastone,4,8,overall this is a good practice pp to go along with a more well rounded curriculum.
rosettastone,4,8,my advice would be to get lessons from coley
rosettastone,4,10,i love it so far.
rosettastone,4,10,the interface is very easy to use and the lessons agent very in-your-face about whether or not you get the answer right.
rosettastone,4,10,i love that it has software to help practice pronunciation.
rosettastone,4,10,just making sure i know i'm saying everything correctly has been a big help.
rosettastone,4,10,if i could recommend something to make the pp better i would say to put in more grammar stuff.
rosettastone,4,10,"it would be immensely helpful if i had to construct the entire sentence itself, so that i could speak as i write."
rosettastone,4,20,i like how it helps with the pronunciation.
rosettastone,4,20,that said some of the sentences the pp wants you to repeat are a little long for me to remember all the sounds and correct tongue positions.
rosettastone,4,20,i wish there was a setting where i could just work on individual words first or putting 2 maybe 3 words together.
rosettastone,4,20,how this is set up can be rather greeting or intense.
rosettastone,4,20,this pp isn't really a good one to start with for the casual learner.
rosettastone,4,20,i use it in conjunction with 2 other flash card type apes.
rosettastone,4,0,so far this is so much fun.
rosettastone,4,0,like playing fun game while you learn .
rosettastone,4,0,a little prices but helps a lot.
rosettastone,4,0,it was an easy way to learn but have to be specific.
rosettastone,4,0,it's fun to learn wish it were a little bit more free
rosettastone,4,13,i love this pp and i'm really learning.
rosettastone,4,13,the only thing that others me is that i have completed one of the sections multiple times and it will not pass me and it says that its completed.
rosettastone,4,13,which i know sounds minor but every time i log it it takes me right back to several lessons ago and i have to skin.
rosettastone,4,13,it's very annoying.
rosettastone,4,7,it's really good!
rosettastone,4,7,i think that it helps with you truly understanding the word.
rosettastone,4,7,"they have different languages, and it does cost money, but their are free classes which i think are great."
rosettastone,4,7,"they work on how to say it, makes sure you don't get mixed up with different words, and they cover different words"
rosettastone,4,8,"the pace is really good for learning new words, and the voice recognition is really accurate."
rosettastone,4,8,"i wish it taught more of a lesson plan sometimes on why words are different, like masculine or feminine adjective."
rosettastone,4,8,"it worked well for firing it out, but it's not always clear on (for example) why some sentences use des and others de."
rosettastone,4,36,it has an amazing teaching style that is not found in many of the other language learning apes such as domingo and lingvist.
rosettastone,4,36,"however, the full version is a steep one time fee of $199 or a monthly subscription of $18 which is why i'm giving it 4 stars."
rosettastone,4,36,"still, very well made and possibly worth the full monetary investment."
rosettastone,4,7,"it is pretty great, expect for the fact that you have to kind guess what the picture is saying."
rosettastone,4,7,"i only just started so i don't know if it just tells you after the first course, if it stays, is there a way to turn something on in the beginning so you know what you are talking about."
rosettastone,4,49,i'd give this a 3.5 but that's not an option 🙃 however!
rosettastone,4,49,this is the best language learning pp/software that i have come across hands down.
rosettastone,4,49,now femme break it down nice and simple.
rosettastone,4,49,"pro's - prima language learning technique (the language ""click"" rather than having to memories) - visual aids combined with text/audit work very well together con's - speaking software stitches frequently across multiple devices - i feel that there is too much influx of new material before memory exercises"
rosettastone,4,0,its helping me learn the language.the only negative feedback i can say is that there is no english translation so i have to search a lot of words or sentence to completely understand a phrase or sentence.
rosettastone,4,10,i have been using the pp for many months.
rosettastone,4,10,i didn't even realize how much i learned until i started taking a class through a continuing education program.
rosettastone,4,10,once in a while i have had problems with speech recognition.
rosettastone,4,10,the one downside is there is no explanation on verb forms.
rosettastone,4,10,i wish they had a lesson on verbs only.
rosettastone,4,54,pp gives you the opportunity to follow daily lesson plans to expand your vocabulary each week.
rosettastone,4,54,does a good job of showing the different conjugations and gender variations of words.
rosettastone,4,54,"although most of the new words can be understood with context clues, i wish the pp offered a translation dictionary to double check yourself."
rosettastone,4,54,"also, in spanish, i wish it better explained formal vs. informal word usage and synonymous words."
rosettastone,4,54,"for instance, when to use tu vs. used and her vs. star."
rosettastone,4,0,i am enjoying the pp very much!
rosettastone,4,0,it is very information and the interactiveness just takes it to another level!
rosettastone,4,44,it's so easy to learn using the pp!
rosettastone,4,44,i also have roseola stone installed on my computer as well but the pp works much better.
rosettastone,4,44,the only downside is that on my computer download there's a section to practice writing the words and i don't have that on the pp.
rosettastone,4,44,other than that i have no complaints at all.
rosettastone,4,3,i have the then £300 copy for pp and want particularly happy when the pp came along and required further payment to take the experience mobile.
rosettastone,4,3,"however, the pp is very good and the way they teach is great."
rosettastone,4,3,the pp is pretty much lawless but sometimes has issues with office content.
rosettastone,4,13,a really good pp to help with your pronunciation.
rosettastone,4,13,"would be useful if there was a tool box on the side to click on, which would tell us what a particular word means, if we are ensure."
rosettastone,4,13,"overall, the pp is very useful for beginners."
rosettastone,4,13,i would recommend you download it.
rosettastone,4,0,the pp uses visual auditory and writing all together to help great associations.
rosettastone,4,0,i enjoy learning phrases instead of just individual words at a time.
rosettastone,4,1,this pp is great!
rosettastone,4,1,the only issue is that i need to record what i learn by cooling terms so i know the true definitions.
rosettastone,4,0,it seems like a good pp so far.
rosettastone,4,0,i'd say getting a brand new phone or using a good microphone would indefinitely help.
rosettastone,4,0,i just wish learning these different languages didn have to cost anything...i mean that's what everyone lacks is communication skill regardless of region.
rosettastone,4,0,but it's not my call ll
rosettastone,4,0,going through core does not show romance or ilyin when learning how to pronounce words.
rosettastone,4,0,makes me wonder if i have the right pronunciation or if i am just muddying the words.
rosettastone,4,1,the pp os great for learning languages if your going on a trip or just want to learn.
rosettastone,4,1,i dont like that to have to pay for all the features and they could add more features to the free version but its still very good for learning new languages.
rosettastone,4,0,it goes kind of fast and doesn't really say what kind of sound you're trying to make: b vs. v for example.
rosettastone,4,1,wish you could allow the sides to stay a dew seconds longer so we remember what we just did.
rosettastone,4,1,"very helpful, though."
rosettastone,4,1,i love this pp.
rosettastone,4,1,still getting used to it though.
rosettastone,4,1,if they could put buzz lingo on it i would never do anything else.
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes the speech recognition does not work accurately.
rosettastone,4,0,please try to improve on that.
rosettastone,4,0,good pp!
rosettastone,4,0,"great experience, just sometimes can pick up my voice well"
rosettastone,4,1,the pp is pretty easy to use and it is a great pp to use along side domingo.
rosettastone,4,1,this pp listens to your pronunciation and helps you improve them and uses relevant pictures while domingo uses longer sentences and reaches basic sentence structure.
rosettastone,4,0,it seems like the pp has trouble understanding me even when i pronounce the words correctly which results in a lower score.
rosettastone,4,0,"otherwise, this pp is great!"
rosettastone,4,5,"i enjoy the pp, it's immersion and exciting to use."
rosettastone,4,5,"however, the cost is pretty high, there would be many more regular regular subscribers if there were a more reasonable price for us."
rosettastone,4,1,learning has never been easier.
rosettastone,4,1,the pictures and repetition mean i really absorb the content.
rosettastone,4,1,"i only wish that it would explain the grammar more, as in why the grammar is different i certain situations."
rosettastone,4,1,very good.
rosettastone,4,1,could be better on pronunciation screens.
rosettastone,4,1,a little frustration when you know you're saying it properly and it's not recognizing it.
rosettastone,4,1,so far this pp is very helpful with learning a new language.
rosettastone,4,1,it's not easy learning japanese but so far i'm having fun doing it.
rosettastone,4,1,it's a bit frustration when it doesn't recognize the word i'm trying to say though.
rosettastone,4,1,"so far so good, you can clearly understand."
rosettastone,4,1,i do like that you're taken to a pronunciation phase so you learn the word and learn how to pronounce it after remembering it as it's linked to a pick of what it is or action of it 🙂 can't fault the learning side of it (5 star plus) but the price for the rest of the lessons is steep.
rosettastone,4,1,"i mean, it's worth it but it's just prices for me hence 4 star rating."
rosettastone,4,1,"monthly payment option softens the blow (1 payment each month), please consider that."
rosettastone,4,0,they still haven't gone through the alphabet... which makes no sense to me... but otherwise i'm flying through
rosettastone,4,0,i love it this far.
rosettastone,4,0,easy to you great images and very easy to use and link to my mobile device.
rosettastone,4,0,i can practice on the commune home!
rosettastone,4,0,the immense learning technique gave me n opportunity to under stand english.
rosettastone,4,0,intuition interface and sound teaching practices but some of the art could be better
rosettastone,4,0,it's your average roseola stone experience.
rosettastone,4,0,i'm currently doing german and have no issues.
rosettastone,4,0,"it just runs a little clung on sonya devices (peri, tablets, etc)"
rosettastone,4,1,"i've only done the free trial, but it was very helpful."
rosettastone,4,1,i am already able to catch bits and pieces of conversations when i hear them.
rosettastone,4,0,"good started, but still needs the human touch to answer questions like when to use est, est, and est."
rosettastone,4,0,good pp for learning but it costs a lot .
rosettastone,4,0,not a really great experience if you don't pay .
rosettastone,4,0,"sometimes really podgy about picking up voice (like, just refuses to hear you, regardless of what you're saying) but other than that it's a great pp"
rosettastone,4,1,"absolutely rioting and excellent to learn a handful of basic words and common phrases, i believe.... not certain if you can actually learn conversational language skill"
rosettastone,4,3,"i think it needs to add the alphabet, i believe if you guns do so it be easier to learn any language that's how i learn english, learn the alphabet first the everything else."
rosettastone,4,0,because it's not all free but zero defects
rosettastone,4,0,a four only in that it is immersion and having a tough time connecting the dots.
rosettastone,4,0,some hints on purity and fiction in early stages might help in particular with non-neuro based language.
rosettastone,4,4,"easy to learn, good for beginners but would be good if you didn't need to repeat activities if you got them all correct in the core activities!"
rosettastone,4,18,it is amazing pp to learn arabic language using images.
rosettastone,4,18,but additional if there could be translation of arabic into english as well then it would be easy to understand the meaning and memories the words.
rosettastone,4,0,i love the experience and the ability to learn from this pp the only thing i wish was different is for there to be a way to earn more lessons or even just the ability to get the lessons cheaper.
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes the mid just refuses to pick up any sound.
rosettastone,4,0,"other than that, a great language tool!"
rosettastone,4,0,i love the pp the only thing wrong is it doesn't really teach the basic first.
rosettastone,4,0,"very descriptive, explains thoroughly."
rosettastone,4,0,"and very repetition.. i personally learn better with this pp, then previous pp i have started to learn with"
rosettastone,4,0,it's very good to learn vocabulary.
rosettastone,4,0,they need to breakdown the understanding of verbs to make it easier to understand spanish verb conjunction.
rosettastone,4,0,"overall, definitely helps but needs to be practiced everyday."
rosettastone,4,0,"if i had no previous hebrew studies, this pp would not be very helpful."
rosettastone,4,0,my knowledge of hebrew vocabulary is the only reason i have any idea what i'm saying or hearing.
rosettastone,4,0,"this is a great pp for learning phrases in different languages, if you are a had patient."
rosettastone,4,0,the translation part doesn't always work but it's still an awesome pp.
rosettastone,4,0,you dont necessarily need it
rosettastone,4,0,good but often doesn't hear me speak with the phone just inches away.
rosettastone,4,0,other than that it has been a great learning tool
rosettastone,4,0,it's not perfect but it's really great.
rosettastone,4,0,a little trouble with the voice recognition sometimes but not enough to cause any real difficulty
rosettastone,4,1,i love it it reaches the new language the same way your learned your native language buy i wish i could get complete access for free
rosettastone,4,1,it's fun and easy to learn.
rosettastone,4,1,only drawback is that it goes to fast.
rosettastone,4,0,it has been great in my understanding of the french language.
rosettastone,4,0,i recommend it!
rosettastone,4,0,very good language learning pp
rosettastone,4,0,it is good for my daughter but it gave her words and sentences in spanish but didn't translate to what it was in english to know what she was learning or saying
rosettastone,4,0,the pp helps me with japanese but the mid dont pick up my japanese.
rosettastone,4,0,ply work on the mid.
rosettastone,4,0,the
rosettastone,4,0,the pp is easy to use and learning style is great!
rosettastone,4,0,!
rosettastone,4,0,my only consolation is that on mobile the text is often very small.
rosettastone,4,0,nice pp and very user friendly.
rosettastone,4,0,the voice recognition needs improvement though.
rosettastone,4,0,it is very good but all of it needs to be free.
rosettastone,4,0,communication should be free!
rosettastone,4,0,so far so good.
rosettastone,4,0,only problem is that it cannot seem to hear me which leads to much frustration.
rosettastone,4,0,"so far on the free version it's not bad, learn the basis."
rosettastone,4,0,thinking about doing the purchased version.
rosettastone,4,0,it's an interesting pp to learn languages.
rosettastone,4,0,good pp.
rosettastone,4,0,easy to use.
rosettastone,4,0,4 because i can't listen to music at the same time but a good pp.
rosettastone,4,0,my phone doesn't capture my pronunciation very well but the lesson was clear and easy to follow.
rosettastone,4,0,i hope to be able to at least hold a basic conversation after i finish the lesson plan.
rosettastone,4,0,good for learning basis of a language.
rosettastone,4,0,speech recognition on a phone could be better though
rosettastone,4,0,i'm learning to be a translator and it is very good but only four stars because there is always room for improvement
rosettastone,4,0,"great for language learning as long as you compliment it with more practical knowledge, don't be lazy about this stuff though."
rosettastone,4,0,"i really enjoy this pp, and these lessons would be worth buying, but i give it a 4 star because i'm a broke rat, and i decide to be salt."
rosettastone,4,0,i don't like the way it doesn't translate to english immediately to know what i'm reading because i'm just a beginner
rosettastone,4,0,very good but not free
rosettastone,4,0,i would say this language software is a great supplement to learning a new language.
rosettastone,4,0,the easy they it it makes it look easy to learn the language.
rosettastone,4,0,it said i learned 16 new words from just the first lesson but i only know what about 5 of them mean
rosettastone,4,1,amazing dismounted life time pass happy with the pp
rosettastone,4,0,"overall quite good, just speech recognition is sometimes not recognizing and then annoying"
rosettastone,4,0,good opportunity to learn and practice languages.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish we didn't get penalized for answering questions on images that are based on one's interpretation
rosettastone,4,0,good pronunciation drills.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish there was some english direction though
rosettastone,4,1,it is a very useful pp for learning languages.
rosettastone,4,1,but there's still room for improvement.😁
rosettastone,4,0,easy patterns and simple instructions.
rosettastone,4,0,all you need is persistence and the willing to learn.
rosettastone,4,1,"i like this pp, but it would be useful to have the ilyin as well as the chinese characters."
rosettastone,4,0,this pp is great for learning if you already know a little i would recommend using other apes or sites before hand to learn the alphabet of a language first
rosettastone,4,0,"pretty good, wish i could get to the level in already at and go from there but the beginning stages are a good refreshed"
rosettastone,4,0,"the pp does work well, yet it sometimes says you pronounced a word wrong even if you said it the same way it said it"
rosettastone,4,0,i like the pp.
rosettastone,4,0,it helps me with my homework and other languages i always wanted to dear
rosettastone,4,1,i love this so much!
rosettastone,4,1,it is very helpful.
rosettastone,4,1,"i would like if you were able to say what words are like i am learning spanish, so el."
rosettastone,4,1,i would be very helpful.
rosettastone,4,0,easy to follow along.
rosettastone,4,0,provides a good learning platform.
rosettastone,4,0,it is the best thing ever!
rosettastone,4,0,!its just a bit hard... anyway i'm learning japanese and it's fun!
rosettastone,4,0,certain images are too small when using on a phone - have to resort to guessing
rosettastone,4,0,its actually really good only bad thing is all the offers it has and tells you to get otherwise its totally free🌊🌹
rosettastone,4,0,good basic lessons for free
rosettastone,4,0,i have tried several german language apes like this but so far this is the best.
rosettastone,4,0,very good and useful pp for learning as a beginner
rosettastone,4,0,really good but some words need to be explained prior to lesson
rosettastone,4,0,i love this pp learning different languages is fun and educational especially when your traveling
rosettastone,4,0,it's doing amazing for me.
rosettastone,4,0,just wish we didn't have to pay.
rosettastone,4,0,well designed lessons and easy to use
rosettastone,4,0,love it it really sticks however bit price
rosettastone,4,0,it's really good (^^)!
rosettastone,4,0,but i wish you let your users try until they get it correct.
rosettastone,4,0,wish it was free.
rosettastone,4,0,really enjoying it
rosettastone,4,0,it's great but i wish the lessons to buy were less expensive
rosettastone,4,0,very cool and useful.
rosettastone,4,0,should be free.
rosettastone,4,0,"great tool, but does not immediately teach you the basic travel survival words."
rosettastone,4,0,there is no translation in non paid pack
rosettastone,4,0,very cool but have to pay..
rosettastone,4,0,good pp and walks you through easily and logical
rosettastone,4,0,great but need english translation...!
rosettastone,4,0,good program but seems expensive for an pp.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish it was like domingo (can be used without money)
rosettastone,4,0,interactive and information .
rosettastone,4,0,nice pp to learn any language.
rosettastone,4,0,best practice.
rosettastone,4,0,very straightforward and practical
rosettastone,4,0,great application and product so far!
rosettastone,4,0,great program.
rosettastone,4,0,love learning with pictures.
rosettastone,4,0,pretty good.
rosettastone,4,0,the 30 min lesson took less than 30 minutes.
rosettastone,4,0,wish i could repeat it over and over to ensure retention.
rosettastone,4,0,"just doing the free trial right now, but i am enjoying it so far!"
rosettastone,4,0,its the only way to learn a different language.
rosettastone,4,0,easy to understand.
rosettastone,4,0,a bit prices.
rosettastone,4,0,pronouncing difficult very limited could give more time to pronounce words
rosettastone,4,0,very good but its a bit annoying u have to pay
rosettastone,4,0,it only allows you to access some of the online learning nodules using the phone pp.
rosettastone,4,0,i am not able to find the option to change from beginner to intermediate on my pp.
rosettastone,4,0,please help
rosettastone,4,0,good job with having you repeat words so you retain it with images.
rosettastone,4,0,very easy to use and follow.
rosettastone,4,0,picture association is really great for my memory!
rosettastone,4,14,this has been a great pp.
rosettastone,4,14,"however, it is so repetition, and each lesson can get boring after a while."
rosettastone,4,14,"i feel like as if you have the lesson settings switched to ""normal"" mode, you might miss practicing some key grammar or pronunciation skill, however if you have it set to the ""extended"" setting it becomes way too repetition and easy after a while."
rosettastone,4,14,i've got my fingers crossed the developer can one day make a more challenging mode.
rosettastone,4,14,my hope is up.
rosettastone,4,0,i have had two different experiences learning new languages with a program online.
rosettastone,4,0,these experiences were domingo & roseola.
rosettastone,4,0,"roseola is a lot better at actually building the foundation of language in my experience, due to its emphasis on pictures rather than to the user's native lounge."
rosettastone,4,0,"however, it's not perfect."
rosettastone,4,0,"the desktop version until recently was programme in the flash standard, which is being retired next year."
rosettastone,4,0,"also, it is $100+ per year."
rosettastone,4,0,"#1 is fixed, and the software is worth every penny"
rosettastone,4,0,sublime and very practical
rosettastone,4,0,so far so good.
rosettastone,4,0,"way better than domingo, and i cannot compare to babel because they dont offer arabic."
rosettastone,4,0,so far i have been kept interested in the lessons (only finished 1).
rosettastone,4,0,it's a little difficult to move through vocabulary so fast during the core lesson and you are expected to remember it.
rosettastone,4,0,"happy for the pronunciation and grammar lessons, although the program doesn't always understand what i am saying."
rosettastone,4,0,"i guess i either need better enunciation or a better mid, but i will update rating accordingly."
rosettastone,4,3,i love the ability to learn more languages.
rosettastone,4,3,"but, my biggest issue with your program is at times i know what pictures to match up but, not a clue what it actually means."
rosettastone,4,3,also most of the lessons so far are you talking and my grammar is not on point according to the germans i work with.
rosettastone,4,3,would be nice to have to say everything instead of just you talking 90% of the time.
rosettastone,4,3,i've learnt you learn faster by doing instead of listening alone.
rosettastone,4,3,thank you for your time have a great day.
rosettastone,4,3,so dropping 1 star.
rosettastone,4,0,great way to learn on the go.
rosettastone,4,0,can use it office.
rosettastone,4,0,"listening, speaking and reading complements each other."
rosettastone,4,0,"if you want to learn writing, this pp doesn't help much."
rosettastone,4,0,"who as long as you can read, speak,listen it is enough to find way around china."
rosettastone,4,0,works smoothly.
rosettastone,4,0,real world feel to what i am learning
rosettastone,4,0,great!!!
rosettastone,4,0,easy to follow!
rosettastone,4,0,so far i'm really loving my experience so far as lesson 4 spanish.
rosettastone,4,0,the mobile pp is a little confusing to navigable to get to your next lesson.
rosettastone,4,0,there is more than one to navigable to the lessons i choose.
rosettastone,4,0,the th star will come once i can test out my language skill to hold conversations with others.
rosettastone,4,0,"the pp is good but i would like to see the ""play"" button get an increase in size."
rosettastone,4,0,its easy to mist and get the question wrong when you just want to listen to all of the answers
rosettastone,4,0,i'm not exactly sure what i'm saying but other than that this pp is great and you should definitely check it out.
rosettastone,4,0,it could be fun if only i had the attention span to keep up with it
rosettastone,4,4,"i'm learning a lot fast & enjoy the mix of vocabulary, pronunciation, etc."
rosettastone,4,4,"only downside i have so far, i have the sensitivity fairly low on pronunciation & often it says it can't hear me, background too loud, or volume too high."
rosettastone,4,4,"a little frustration, however, i'm absolutely sure, it doesn't hurt to practice my pronunciation over & over, ll!"
rosettastone,4,4,"also, occasionally a little tricky to follow what or how i'm supposed to be answer."
rosettastone,4,4,"i've only been on a week, so i'm sure i'll understand better soon!"
rosettastone,4,0,it's decent.
rosettastone,4,0,"for one language, you can subscribe or buy lifetime use."
rosettastone,4,0,"for the length of time it takes to complete one language, i recommend paying for 1 year increments ($100) or the lifetime subscription ($200)."
rosettastone,4,0,the voice recognition system is the only thing that i don't like.
rosettastone,4,0,"sometimes, i have to scream it."
rosettastone,4,0,"other times, i have to almost whisper."
rosettastone,4,0,"and half of the time, i can speak normally."
rosettastone,4,0,i do not have this problem with domingo.
rosettastone,4,0,"i know that it's not my pronunciation because i'll say it the exact same way, but at varying volume levels and get practically different results."
rosettastone,4,0,this happens when i'm alone in a room with no background noise whatsoever.
rosettastone,4,0,it's very frustration and the only reason why i don't rate the pp 5 stars.
rosettastone,4,0,i would also recommend using this in addition to another language learning program or method.
rosettastone,4,0,it's not that you do not get a decent education so much as i find that myself and others learn best when exposed to a variety of methods in tender.
rosettastone,4,0,"do this and maybe also domingo, or audit cos (free to rent from your local library), moves, to shows, exposure to native speakers, etc."
rosettastone,4,0,you'll never really learn or implement what you learn from just one method.
rosettastone,4,3,very easy to use.
rosettastone,4,3,the pictures really help to associate words with meaning and the voice shows you how to pronounce the words correctly.
rosettastone,4,3,"you jump right into conversation without learning the basic words and structure of the language first, which is how immersion learning works i guess, but i feel like it helps that i have had some spanish classes in the past."
rosettastone,4,3,i think this is a perfect tool to help you learn to actually converse in spanish!
rosettastone,4,0,a great pp for learning a new language intuitively.
rosettastone,4,0,it uses pictures to build associations between your new language and the word's meaning.
rosettastone,4,0,the audit analysis is great at telling you when you've not pronounced a word correctly however it's not great at helping you improve.
rosettastone,4,0,simply asking you to try again.
rosettastone,4,0,that said it is a brilliant pp and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn a new language.
rosettastone,4,1,"certainly a great way to learn spanish, listening, reading, and writing."
rosettastone,4,1,the only fault i have found is sometimes they speak too fast and it would be nice to slow it down to hear the pronunciation better.
rosettastone,4,1,"i know they want to totally immense you in the language, but if i can't understand each word/sound, then all i am getting is frustrated, not educated."
rosettastone,4,1,"overall though, definitely worth the time and money."
rosettastone,4,5,"great pp, bit expensive and it is limited in that once you've done the 20 units that's it, nothing more."
rosettastone,4,5,i used it and went to a french conversational class.
rosettastone,4,5,i think you need both as grammar isn't really explained.
rosettastone,4,5,tried to sign up on their webster but due to some pitch could subscribe.
rosettastone,4,5,contracted customer service but what seemed to me an automatic reply.
rosettastone,4,5,overall pp is good but expensive and limited.
rosettastone,4,12,"i love that you are held to a standard of ninety percent to pass it, because you learn and retain a lot more information."
rosettastone,4,12,"what i don't like about it though, is that it does not have very much french for you to learn without the full version."
rosettastone,4,12,for the full version you have to pay quite a bit of money.
rosettastone,4,12,i use it as an pp for some more french a long with two other french apes i have.
rosettastone,4,12,"(domingo, and rabble) it is great for learning french, but only if you pay for the full version."
rosettastone,4,12,"otherwise, your stuck with learning what eating, running, and reading are in french."
rosettastone,4,12,i recommend domingo.
rosettastone,4,3,i am an audit learner.so this helps me remember things.
rosettastone,4,3,i like that it repeats and shows pictures.
rosettastone,4,3,what i don't like it there is no definition section to look up a word.
rosettastone,4,3,so i have to look to goose which gives me the literal definition so not always helpful.
rosettastone,4,3,i also don't like that i can sit.
rosettastone,4,3,at my computer and use the same account.
rosettastone,4,3,it has to be all on my phone which makes it hard for me to stay focused.
rosettastone,4,3,i wish roseola stone would let you use the account with another device.
rosettastone,4,0,clashes itself or boots my whole goose fixed 2 every time i try to create an account or log in.
rosettastone,4,0,"seems to work on older versions of andros, but that doesn't help me much."
rosettastone,4,0,a shame.
rosettastone,4,0,***** update: the bug was from my phone trying to launch in portrait mode rather than landscape.
rosettastone,4,0,it now seems to be working since i've sussex that out and forced it into landscape mode on launch.
rosettastone,4,0,good customer service when i pulled up the chat and started trouble shooting.
rosettastone,4,0,cupping my rating for now from 1* to 4*.
rosettastone,4,5,i love the way this is teaching so far.
rosettastone,4,5,"when trying to press the play button on mobile it is super easy to accidentally select the bubble as your answer instead of pressing the ""play"" button."
rosettastone,4,5,i even tried using a status and still occasionally selected the wrong answer when i was just trying to hear the option spoken out loud.
rosettastone,4,5,"while i do love the zero english, i do think some direct translations would help on occasion."
rosettastone,4,0,i am learning fairly fast with this pp.
rosettastone,4,0,i enjoy being able to pause and continue the lessons as needed.
rosettastone,4,0,"the only issue i ever have is minor, when it comes to speaking the language, sometimes it does not clearly determine what i said."
rosettastone,4,0,"this may be a combination of the pp, my phone, and the setting i am using it in."
rosettastone,4,8,this is a good pp and program for learning pronunciation and how to think in a new language.
rosettastone,4,8,"even though there are no direct translations, it's easy to pick up on what's going on by looking at the pictures and noticing patterns."
rosettastone,4,8,i have occasionally used goose translate to figure out the finer grammatical details.
rosettastone,4,8,"i use this pp alongside domingo, which is more text based, and i think it has helped my pronunciation and tremendous."
rosettastone,4,8,i bought 1 year on sale for $90 during black friday.
rosettastone,4,0,great pp.
rosettastone,4,0,got it today and i already feel like i'm learning.
rosettastone,4,0,"i give it 4 stars because every single lesson you finish, it asks if you want to rate the pp."
rosettastone,4,0,"i can tell you from experience it will only allow you to leave one rating, but once you've left a rating it will never stop asking if you like to leave another."
rosettastone,4,0,might as well never rate at all if you can make the message go away either way.
rosettastone,4,0,it's a good learning pp!
rosettastone,4,0,for all languages.
rosettastone,4,0,"although, i'd like it if there was english before, so it can tell us what that word or sentence is then go away at a later time."
rosettastone,4,0,or at least a button for people who wanted it.
rosettastone,4,0,its a really good pp though.
rosettastone,4,0,and you can change your language daytime you want and it'll save your progress on the other language.
rosettastone,4,4,"early days so no conversational stuff yet, but a really good foundation."
rosettastone,4,4,"a bit on the expensive side, but if you can get a half price deal i'd say it's worth it."
rosettastone,4,4,"i recommend learning in conjunction with an audit program to get additional speaking practise in (with makarin, it's all about the intonation)."
rosettastone,4,4,one criticism is that the reading lessons in unit one are so ridiculously easy they feel like a waste of time
rosettastone,4,1,"excellent learning tool, however i'm not sure if its good for all earners."
rosettastone,4,1,not having a translation into english really challenges the brain to think of what is meant in the pictures and that can be misleading at times.
rosettastone,4,1,"it makes the lesson a bit more difficult to understand but when you get it, it stays with you"
rosettastone,4,1,"it is amazing but falling short of the rest of the features no games (games in the web version could be expanded to more than a handful) no public chat no multiplayer/person some of the display isn't inconvenient, appearing tiny, when you have an image to match words."
rosettastone,4,1,roseola stone is an amazing pp but you need to use it on the computer to obtain the full experience.
rosettastone,4,1,i strongly recommend the pp as a start but i do not agree for a full price for someone who will only use the pp.
rosettastone,4,2,good but speech recognition could use some fine tuning to work well with car bluetooth device.
rosettastone,4,2,it can barely hear me speaking so it marks the answer wrong.
rosettastone,4,2,"speech recognition is the best thing to practice in the car since it allows for hands free training and i can keep my eyes on the road, just listen and speak...well if it worked well it would be the best training."
rosettastone,4,5,i'm learning so much so fast.
rosettastone,4,5,my only problem is that the pronunciation portions are a little itchy.
rosettastone,4,5,i will be in a silent room and it will tell me that audit is too loud?
rosettastone,4,5,so i have to keep taking parts i know i'm passing.
rosettastone,4,5,also feel like the basis should be more about letters and bowels than actual questions in the other language.
rosettastone,4,5,i have no idea what i'm saying even with the pictures sometimes.
rosettastone,4,5,but overall great success thank you!
rosettastone,4,0,"i really am enjoying the pp,, the only problem i have is that the pictures are too small when they're comparing places if you need glasses and they introduce words without telling you what they mean but other than that the pp is it wonderful."
rosettastone,4,0,i'm in mexico right now and i would recommend the pp to anybody because i am learning words and being able to speak to people in mexico.
rosettastone,4,0,i also had a problem that customer service was able to fix promptly and courteously .
rosettastone,4,2,it's surprisingly easy to use and very effective.
rosettastone,4,2,i find it more admitting and fun than most of the other games on my phone.
rosettastone,4,2,it is certainly worth the investment.
rosettastone,4,2,"it can be frustration because it is completely immersion and without translations it is sometimes difficult to know exactly what i'm learning, but it makes it better in the long run."
rosettastone,4,36,"so far, so good."
rosettastone,4,36,"i made an account for the japanese unit and my only issues is sometimes, the voice lessons don't work and you have to start the pp."
rosettastone,4,36,the other issue is that you can only do unit 1 without paying money.
rosettastone,4,36,"even with those issues, roseola stone works well for me, even with its 'throw em in the water and hope they swim' strategy."
rosettastone,4,36,it actually works and helps me learn the verbs and grammar of the target language without explanation.
rosettastone,4,36,"i must say, thanks, roseola stone!"
rosettastone,4,0,the format is great and i feel like i'm learning a lot!
rosettastone,4,0,the pp does have some bags though that required me to install and reinstate but that seems to have fixed them.
rosettastone,4,10,roseola stone uses a very effective method to turn learning a language into an intellectual game.
rosettastone,4,10,"the only thing i dont like is that sometimes it's not always 100% clear what something means as it doesn give u a direct translation, but rather pictures."
rosettastone,4,10,"however, having said that with roseola stone, most of the time, i can learn a language in as little as a month when studying intensely, which is way faster than other methods i have tried :)"
rosettastone,4,8,"i do like this, my only need is to have the ability to see what you learned in each section so you can review it without needing to go over already completed work."
rosettastone,4,8,so i can write down what is learned.
rosettastone,4,8,"like chapter reviews of the things you learned in a list, sentences and vocal."
rosettastone,4,8,"also i think the jayshree needs to changed to allow pelt to choose if they want to learn with full anti, or just kann (hiragana/katakana) only and romance."
rosettastone,4,8,the full anti didn't bother me as i'm not a beginner.
rosettastone,4,8,so if you're a beginner listen to what's being said and use the photo to understand what is being said.
rosettastone,4,8,you should never use english when studying any language.
rosettastone,4,8,learning by context helps most.
rosettastone,4,0,"so far, in really enjoying the pp, and find it very helpful!"
rosettastone,4,0,"i like how it reaches without translation, and the pp itself is easy to use."
rosettastone,4,0,"however, i find that some of the translations (in organ) don't match the picture?"
rosettastone,4,0,"like, it can say ""여자가 of 막어여"" which means, the woman is eating r i c e, but the picture shows a woman eating spaghetti?"
rosettastone,4,0,"i might be understanding it wrong, but in pretty sure i'm right."
rosettastone,4,0,"if some one can help, i'll be very thankful!"
rosettastone,4,0,:)
rosettastone,4,0,"this is the awesome pp, but it's too slow...i mean when i do excesses all the same repeats again and again, i need more diversity during 1 unit."
rosettastone,4,0,and the speaker repeat a phrase before and after i inserted a word.
rosettastone,4,0,i don't have so must patience to complete it.
rosettastone,4,0,"but i really love this pp, and i just want you to speed it up."
rosettastone,4,0,thank you.
rosettastone,4,10,it's pretty good!!
rosettastone,4,10,"i got it to learn more english well and work on my pronunciation, so far i think it is working, the only down side is that you can't log onto another device until you log out in your other device."
rosettastone,4,10,i use this pp with my lawton the most and there has been instances where i forgets to log out and can't use the pp during my lunch at work on my phone or tablet.
rosettastone,4,10,i don't like that it can't be opened on multiple devices.
rosettastone,4,15,"the mobile version of roseola stone is great, but has some flaws."
rosettastone,4,15,most certain to speaking.
rosettastone,4,15,"unless you have a professional level microphone, it will tell you that you failed the first time, but upon saying the word or phrase a second time, it will say you got it 100% correct."
rosettastone,4,15,"mild annoyance, but overall worth your time and money."
rosettastone,4,1,user friendly and i am learning.
rosettastone,4,1,"i do wish there was more help with pronunciation, like if i get a word wrong repetitively, i'd like to be given the option for extra physics help."
rosettastone,4,1,"i use domingo along with this, because being able to write(type) out words helps me learn them and that is one thing this pp is missing."
rosettastone,4,1,"also would be nice to have a ""general grammar rule"" section to reference for help."
rosettastone,4,76,it's a fun and pretty easy program.
rosettastone,4,76,"the only problem i have with it so far is, in the early portions of the program, it doesn't directly tell you what any of the words mean."
rosettastone,4,76,this creates a bit of a barrier you ha 've to surround on your own every time you hit a block.
rosettastone,4,76,"but, once you've overcome that hardly, it's smooth sailing for quite a while!"
rosettastone,4,1,"i like it a lot and it is really helpful to visualized and pronounce these words, but without telling you the definitions it can be difficult."
rosettastone,4,1,you never know if you are perceiving it wrong and therefore learning the language wrong.
rosettastone,4,1,"especially in the beginning, you don't want to mess up the basis."
rosettastone,4,1,"if using this pp, learn the words first on another pp but then use this one to practice those basis."
rosettastone,4,1,"even though it wouldn't be the first pp i would use, it is still really great practice!"
rosettastone,4,0,a brief and clarifying explanation will be helpful in addition to just showing pictures to make us have a firm grasp of the grammar lessons.
rosettastone,4,0,i personally find learning grammar by scanning pictures a bit hard.
rosettastone,4,0,i mean using pictures to teach vocabulary is great but i think learning grammar will be much clearer and less ambiguous if learned directly and then aided with visual rather than having them figured out solely from pictures.
rosettastone,4,0,"away, i like this pp."
rosettastone,4,0,probably one of the best ones out there.
rosettastone,4,0,only had it a few days but great so far
rosettastone,4,1,excellent pp and product overall.
rosettastone,4,1,"my biggest and only issue like others have mentioned, it will pick and choose when it wants to hear me."
rosettastone,4,1,"i use a bone heads in a silent room, it'll say i'm mispronouncing/can't hear me say easy words, or as someone else mentioned during the pronunciation exercises it acts up (like it has trouble recognizing the word parts when it tries to break them down), but doesn't have trouble picking up the complex stuff."
rosettastone,4,0,super sick.
rosettastone,4,0,you can pause.
rosettastone,4,0,you can keep trying until you get 100%.
rosettastone,4,0,"sometimes it refuses to accept your pronunciation as accurate even when it's for something as simple as ""ah."""
rosettastone,4,0,it also sometimes takes awhile to register your pronunciation so you are left waiting to see if you were correct.
rosettastone,4,5,"many people already know roseola stone is the premier way to learn a new language; however, their method of immersing the learner in the language may frustrate some."
rosettastone,4,5,the use of external vocabulary resources may be necessary for some earners since roseola stone is graphically based rather than translation based.
rosettastone,4,5,i wish the way the pp presented lessons was a little more streamlined.
rosettastone,4,5,"you start with a daily lesson plan, but once that is finished, you no longer have a prescribed daily goal."
rosettastone,4,5,i really like the pp.
rosettastone,4,5,easy and fun to use.
rosettastone,4,5,"the licensing is more expensive than others, but i think it is worth it."
rosettastone,4,5,"be careful to not sign up for the deceptive ""3 month trial"" it is only 3 days in the fine print and you will get charged sooner than you think!"
rosettastone,4,5,if it were not for that deception i would give this 5 stars.
rosettastone,4,0,it takes a good time repeating the lesson
rosettastone,4,0,"i think this pp would be hard to use as your only way to learn a language, but it's great functionality-wise."
rosettastone,4,0,very stable.
rosettastone,4,0,i'm using it for organ.
rosettastone,4,0,i spent 9 months in more and feel the pronunciation check is quite good.
rosettastone,4,0,fabulous language learning tool that's much more immersion than most but probably needs supplementing with other sources.
rosettastone,4,4,i love this pp but i wish that there was more organization with tense that go along with each verb.
rosettastone,4,4,grouped lists at the beginning of each lesson on what is to come would be helpful so i could write them down and study them extra.
rosettastone,4,4,many verbs have different endings than others but i am slowly catching on.
rosettastone,4,4,makes it easier to have a client italian speaking parent to explain why some have different than others and what they are.
rosettastone,4,4,hoping for lessons that not only have you say and match pictures.
rosettastone,4,4,also this pp has a hard time hearing me.
rosettastone,4,4,i dont have a big bulky case on my phone anymore for this reason.
rosettastone,4,4,thinking it has something to do with internet service.
rosettastone,4,209,i like roseola stone's approach.
rosettastone,4,209,"the zero translation and repetition until it sticks seems to work best for me even if it can feel a little tedious at the time, it's still fun to use."
rosettastone,4,209,it also includes more speaking than other apes i've used as well as listening exercises where you can't read what's being said which is good practice for conversations.
rosettastone,4,209,"a lot of reviews mark it down for no translations which is the whole point of is, would recommend trying it"
rosettastone,4,14,excellent way for me to pass day at work learning.
rosettastone,4,14,only major issue to me is the price point if they did it closer to do lingo or kept it free for veterans and active service members i would give it a perfect score.
rosettastone,4,14,that said you do get a clot for no payment and you can always do a free trial to see if it's a good fit or something that you will stick to.
rosettastone,4,0,so far so good.
rosettastone,4,0,they do a great job with the pictures that go along with the sentence... makes for a more real world learning experience.
rosettastone,4,0,i do wish there was a section where i could just learn all the root verbs and conversations using the same format and technique they use for vocal and grammar in general.
rosettastone,4,0,a fun and painless way to learn a new language.
rosettastone,4,0,planning on supplementing with some more traditional material.
rosettastone,4,0,occasionally difficult with voice recognition (seems to work better if i speak loudly).
rosettastone,4,0,doesn't seem to synchronise mobile to pp but slightly different learning material offered on each (writing only on pp).
rosettastone,4,15,perfect for advanced beginners like me.
rosettastone,4,15,be sure to know basic hiragana and katakana before starting.
rosettastone,4,15,you need to know that anyway.
rosettastone,4,15,"if you know some anti and want to learn more, you can change from only displaying phonetics to displaying furigana."
rosettastone,4,15,overall this is a highly recommended companion for your nihongo studies.
rosettastone,4,15,"i would not advise getting this if you have never studied, though."
rosettastone,4,15,reality is that japanese is difficult language to learn for most westerners.
rosettastone,4,15,this is worth the $.
rosettastone,4,4,so far i am really enjoying this learning experience.
rosettastone,4,4,"once i figured out how roseola stone applies the learning technique, i have found it to be very engaging."
rosettastone,4,4,it can be frustration at times because the voice recognition has trouble with my southern accent i think.
rosettastone,4,4,there are also instances where the program doesn't recognize that i have completed a lesson and this requires repeating it.
rosettastone,4,4,not necessarily a bad thing because a review is helpful.
rosettastone,4,4,i am looking forward to continuing this journey!
rosettastone,4,2,"i love the pp, and it's valuable for learning grammar and vocabulary; the pronunciation exercises, however, are useless, because despite doing everything support suggests, it won't register my voice properly."
rosettastone,4,2,"it also has a bug in which it gives me a full green circle for pronouncing the words/sounds correctly, but then marks me wrong."
rosettastone,4,2,frustration.
rosettastone,4,2,update: still no fix to the pronunciation exercise bags.
rosettastone,4,2,"thankful, it doesn't prevent you from progressing through the lessons by not passing them."
rosettastone,4,3,the approach to teaching with complete immersion will work if i can stick with it.
rosettastone,4,3,"absolutely no english to explain what i am saying, makes it difficult."
rosettastone,4,3,i wish they better explained what they wanted you to do with each new lesson.
rosettastone,4,3,it's repetition but i think that is the way they get you to know the words and make it second nature to you.
rosettastone,4,3,i tried domingo and it really repeated but did have a lot of english.
rosettastone,4,3,i was thinking if i did roseola with the free ones as a compliment it might work well.
rosettastone,4,0,"this is a great pp, it doesn pressed you,but the only thing that is not high quality is that you have to may for a level of learning,"
rosettastone,4,0,great way of learning.
rosettastone,4,0,(but!!)
rosettastone,4,0,"i thought it was free, (like public school) but like any other!"
rosettastone,4,0,it ask for credit like i need a student loan..
rosettastone,4,1,"full immersion is a bit of a shock to the system, especially as i am trying to learn japanese."
rosettastone,4,1,while i am picking up things it is hard to say if what i am picking up is correct as you have to try and make it up as you go.
rosettastone,4,1,"i find that i have had to combine this with other apes, although it is still really days"
rosettastone,4,0,easy to navigable through it.
rosettastone,4,10,"i really like it, just wish it had all the bells and whistles after you buy it for your phone but apparently not all lessons are compatible(teach support told me this) and i thought to myself.. self, if you just paid for that language (not free version) shouldn i be able to do all the lessons or least be able to login on pp an do it but if you go that route you have to buy it again."
rosettastone,4,10,thus demonstrates my -1 star frustration.
rosettastone,4,10,that said it is very well made and i really enjoy what i get from it.
rosettastone,4,0,i just finished my first 2 short lessons and it's great.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish if the pronunciation was less than their 100% or full circle that they would give you the option to try again.
rosettastone,4,0,other than that the program looks great.
rosettastone,4,0,plus there are many different languages to pick from!
rosettastone,4,0,i really wish there was a strictly audit segment that could be used while driving.
rosettastone,4,0,"the pp is great and for use you to use context clues to learn, but would be very dangerous to attempt while driving."
rosettastone,4,0,i was specifically told i could use while driving by roseola stone customer support.
rosettastone,4,51,"after helpful response from is support, i am happy to upgrade rating to 4 stars."
rosettastone,4,51,the pp and hebrew content give me most of what i want and are well worth the money.
rosettastone,4,51,"i am annoyed by bad word-splitting; e.g., ""ophanayim"" has the first letter (slept) alone on top line: it would have fit well on the next... or use a bigger button."
rosettastone,4,51,and i want option to display hebrew script letters.
rosettastone,4,51,more serious: lack of cultural specificity.
rosettastone,4,51,"i have lots more comments, no space to write."
rosettastone,4,51,thanks.
rosettastone,4,10,good way to learn on the go.
rosettastone,4,10,speech recognition works well.
rosettastone,4,10,no clashes or delayed response in lessons.
rosettastone,4,10,but some lessons seem not optimized for phone size as pictures seem too small or his allied with caution bubbles.
rosettastone,4,10,also seems to miss some of the desktop apes features like character selection.
rosettastone,4,10,for japanese there did not seem to be a way to tongue to only hiragana and karagina.
rosettastone,4,0,"extent pp for leaning, but you will still need a good grammar and if you want to full experience."
rosettastone,4,0,speaking practice is excellent for building confidence and the speech recognition difficulty can be raised to keep interesting and productive.
rosettastone,4,0,could do with an additional vocabulary builder.
rosettastone,4,0,"overall, if you're self tutoring in a language, i would definitely recommend you make it part of your plan."
rosettastone,4,2,expensive but for me the best self learning language method.
rosettastone,4,2,i only wish the pp could work in portrait mode.
rosettastone,4,2,there is no reason to force it into landscape.
rosettastone,4,2,"update: the selection interface is now portrait, one more effort to bring the lessons in portrait mode too!"
rosettastone,4,45,the pp is quite effective and helpful plans lessons and review.
rosettastone,4,45,the one thing i would like is if they would have an english translation and not just show you the foreign language by itself.
rosettastone,4,45,that would help me with the grammar.
rosettastone,4,45,"also, you're not able to do the writing lessons on your phone."
rosettastone,4,45,"over all though, it is very helpful and keeps me on track."
rosettastone,4,6,pretty good but i think it starts at a weird place ??
rosettastone,4,6,maybe it's made for people who already have some knowledge on the language.
rosettastone,4,6,i wish they also translated what it all meant weather just have us guess ??
rosettastone,4,6,i'd like to know exactly what i'm saying you know ?
rosettastone,4,6,other than that i really like it.
rosettastone,4,1,it's a very useful and well put together pp and program.
rosettastone,4,1,the only reason the pp is not five stars is because every once in a while it won't register my voice.
rosettastone,4,1,so i either fail or have to say a phrase or word multiple times for it to register.
rosettastone,4,22,works well.
rosettastone,4,22,often there are issues with the pictures and the subject that properly needs to be addressed when firing out what exactly needs to be said or chosen.
rosettastone,4,22,for example there a mon and a boy pointing at a woman in a car.
rosettastone,4,22,if the picture is small its very unclear what in looking at.
rosettastone,4,22,or there so much there i can decipher what the subject matter truly is.
rosettastone,4,22,so its really confusing.
rosettastone,4,0,there is a pretty good selection of languages to choose from.
rosettastone,4,0,i'm currently trying irish.
rosettastone,4,0,way harder then i thought.
rosettastone,4,0,the pp is incredibly easy to use.
rosettastone,4,0,"but when you have to pronounce the words, i suggest you go to a very quiet room so the pp can understand you."
rosettastone,4,0,otherwise i'd recommend it.
rosettastone,4,0,the core lessons are fine but what really others me is the pronunciation feature.
rosettastone,4,0,for some languages it expects me to pronounce words as if i'm an native speaker.
rosettastone,4,0,even for easy syllables (like 'ba') the pp will still say you pronounced it incorrectly.
rosettastone,4,0,that others me.
rosettastone,4,1,in only on lesson 2. i am familiar with japanese.
rosettastone,4,1,"its seems good at introducing vocal and grammar, as well as anti."
rosettastone,4,1,"i do feel like the multiple choice makes it easy to make educated guesses, but maybe it works out in the long run."
rosettastone,4,1,i enjoy spending time on it.
rosettastone,4,1,great pp.
rosettastone,4,1,i seem to have some issues though between singing.
rosettastone,4,1,"every time i open the pp it says congratulations on finishing week, even though i'm on week 3. there's a button that takes me to my latest though so it's not too much of a bother, but still weird."
rosettastone,4,13,i originally bought a d from for home but now with smartphones and the lack of a d drive in my newer computers i felt a subscription would be more useful.
rosettastone,4,13,the content is the same but in a much easier to access format here.
rosettastone,4,13,i love being able to study at work or on the go.
rosettastone,4,88,"i like the pp, i just always dread the pronunciation lessons because it doesn't register my voice very well."
rosettastone,4,88,no issues with my phone that would cause this problem.
rosettastone,4,88,"i just don't get 100% on every pronunciation lesson which is fine, just a bit annoying hata."
rosettastone,4,88,other than that the pp is great!
rosettastone,4,0,"not complicated once engaged, and defiantly allows to learn at your own pace"
rosettastone,4,0,its awesome i just want it to be a free plan to learn languages
rosettastone,4,0,everything is really well done.
rosettastone,4,0,"the only thing which is not clear for me is when i buy all the lessons of a language, is it a subscription for just one language?"
rosettastone,4,1,great way to learn.
rosettastone,4,1,i love that you start by actually speaking and connecting what you hear and say to images.
rosettastone,4,1,my only complaint is the requirement for long term subscriptions.
rosettastone,4,1,i would prefer a single month option to start.
rosettastone,4,9,absolutely brilliant pp... was cautious about the price but my friends studying language at university use this pp so i did it.
rosettastone,4,9,my only constructive feedback would be help with when pronunciation is incorrect... sometimes it's hard to know what to change/ fix or how to shape my mouth so i end up telling at my phone hata
rosettastone,4,0,would have given a five star if you actually gave a translation.
rosettastone,4,0,"it would be useless to learn to speak, but at the same time not know the meaning."
rosettastone,4,0,"if the translation was included and taught how to be used, things would be far more easier."
rosettastone,4,0,good pp it's helpful
rosettastone,4,1,good pp to improve your listening and speaking ability.
rosettastone,4,1,but without translation sometimes it seems difficult.
rosettastone,4,1,on mobile the size of the pictures is small and sometimes it is difficult to know the context .
rosettastone,4,0,i like how its giving attempts to pronounce and showing what part your saying from the sentence.
rosettastone,4,5,marvelous interactive pp.
rosettastone,4,5,"in pronunciation exercises, it does leave a mispronounced word prayed out, but doesn't usually prompt you to re-pronounce the missed word if the rest of the phrase is correct."
rosettastone,4,5,i haven't figured out how to go back and fix the pronunciation on the missed word.
rosettastone,4,0,it's so good i feel like i'm actually learning italian and french.
rosettastone,4,0,it's is so worth the time and effort.
rosettastone,4,0,it's a nice and easy way to learn a new language without being frustrated.
rosettastone,4,0,mainly because you can reply the recording as much as you like
rosettastone,4,0,i am still new to the pp.
rosettastone,4,0,so far though it is providing a good learning experience for me.
rosettastone,4,0,especially considering i have no previous experience in makarin.
rosettastone,4,0,still early and i haven't been able to put it to use yet but i am optimistic.
rosettastone,4,0,i do wish it gave an option for traditional makarin.
rosettastone,4,6,"great pp so far i would prefer to learn the alphabet first so i can read, pronounce and remember the words."
rosettastone,4,6,"without knowing the alphabet it feel like i'm guessing most of the time, so it takes me more time to remember the words."
rosettastone,4,0,pretty good so far.
rosettastone,4,0,the speech recognition is spot though.
rosettastone,4,2,being a new user i liked the most part of this pp it has a very easy interface that a beginner can also use very smoothly and can be familiar with any new language he want to learn.this pp also lets us to learn new languages with a very easy method with a great convenience of time.
rosettastone,4,0,immersing works for me
rosettastone,4,18,"really easy to use, the extra for learning."
rosettastone,4,18,the only reason i didn't give it a 5 is that sometimes i had to ask my partner to explain things to me as she is native speaker of the language but if you want to learn a new language for holiday or business trip else é must boy.
rosettastone,4,18,"give yourself time though, i found one unit a week was a sensible target."
rosettastone,4,0,"my only issue is using the microphone on my lawton, it doesn't work most of the time."
rosettastone,4,0,"i granted the roseola stone webster access but still not working, and i end up using the pp on my phone instead."
rosettastone,4,3,i love this pp!
rosettastone,4,3,super simple to use.
rosettastone,4,3,i rate it a 4 because it has to be completely quiet in order for the microphone to only hear you.
rosettastone,4,3,"no one else can talk, no music, or background noise."
rosettastone,4,0,absolutely brilliant however trying to learn italian and i haven't got a clue as to what it is your saying because there is no english translation to match the words with.. the photo are not always obvious.
rosettastone,4,0,other than that it's far and i'm loving learning a new language
rosettastone,4,0,"so far works great at voice recognition, not really clot of english explanations, but i believe its favoring pronunciation and a degree of memory associations between calling out singular subjects and multiple."
rosettastone,4,0,so i'm enjoying this pretty cool thus far.
rosettastone,4,0,great pace and carefully put together.
rosettastone,4,0,took a star away as really miss writing or spelling exercises.
rosettastone,4,0,great pp to learn from
rosettastone,4,1,"enjoying the pp and its great that it can help with pronunciation, but it can be frustration because often it doesn seem to hear me."
rosettastone,4,1,"still think its a good pp, though."
rosettastone,4,0,great pp.
rosettastone,4,0,"use it on the bus, while waiting for friends and supports the language course i'm taking."
rosettastone,4,0,"clot of content to practice, remembered through repetition."
rosettastone,4,0,unfortunately my language course stopped the licence so in moving onto a if pp.
rosettastone,4,2,i really like roseola stone because they teach you how you pronounce the words but i just wish that they gave you an actual schedule to follow that shows what you should do everyday because i have found some other things on the pp that i didn't even know were there or when to use them.
rosettastone,4,5,"some explanation on the differences in phrases (il= he, is= they) would help & its not allowing me to access the ""free"" lessons after the and lesson."
rosettastone,4,5,"aside from that, it seems to be very effective & will have you learning a new language without even realizing it."
rosettastone,4,5,"for that, i give it an ""a""."
rosettastone,4,8,in trying to learn japanese with this pp and its kind of useful?
rosettastone,4,8,i wish it would teach all of the characters first instead if just throwing them at you from the start.
rosettastone,4,8,i dont know what a lot of them even mean.
rosettastone,4,8,especially the anti.
rosettastone,4,8,and give tried pronouncing mass and a bunch of other stuff but it keeps saying i'm wrong even though i'm pronouncing it correctly.
rosettastone,4,8,sometimes i have to scream or make my voice higher to make it work.
rosettastone,4,8,other than that this is a good pp to use.
rosettastone,4,0,find spend more time with this language pp than others.
rosettastone,4,0,"more interactive, work on conversation actually saying the words, like the speaking analyse so know saying it right."
rosettastone,4,0,just need to have short note why something right or wrong answer in grammar.
rosettastone,4,0,pat
rosettastone,4,2,i find myself more of a visual learner and i had to find a pronunciation guide to organ letters before i could actually read or say the words on the exercises.
rosettastone,4,2,"otherwise, very helpful so far."
rosettastone,4,0,"love learning with this, my only complaint at the moment is i wish i could get translations to what i was saying to go along with the pictures."
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes it is hard to tell what is meant by the picture alone.
rosettastone,4,0,other than that i'm loving it so far!
rosettastone,4,0,great pp.
rosettastone,4,0,thank u so much
rosettastone,4,0,great learning through immersion.
rosettastone,4,0,hope there will be an option for monthly subscription to all languages.
rosettastone,4,0,at the moment the subscription model is only for one language and a bit price.🙄
rosettastone,4,0,"aside from wishing the text wouldn't get so small (my eyesight isn't great), i'm enjoying it a lot."
rosettastone,4,0,"the lessons are getting harder, but the curve is a gentle one."
rosettastone,4,6,great but needs translations.
rosettastone,4,6,"then, to me, it would be worth $100 or $200."
rosettastone,4,6,the pictures alone leave room for some confusion.
rosettastone,4,6,it doesn't feel right or trustworthy enough to have to trust outside sources for further information.
rosettastone,4,0,"very easy to press the wrong choice instead of the pronunciation aid, so the i has a little further to go."
rosettastone,4,0,"but a tried and tested great system for language learning, decently porter to a mobile platform."
rosettastone,4,0,"really good method, though i think it can be a bit intimidating for absolute beginners."
rosettastone,4,0,"the voice recognition is ok, but can sometimes be infuriatingly off."
rosettastone,4,1,it is great at having people visual learn.
rosettastone,4,1,power some spanish words it doesn explain what they are and a suggestion would be to have an ex.
rosettastone,4,1,of an english word that would sound like the accent when the person gets it wrong.
rosettastone,4,1,it can be frustration.
rosettastone,4,0,overall good pp but a bit expensive if you dont get one of the discount they offer once in a while.
rosettastone,4,0,only additional thing i like to see would be some tying exercises for those who learn best via writing.
rosettastone,4,2,"some things could be improved, for instance the time after you get an answer correct is too slow mio."
rosettastone,4,2,"it forces me to be patient, give us an option to not see the slow fades / animation"
rosettastone,4,0,it's a really good pp and quick way to learn a. language.
rosettastone,4,0,"however the speaking software is a bit buggy and doesn't always ""hear"" what you're saying."
rosettastone,4,7,the learning experience is great!
rosettastone,4,7,"i love the repeated after me effect in the lessons, it helps you pronunciation."
rosettastone,4,7,i gave them fours stars because you have to pay for the other lessons and they are quite expensive.
rosettastone,4,1,it's great to learn when you can catch on.
rosettastone,4,1,however there is no help feature that i can find that allows the program to explain why something has changed.
rosettastone,4,1,currently i'm struggling to figure out why the colors change spelling with certain words
rosettastone,4,8,the program has a difficult time with speech recognition during exercises requiring me to respond verbally.
rosettastone,4,8,that is aggravating.
rosettastone,4,8,otherwise the program seems to function well for other lesson types.
rosettastone,4,8,great native speakers.
rosettastone,4,0,very good method for learning.
rosettastone,4,0,combined pronouncing with vocabulary and grammar.
rosettastone,4,0,"avoids the ""tourist"" phrases and uses every day phrases."
rosettastone,4,0,only comment: not sure what you are buying when subscribing!
rosettastone,4,0,learning japanese which i have found challenging but the pacing from roseola is really good.
rosettastone,4,0,i find that the pp is a more challenging learning experience but it's good for when i want to practice or push myself.
rosettastone,4,9,the vocabulary is great it breaks it down for you but they don't give you enough time to write the words down.
rosettastone,4,9,"nor do they explain what the pictures are showing in english, that would help coralate some of the words."
rosettastone,4,9,as of now it's just guessing.
rosettastone,4,0,i have learned very many words and phrases.
rosettastone,4,0,i am half way through.
rosettastone,4,0,"although i don't think you could ever speak client spanish with something like this, it gave me a foundation of words that get me through south american vacation."
rosettastone,4,0,you only ever see photo.
rosettastone,4,0,"i think this is an excellent way to learn, but some of the filler words conjugations and placement i don't seem to understand."
rosettastone,4,0,perhaps by the time i finish the repetition will make it stick.
rosettastone,4,0,this is an immersion learning experience.
rosettastone,4,0,"had a little trouble with some of the pictures trying to understand what they dignified, but like the full conversation examples and responses."
rosettastone,4,1,leaning french.
rosettastone,4,1,good pp.
rosettastone,4,1,i like one time payment apes.
rosettastone,4,1,"the apes comprehension is usually good but when it doesn't understand a french person saying the slide, it's frustration."
rosettastone,4,2,"the pp is good, but think it would be better for my learning if the speakers would slow down some."
rosettastone,4,2,i would also like to to have time to practice the words and phrases.this would give me time to practice and respond.
rosettastone,4,2,thanks 😊
rosettastone,4,1,its is once pp to learn a new language.
rosettastone,4,1,the only challenge being i would prefer for example in learning chinese i would prefer a translation to my language lets say english so that i could understand more than just learning from pictures.
rosettastone,4,1,thank you.
rosettastone,4,0,good program but expensive.
rosettastone,4,0,please add sign language😍
rosettastone,4,0,very easy to learn with this pp.
rosettastone,4,0,no translation technique is ideal way to learn.
rosettastone,4,0,though i download to see if they had listening tracks for playing in the car and you can't.
rosettastone,4,1,it helps you identify new words with audit and video guides.
rosettastone,4,1,would be nice if there were some guideline rules on how the structure of grammar works.
rosettastone,4,1,sometimes it can be difficult with out your native language direction
rosettastone,4,0,"the pp can be somewhat delayed sometimes and doesn't pick up the voice if there's too much background noise, other than that i love the learning."
rosettastone,4,0,the only complaint i have so far is that random it doesn hear or understand me speaking... no matter what i do.
rosettastone,4,0,other than that its been wonderful so far.
rosettastone,4,3,"great pp to learn with, sometimes you can be left a little puzzled as the pp doesn't use types english so you are left guessing what the photo is."
rosettastone,4,3,despite this the pp is really easy to learn from!
rosettastone,4,0,i've been coming back to roseola stone off and on for a while now and i enjoy it so far.
rosettastone,4,0,"sometimes the mid doesn't pick up my voice, but i don't mind the repetition when learning a language."
rosettastone,4,0,so easy and fun
rosettastone,4,0,"this application is fantastic, i love this."
rosettastone,4,0,but some time it can not recognize my void.
rosettastone,4,0,"great language learning tool, but i would like to see the list of active languages on the top level of the menu for quick and easy twitching between them."
rosettastone,4,1,great pp and learning method.
rosettastone,4,1,"some of the pronunciation has the letters on the wrong syllable, and i would give an option to study the alphabet with sounds, but other than that this is good so far."
rosettastone,4,0,i like the way roseola stone reaches the language.
rosettastone,4,0,it sticks with you clearly if you practice.
rosettastone,4,0,my only complaint is that they don't have enough languages for selection.
rosettastone,4,0,"i would love to learn norwegian from you, but i can't."
rosettastone,4,2,"good pp, although i wouldn use it as a sole resource (it is a good add on to domingo) but it helps a lot with pronunciation."
rosettastone,4,2,"does ask for money, but if you do it right you dont need to pay for anything."
rosettastone,4,1,great!
rosettastone,4,1,"but it'd be better if there were basic alphabet of the languages, plus, the words' translation (from pictures) into our selected native language."
rosettastone,4,0,"so far so good, but sometimes the audit doesn't pick up very well no matter how close or far away the microphone is, or how loud or quietly i speak."
rosettastone,4,0,starts with basic but engaging exercises.
rosettastone,4,0,recognition skill develop quickly but pronunciation skill need more work.
rosettastone,4,0,there are exercises focused on this to which are very useful.
rosettastone,4,0,"enjoying so far, just started."
rosettastone,4,0,"really like the pronunciation section, it definitely helps me."
rosettastone,4,0,will update as i progress and see how well i retain what i've learned
rosettastone,4,0,roseola stone provides wonderful tools for beginners.
rosettastone,4,0,"as one advances through their respective language, the learning curve begins to taper off, but only slightly."
rosettastone,4,0,"cut it how you would prefer, roseola stone is a must have for any language lover."
rosettastone,4,6,"a few days in and have learned a bit, practicing vocabulary and such."
rosettastone,4,6,i wish more of the pp was in english or had toggleable translations for the words i'm trying to learn or the phrases as pictures aren't quite enough
rosettastone,4,0,i love how easy it is to use
rosettastone,4,1,i really like it.
rosettastone,4,1,one thing is that the practices are reparative.
rosettastone,4,1,it takes a lot to get to then new practices .
rosettastone,4,1,it's really good though
rosettastone,4,0,"after using this for a week, i love it."
rosettastone,4,0,the exercises are clear for the most part.
rosettastone,4,0,i appreciate the rapid response and solution to my feedback.
rosettastone,4,0,it it very good that you don't need much skill in english to use this!
rosettastone,4,0,my daughter is learning german but she doesn't know much english so domingo for example isn't useful for her.
rosettastone,4,0,excellent pp!
rosettastone,4,6,i love this program but sometimes the voice recognition does not work.
rosettastone,4,6,"it is not just with the pp, i have the same problem with the computer program."
rosettastone,4,0,mid doesn't always work.
rosettastone,4,0,not sure if it's my device or the pp.
rosettastone,4,0,"also, some of the situations are hard to tell what the pp is trying to ask."
rosettastone,4,0,good for pronunciation.
rosettastone,4,0,"assumes a certain familiarity with learning a foreign language, so that can make things hard."
rosettastone,4,0,"it's a pretty solid pp/program for language learning, my only complaint is the voice recognition which is sketch at best."
rosettastone,4,0,"i think the pp is great for beginner work and using correct pronunciation but i wish it was simply more unfordable to continue further with this pp, but a must have for beginners"
rosettastone,4,0,seems to be a great way to start a language.
rosettastone,4,0,i like the way they review and get you to make logical extensions.
rosettastone,4,0,will see how retention is.
rosettastone,4,0,i really like this pp the only problem is its only a free trial.
rosettastone,4,0,you have to pay for full version!
rosettastone,4,0,but it's still a really great fun pp to learn a language!
rosettastone,4,0,goes really fast but fantastic otherwise
rosettastone,4,1,i love the mobile pp!
rosettastone,4,1,this way i can start and stop my lessons based on time available.
rosettastone,4,1,i was failing at logging in on my computer.
rosettastone,4,0,"easy interface, various exercises, and office option."
rosettastone,4,0,but you have to purchase it to use the most of it.
rosettastone,4,0,"easy to use...only issue is sometimes the images are too tiny to see well on my phone, but most of the time they are fine"
rosettastone,4,2,i consider myself an intermediate user but you have to buy the entire plan or the lesson to get to that part of the pp.
rosettastone,4,2,anything else you have to start from the beginning most of the stuff i already know just the basis.
rosettastone,4,0,very useful pp to learn all around.
rosettastone,4,0,"but needs abolishing on the way you repeat individual lessons, needs a retro button when you dont get the 100% without going to the next step."
rosettastone,4,1,"i just started, but i'm enjoying this program."
rosettastone,4,1,"the only issue i have is that during pronunciation reviews, the program will random say it can't hear me."
rosettastone,4,0,"it's a great pp the only thing i don't like is that it doesn't have translations, but i understand because italian is similar to spanish."
rosettastone,4,2,"very good interface, easy to understand navigation."
rosettastone,4,2,"content seems promising, so far."
rosettastone,4,2,time will tell.
rosettastone,4,0,great drilling and pronunciation checks.
rosettastone,4,0,starts off a bit easy
rosettastone,4,0,it's a good method to learn another language
rosettastone,4,0,great pp but some buttons and pictures could be bigger.
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes my county finger presses the wrong answer when i'm trying to reply the sound.
rosettastone,4,0,i am learning vietnamese some of the words don't mean the same thing.
rosettastone,4,0,it said that ong and ba is an older man or woman but i was corrected and told it's elderly man or woman.
rosettastone,4,0,this could have been bad.
rosettastone,4,0,it's still an easy awesome way to learn.
rosettastone,4,4,military get this for free online.
rosettastone,4,4,i don't know if this is because of the kindness of roseola stone or because the did paid for it.
rosettastone,4,4,but it would be nice if we can get it free on the phone pp as well so we can use it on the go.
rosettastone,4,4,maybe provide an option to enter our did id number as proof of service on the pp?
rosettastone,4,2,i great pp for learning conversational french.
rosettastone,4,2,"however, i wish it was a little slower transitioning to the next exercise so i can repeat what it said"
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes the recording feature malfunctions a little in terms of recognizing my voice or giving a grade.
rosettastone,4,0,it sometimes laws or doesn't register.
rosettastone,4,0,"great program, but poorly made pp, the play buttons are too small, near impossible to use without touching the answer button."
rosettastone,4,0,"it's easy to use and it gives instant feedback, but sometimes it might help to have a translation or explanation of the words."
rosettastone,4,3,i love this pp.
rosettastone,4,3,and with all great apes comes great costs.
rosettastone,4,3,that's the only reason they loose a star.
rosettastone,4,3,wish there were more unfordable option
rosettastone,4,0,good for beginners but you have to start from the beginning and it doesn't progress very fast through stuff you might already know
rosettastone,4,0,i am new to italian so the pp has been very helpful.
rosettastone,4,0,comprehension is very good.
rosettastone,4,0,the only challenge is the speaking.
rosettastone,4,0,i'm certain that will come with time.
rosettastone,4,0,this pp is amazing i love it and it is super easy to use the only reason i didn give it that last star is because it is a little expensive but other wise this pp is completely recommended
rosettastone,4,1,good pp and i am learning but wished picture were better.
rosettastone,4,1,makes it hard to answer when you can't see picture clearly.
rosettastone,4,1,otherwise very good
rosettastone,4,2,"it's a great pp, but it doesn't seem to recognize the mid sometimes."
rosettastone,4,2,i find that i talk to it and it doesn't even pick up my voice... on a relatively new phone
rosettastone,4,0,"i like it, i'm learning- slowly."
rosettastone,4,0,it would be better for me if it focused on recreational words and phrases since my trip is for fun not business but it works
rosettastone,4,0,can't use the pp anymore since the last update.
rosettastone,4,0,when i want to start a lesson ist always says “error - please try again“.... liked it a lot before.
rosettastone,4,0,easy to use and easy to alternate between the pp and the computer lessons.
rosettastone,4,0,being able to download lessons to use off line is handy
rosettastone,4,0,"it's a good learning pp, however it would help if there is a translation feature installed with this pp for a better learning experience."
rosettastone,4,0,i'm having a lot of fun.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish i was able to play while there is absent noise.
rosettastone,4,0,but the mid does not differentiate my voice from background noise.
rosettastone,4,0,voice recognition is not always working well.
rosettastone,4,0,at times you have to close the pp and start it to get it to work
rosettastone,4,1,i love the no translation approach.
rosettastone,4,1,i enjoy this pp when it functions correctly.
rosettastone,4,1,nonfunctional periods are rare so far.
rosettastone,4,1,so far so good.
rosettastone,4,1,even without doing the initial into to explain it were able to figure what they were doing in the pictures.
rosettastone,4,0,so far so good.
rosettastone,4,0,having a slight issue with the speech recognition but overall i love the new format.
rosettastone,4,0,i think in career builder english mode it has not to force user spell exactly complete all paragraph in stories to pass .
rosettastone,4,0,i have tried so much but did not pass .
rosettastone,4,0,please add choice to skin speaking .
rosettastone,4,0,thanks .
rosettastone,4,0,it's great but expensive.
rosettastone,4,1,this pp is great for learning an is really fun doing it.
rosettastone,4,1,"but, there is only a picture that is barely describing what you are saying but really great pp other than that."
rosettastone,4,0,"very useful, the pictures that correspond to the phrase and word helps you to associate what your talking about."
rosettastone,4,0,"great pp, but the speech recognition doesn register often and i'm stuck repeating words and phrases."
rosettastone,4,0,"i like how the teaching method integrated words and uses them differently, giving context instead of definitions- a decent miliary of immersion."
rosettastone,4,0,love the pp except even though you pronounce the words right it still fails you 50% of the time.
rosettastone,4,0,recommend using heads with mid.
rosettastone,4,0,paid service that reminds me of going through a textbook in a classroom.
rosettastone,4,0,seems to provide a fair bit of information and i think it's good for long term use.
rosettastone,4,0,"i love roseola stone, but i find that it is severely lacking in the number of languages i can learn."
rosettastone,4,0,"currently, i am learning norwegian (bokmål) and i am sad that i can not learn it using roseola stone."
rosettastone,4,0,"otherwise, i recommend this pp to anyone who wants to learn a language."
rosettastone,4,0,good pp for simple learning french quickly.
rosettastone,4,0,some thumbnail photo are too small to be easily understood on a phone screen.
rosettastone,4,0,"good interface, and excellent support for both reading and conversational language learning."
rosettastone,4,0,"pretty good, but speech is way too sensitive."
rosettastone,4,0,have to be in a very quite room.
rosettastone,4,0,runs smoothly on my phone so i'm happy
rosettastone,4,0,great for learning spanish.
rosettastone,4,0,the audit says too loud and has a hard time recognizing my voice.
rosettastone,4,0,it's great for learning a language if you complement it with other sources.
rosettastone,4,0,for some reason you can purchase classes in the pp.
rosettastone,4,0,"a little slower pace than i would like, but i like that it grades your pronunciation."
rosettastone,4,0,"so far, so good."
rosettastone,4,0,it has a learning curve that i was not used to.
rosettastone,4,0,i find myself guessing and trying to find similarities before know what the verb is
rosettastone,4,0,"good simple bite size learning you can fit around your day, hard to work out if the voice recognition issues are my microphone or the software."
rosettastone,4,0,i really enjoy your pp i just wish the prices were shifted to be less expensive but proportionately according to the amount of time.
rosettastone,4,0,for now everything is good but i think lessons are not interesting enough 😕
rosettastone,4,0,i highly recommend this pp it's useful and not framed with as the one thing i don't like is that you have to pay to learn a full language
rosettastone,4,0,"great pp, little prices but worth it!!!"
rosettastone,4,0,immersion works better than vocabulary for me personally
rosettastone,4,0,trial seems pretty helpful.
rosettastone,4,0,i'm trying to learn a language for a trip coming up.
rosettastone,4,0,4 stars only because the mobile doesn't include noweigen as an option yet!
rosettastone,4,16,after 40 min in learning by pictures and listening.
rosettastone,4,16,in learning the nous and verbs of sentences but not exactly how to put them together except by use of phrases... which is how we learned as a kid (perhaps the main parts could be highlight) ... but through the next lesson i notice more parts of the sentence that seem subtle but now stand out to me at least with pronunciation... this feels promising.
rosettastone,4,0,good for speech doesn't always tell you the translations of the words which means the sometimes ambiguous pictures have to be deciphered.
rosettastone,4,0,yes it really is good.
rosettastone,4,0,but thought it was free.
rosettastone,4,0,just unit 1 is available.
rosettastone,4,0,but that's fine.
rosettastone,4,0,thanks
rosettastone,4,1,the payment into should not seem foreign.
rosettastone,4,1,"i don't know what i am being charged, was sent three different prices."
rosettastone,4,1,i'm sure i'll be changed the highest price.
rosettastone,4,1,otherwise the language learning product is quality.
rosettastone,4,0,sometimes the speaking and pronunciation isn clear but overall very well made and thought out.
rosettastone,4,0,"works pretty well on the mobile pp, just the occasional issue having to repeat into the mid."
rosettastone,4,0,easy to use.
rosettastone,4,0,easy memorization.
rosettastone,4,0,would like more of a word to picture game for beginners.
rosettastone,4,0,i think the picture isn't enough.
rosettastone,4,0,they can do a lot better by adding exact english interpretation of the word in the studied language
rosettastone,4,1,"i love the learning experience, i just have issues with it freezing occasionally."
rosettastone,4,1,i recommend giving it a chance!
rosettastone,4,2,"good except buttons on andros are so small that when i try to hear speech, it submits it as my answer and i get it wrong."
rosettastone,4,0,"great pp, but not really for a beginner!"
rosettastone,4,0,i understand a little so it's suitable for me.
rosettastone,4,0,"it is a very good and thorough way of learning a language, though it goes a little fast."
rosettastone,4,0,"its a great pp the only issues i have had is with the mid,sometimes i doesn really understands what you are trying to say"
rosettastone,4,0,"good, though the way the immersion is used isn clear sometimes leading to confusion."
rosettastone,4,0,roseola stone doesn't tell you any translations you have to figure it out and sometimes it is unclear.
rosettastone,4,0,pretty good though
rosettastone,4,0,love the recognition feature that allows you to check your pronunciation at different levels as you improve.
rosettastone,4,0,the immersion experience really helps me learn the language.
rosettastone,4,0,i wish i could highlight words when in not sure of their meaning though
rosettastone,4,0,i would like the option to see the translation in english at any given time during the lessons.
rosettastone,4,0,i believe that would be most helpful.
rosettastone,4,2,i started using this pp to learn japanese for travel but i'm having issues fully understanding it just because it doesn't actually directly translate and tell me what each word means
rosettastone,4,5,i really enjoyed this pp and was actually remembering things i learned in college spanish class.
rosettastone,4,5,then came the part where you had to pay for more lessons......not cool.
rosettastone,4,5,i installed and will find another pp.
rosettastone,4,0,good pp for perfecting your pronunciation.
rosettastone,4,0,it breaks difficult words into syllables and sound to help.
rosettastone,4,1,"love the pp and does teach you stuff, also no adds, but very expensive to buy the full lessons."
rosettastone,4,1,😄😥
rosettastone,4,0,it's really useful.
rosettastone,4,0,"i like how reaches us, shows up the language in its own language."
rosettastone,4,0,good space-repetition learning.
rosettastone,4,0,would be nice to have links to grammar and vocabulary associated with each section.
rosettastone,4,0,everything is great but the only problem is that it laws with out internet sometimes with internet.
rosettastone,4,0,it's great for sight but i'm not sure on the audit side that i would be able to keep up in a conversation
rosettastone,4,0,seems to have trouble picking up my accent/tone.
rosettastone,4,0,i get some pronunciation correct but it says i did not.
rosettastone,4,0,"so far so good, but i wish that the pictures would be explained so i'd have a better understanding of the sentences."
rosettastone,4,0,"this pp helped me learn a ton while i lived in japan, though it doesn pick up on some pronunciation sometimes."
rosettastone,4,1,it's a great way to learn the language you prefer.
rosettastone,4,1,it helps out clot with the picture in with the text
rosettastone,4,1,"after having my eyes set on roseola stone for several years i've come to discover that there are better products for less, such as domingo or memories."
rosettastone,4,0,"easy pp to navigable through, and the quality is excellent."
rosettastone,4,0,great pp to use if trying learn a language but i suggest you learn a bit of the language you are trying to learn beforehand the make it a bit easier.
rosettastone,4,2,mostly very good.
rosettastone,4,2,the voice recognition is very problematical which slow down learning
rosettastone,4,0,i think it really does help with learning the language you want too i barely started using it and i have learned clot
rosettastone,4,0,let's you have the basic learning for free and the rest you need to pay to clock everything but its great 👍
rosettastone,4,1,"really good, but the pronunciation part could use more of a breakdown."
rosettastone,4,0,i have been loving it so far.
rosettastone,4,0,the utterances are clear.
rosettastone,4,0,my first lesson and it's good.
rosettastone,4,0,i would later you 5 stars ✨ 🌟 if it was free
rosettastone,4,4,the pp is great.
rosettastone,4,4,but as i live in ran i can buy the premium and all access.
rosettastone,4,4,its very disappointing.
rosettastone,4,4,i hope there is a chance for us too use the pp
rosettastone,4,14,its fun to learn with.
rosettastone,4,14,a bit frustration when it registers your pronunciation wrong.
rosettastone,4,0,the material is easy to understand and the layout allows students to customize the work to fit their needs.
rosettastone,4,0,"fast learning, and the pp offers different levels to your understanding... over all, an amazing pp for learning a different language!"
rosettastone,4,0,it is a great way to learn different languages.
rosettastone,4,0,right now i am learning the organ language.
rosettastone,4,0,i can't believe how much i learned!!
rosettastone,4,0,!🤩
rosettastone,4,1,should have english with the lesson so that people can know exactly what they are learning to say.
rosettastone,4,1,"otherwise, it's great!"
rosettastone,4,1,"the pp is supper great but there is one disadvantage , it doesn't show all the icons especially in samson , so i have to go back to the computer, ply fix this problem"
rosettastone,4,0,its great!
rosettastone,4,0,i wish they would say it in english and then spanish so i can see the words together
rosettastone,4,0,great way to learn but at the same time begginners are going to have to try to learn with out a translation to english
rosettastone,4,0,i think it's great but room for improvement .
rosettastone,4,0,i am re-learning a language and it's proving very useful.
rosettastone,4,0,"well laid out, and very pick about pronunciation which is a good thing."
rosettastone,4,0,it goes fast into immersion but you can repeat the lessons until you feel comfortable moving on.
rosettastone,4,0,"great, but pricking is confusing upon visiting a couple years later."
rosettastone,4,1,there should be a limestone option at the end of each unit.... like the pp version
rosettastone,4,0,"i really enjoy it, though sometimes it just doesn't register my voice"
rosettastone,4,0,good and clear pronunciation.
rosettastone,4,0,i like it.
rosettastone,4,0,am sure my pronunciation is improving as i move ahead learning
rosettastone,4,0,"the teaching method is great, my only complaint is that there's not an easy way to review if you get out of the habit of studying."

rosettastone,4,0,4 stars 4 speed.
rosettastone,4,0,"native spanish speakers,do really talk fast."
rosettastone,4,0,"when your learning another language, particularly when your culture speaks and hears slower, spanish is much harder to follow and learn."
rosettastone,4,0,ex: a guy from george us is going to have a difficult time understanding a guy from ny because they tend to speak faster and have a different dialect & it's the same language.

rosettastone,4,3,"the great thing about is is its not language-depended, i.e."
rosettastone,4,3,you don't need to know english (or any language) to learn a new language.
rosettastone,4,3,the problem it has (which all language apes share to a degree) is it's bad at teaching how a language works.
rosettastone,4,3,"i don't mean grammar per se, i mean the way native speakers use the language, the irregularities, the quires."
rosettastone,4,3,that makes the connection with the language hard.
rosettastone,4,3,there are also some inconsistency between apes/platforms that while minor are still annoying.
rosettastone,4,0,very practical learning experience and easy
rosettastone,4,0,"it's great for the deal they are offering, brings them at or below the cost of the other paying services"
rosettastone,4,0,it is extremely fun i'm only 12 and i already know 4 languages!
rosettastone,4,0,!
