duolingo,5,241,"i know loads of people, young and older, who are trying the pp."
duolingo,5,241,huge language option.
duolingo,5,241,i like it that you can set up how many minutes a day i want to practise.
duolingo,5,56,"if you give it serious time (not 5 minutes a day like they advertise, but more like an hour or two daily), this learning method actually works well to get you started with a language."
duolingo,5,56,"the gazing mechanics keeps you coming back for more, it's fun to compete on the leaderboards and in a couple of months you'll start to understand and maybe even basically speak another language!"
duolingo,5,25,"amazing learning tool for those who want to set a foundation for learning a language, me personally chose russian and i feel like i am learning a good amount, you just need to dedicate time and effort, i also recommend tiny cards and then follow the language you're learning to help practice and perfect the language of your choice."
duolingo,5,25,hopefully i will have russian killed in eventually.
duolingo,5,25,just need to put in the work.
duolingo,5,25,"overall, great free pp and i love domingo!!"

duolingo,5,6,"however, this domingo pp is teaching me words, phrases and some structure that is new to me in the language."
duolingo,5,6,"also, i use this pp to learn the written language (anti)."
duolingo,5,6,which i am really enjoying!!
duolingo,5,6,this pp is not just for beginners.
duolingo,5,6,those of us who speak the language can benefit as well.
duolingo,5,6,thank you domingo !
duolingo,5,3,this offers opportunities to learn in many different style.
duolingo,5,3,"between needing to speak it, having to translate it both ways and needing to write what you hear."
duolingo,5,3,it build on top of itself at a good place incorporating words from past lesson and incorporating new words in an easy to understand concept.
duolingo,5,3,i am excited to use this pp to learn as i move to south florida and hope to become client by end of the year.
duolingo,5,3,an excellent language pp.

duolingo,5,4,i am learning spanish and it is really helping.
duolingo,5,4,i struggle with profound and this is really helping me.
duolingo,5,4,"the lessons have a nice mix of reading, listening and writing."
duolingo,5,4,and the progression is nice and slow.
duolingo,5,4,i had to download a dual language keyboard so i do the writing properly.
duolingo,5,4,i can wait to go to spain and practice what i've learnt
duolingo,5,4,the pp uses just the right amount of one's base language to get you started.
duolingo,5,4,then one hardly notices english even when you're doing a translation exercise.
duolingo,5,4,it has an element of multiple choice exercises.
duolingo,5,4,it can be very easy if one sticks to it and just demanding enough to make learning a language a pleasure.
duolingo,5,4,at one point it replaced solitary as my go to pp when on 20 minute bus rides my advice to all is to bite off what you can chew.
duolingo,5,4,chew it over by a little real world practise.
duolingo,5,2,very nice pp!
duolingo,5,2,"i'd like to point out a few suggestions i personally would like to experience in the future inside your pp: one is to be able to search for a word's meaning (you remember a word in german for example, but you're not sure about its meaning..), and second thing is to be able to see all the words you have learned so far, with its translation beside (all=all..) other than that, appreciate your work, useful pp!"
duolingo,5,2,thank you!
duolingo,5,8,in all honesty the adds get annoying.
duolingo,5,8,"but for a free pp, that genuinely reaches you the language and how to spell and pronounce things correctly."
duolingo,5,8,it is great.
duolingo,5,8,there really are no shortcuts and you have to stick with it.
duolingo,5,8,if you want to learn a language you can.
duolingo,5,8,this pp is great and makes it easy to get into your routine.
duolingo,5,8,just beware of the owl if you leave your modifications on.
duolingo,5,8,he will remind you.
duolingo,5,8,quick update: i wish it told you how many minutes and hours total you have been practicing.
duolingo,5,1,best and most information language learning pp.
duolingo,5,1,i have been using it for a couple years to learn swahili.
duolingo,5,1,it has been improved over the years to be more user friendly and accurate to the languages they offer.
duolingo,5,1,i never get bored of it!
duolingo,5,1,"the interface is fun and game-like, and you actually will be amazed at how much of your chosen language you begin to retain and grow client in!"
duolingo,5,1,i would recommend dealing to anyone wishing to learn a language.
duolingo,5,1,i am having fun regarding on learning a different language.
duolingo,5,1,it really uplifts the mood and makes a very efficient time killer.
duolingo,5,1,"5/5 even with the as, it's not a bother and some have like a benefit on the long run like extra gems."
duolingo,5,1,i won't say that a premium version is obsolete but rather i would like my language tutor to be as free as possible given the fact that different language materials and tutorials are scarce on the internet these day and age.
duolingo,5,1,wonderful pp thank you des!
duolingo,5,7,this hands down!
duolingo,5,7,the best pp i've ever download!
duolingo,5,7,"i'm learning several languages, and domingo makes it easy and fun!"
duolingo,5,7,"you get weekly updated on your progress, there's a store where you can buy stuff with the gems you earn...all this with the free version!"
duolingo,5,7,"i'm seriously considering upbraiding to the pay version because, if the free version is so great, i bet the upgrade is even better!"
duolingo,5,7,"as are not irritating and easy to close, too."
duolingo,5,7,highly recommend!!
duolingo,5,7,!
duolingo,5,1,i love this pp.
duolingo,5,1,i have been using the free version for 2 weeks and have learnt so much already.
duolingo,5,1,"it reaches you how to read, write and speak the language in a way that's fun and easy and encourages you to keep going."
duolingo,5,1,you can also clock stories which help with your reading and listening.
duolingo,5,1,couldn't recommend enough for someone who wants to learn a new language
duolingo,5,2,easy and engaging to use.
duolingo,5,2,i'm on day 7 and can already recognize arabic letters and the sounds they make!
duolingo,5,2,i'm old so it is exciting that my brain is learning so easily with domingo!
duolingo,5,2,"i like setting my own goals, and am very happy that there are plenty of practice sessions included with my plus version."
duolingo,5,2,i highly recommend this pp.
duolingo,5,0,i really like the pp as additional practice method.
duolingo,5,0,combined with a proper course and book for grammar it's a great tool to study whenever you got a few free minutes.
duolingo,5,0,"i would recommend to try it, if you want to learn a language, the i still suggest to use other sources, like books, native speakers and courses, as well."
duolingo,5,1,this is still a great language pp.
duolingo,5,1,although it doesn't explain certain rules out exceptions so if you're serious about learning another language it's best to have a book or some other more detailed information to hand.
duolingo,5,1,"however, i would recommend this to anyone wanting to either learn, or just find it about another language."
duolingo,5,1,i have been using the pp for a week and so far is good.
duolingo,5,1,learning is broke up in different categories and uses repetition and adding the old stuff into the new stuff to remember the words.
duolingo,5,1,i am learning spanish and german and slowly starting italian.
duolingo,5,1,"with many option, it's easy to learn a new language at your own pace."
duolingo,5,11,i think domingo is absolutely wonderful and helpful.
duolingo,5,11,i've been learning spanish for a few weeks now and the is so much content that i have covered.
duolingo,5,11,many of the reviews mention the 5 live system and i believe it's a great thing because there is also a 'practice' section which makes you revise what you have learnt in order to get lives.
duolingo,5,11,"although it's time consuming, it tests your knowledge and ensures that you are learning as much as possible."
duolingo,5,1,this pp is very fun and educational.
duolingo,5,1,it makes learning a new language easy and fun!
duolingo,5,1,"when i lose all my lives, i just want to keep going!"
duolingo,5,1,"and i also appreciate the pp being free, along with all the languages and lessons!"
duolingo,5,1,and there aren't many as either!
duolingo,5,1,i would give you 100 stars if i could.
duolingo,5,1,i really appreciate this pp.
duolingo,5,1,i learned a lot from this pp.
duolingo,5,1,gracious.
duolingo,5,1,this pp is the best to learn a certain language.
duolingo,5,1,i hope that you will have a vocabulary words so that we can review some of the words if we are not up to answering questions.
duolingo,5,1,the books of the pp is also very helpful.
duolingo,5,1,thank you so much for making this pp free and giving us opportunity to learn a language easily!!
duolingo,5,1,!❤❤
duolingo,5,0,"i use this application as a supplement to broader self-study tools, to reinforce grammar concepts and pronunciation."
duolingo,5,0,it works incredibly well to foster a deeper understanding and more natural learning curve of the language being studied.
duolingo,5,0,"incredible pp, and so grateful that it's all at no cost!"
duolingo,5,3,it is an amazing pp.
duolingo,5,3,"a little expensive for premium, but if you can ignore the adds it's awesome just using the free version."
duolingo,5,3,"i feel like you will definitely need more than just this pp to learn a language, but it definitely will get you on your way to an intermediate level."
duolingo,5,3,"it's fun, easy to use, and gets the into in your head, so i rate this 5 stars."
duolingo,5,3,it also has a small competitive aspect to it that i have really enjoyed.
duolingo,5,0,"well, it is not a bad application... i mean, it is too similar to a game but if you pay attention and follow the advice the pp itself gives (read each lesson out loud and write the new vocabulary you learn after practicing), then you will probably get the basic knowledge such as sounds and simple vocabulary."
duolingo,5,0,"so, it is recommended to beginners but you can't stop here."
duolingo,5,1,i love it.
duolingo,5,1,especially for a free pp there is lots of content so i don't feel the pressure to upgrade just yet.
duolingo,5,1,one thing i would like to change is how they teach grammar rules.
duolingo,5,1,"it seems like they only test you, but never give you a lesson beforehand."
duolingo,5,1,so you end up just blandly guessing until there has been enough repetition that you catch on to the rules.
duolingo,5,1,the best pp on my phone.
duolingo,5,1,"good difficulty curves, content and it is overall very cleverly written pp."
duolingo,5,1,i only wish they expand the section with stories and maybe at some level make the stories into audit-so you have to listen to a few paragraphs and answer questions based on what you heard.
duolingo,5,2,it is an extremely useful pp if you want to learn any language correctly and practically.
duolingo,5,2,it isn't just about the written part of the language but also pronunciation and phrase forming.
duolingo,5,2,the method of teaching is great and subtly repetition which helps memories very quickly.
duolingo,5,2,i absolutely recommend this pp for new earners of any language.
duolingo,5,1,"i love this pp, i only wish sometimes there was more guidance and explanation on specific things."
duolingo,5,1,"i usually end up having to look things up for myself, but that doesn't bring my rating down because without the pp i wouldn't be knowing what i had to look up in the first place edit: i forgot to mention that i love the webster more than the pp, if the pp was more like the webster that would be epic"
duolingo,5,4,i would highly recommend this as a method of learning a second language.
duolingo,5,4,"it is engaging, fun and effective."
duolingo,5,4,the repetition is very helpful for retaining new vocabulary and hearing the sentences is great for learning pronunciation.
duolingo,5,4,i have learnt more grammar in a very short period than i have with other language learning software.
duolingo,5,18,this has been a great way for me to brush up on my language skill.
duolingo,5,18,i love the extra components like the podcast and the stories that are interactive.
duolingo,5,18,it has become a daily ritual for me and i don't see myself falling out of practice any time soon.
duolingo,5,18,the only buggy thing for me are the pronunciation exercises.
duolingo,5,18,"i'm not sure if it's how i am holding my phone, if my mouth is too close to the microphone or what but it gets disheartening ""failing"" those activities with no help in how to correct."
duolingo,5,0,love domingo and my portuguese is getting so much better!
duolingo,5,0,don't know what happened though but after one of the recent updated i can't recorder the words in word bank mode anymore.
duolingo,5,0,also the tests to skin a level are sometimes too easy with most translations providing the word bank!
duolingo,5,0,"other than that, this pp is absolutely great!"
duolingo,5,0,(wish there was a portuguese from italian!
duolingo,5,0,the two languages are so similar and it would be much easier to learn being italian my first language!)
duolingo,5,0,"amazing pp, easy to use, huge variety of languages to learn, doesn't overwhelm you."
duolingo,5,0,i love that you can not only access it on your phone but also on a computer.
duolingo,5,0,"extremely simple to use, i love how it works with your pace."
duolingo,5,0,"i can't recommend this pp enough, nor can i express how much i love this pp."
duolingo,5,0,very nice pp.
duolingo,5,0,it's really adjective and if you are competitive person you have to be careful.
duolingo,5,0,there are a lot of things that might be useful if you are learning new language.
duolingo,5,0,"it is easy, funny and useful."
duolingo,5,0,highly recommended this pp when you are learning either at home or outside.
duolingo,5,0,this surely is the best free language learning pp available.
duolingo,5,0,it makes learning real easy and fun.
duolingo,5,0,it has as but at a minimal but you don't have to watch them so its not bothering you.
duolingo,5,0,plus it keeps you motivate and its just amazing.
duolingo,5,0,you can set the bar low but when you start you almost dont want to quit.
duolingo,5,0,so in my opinion its definitely worth a try!
duolingo,5,5,domingo is fun and interactive.
duolingo,5,5,i have been using this pp almost daily for over a year now and i am comfortably starting to converse with my spanish-speaking patients.
duolingo,5,5,i love how many different ways of learning it includes.
duolingo,5,5,it appeals to my hands-on learning style and the visual eye.
duolingo,5,5,"there is lots of positive feedback, encouragement, and rewards."
duolingo,5,5,domingo is helping me meet my language goals in a very positive atmosphere.
duolingo,5,0,loving this so far!
duolingo,5,0,"i'm 31, and hard of hearing failed french in school because i was unable to hear certain sounds / so reporting it back i was always wrong."
duolingo,5,0,"i find this so much different i put my earphones in and i'm able to fully hear the sounds, and therefore i've been able to repeat it back correctly."
duolingo,5,0,it's nice being able to learn something that i was told i would be unable to do.
duolingo,5,0,and now at the age of 31 i have friends who are french so i have even more of a reason to really try to learn
duolingo,5,0,organ lessons are getting much better.
duolingo,5,0,it would be great if the pp would do a better job when listening to me speak (sometimes i really mess it up and it can't tell) but otherwise awesome!
duolingo,5,0,"overall though, i'm generally really happy with it."
duolingo,5,0,comprehensive.
duolingo,5,0,"the little lightbulb icon next to the individual skill (on some interface, instead of a lightbulb it's ""tips"") provide lessons (grammar etc."
duolingo,5,0,"), giving it great structure."
duolingo,5,0,wide selection of languages.
duolingo,5,0,i use it every day and makes learning languages enjoyable.
duolingo,5,0,"can't believe it's free, i highly recommend!"
duolingo,5,0,(:
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is a great pp for learning, absolute 5 stars, its great, i love it, the lessons are very intriguing and i love, just love the cut little animation on the lessons, when i'm doing my japanese lessons, i always loved the lessons little pictures, but those little animation are perfect!"
duolingo,5,0,yes.
duolingo,5,0,"but one thing, i wish japanese lessons had stories, it would make everything so much more interesting!"
duolingo,5,1,i love the pp because it is friendly towards you and i have already after 15+ minutes learnt a fair bit about german!
duolingo,5,1,"i have always wanted to learn german and now that i am, it feels great!"
duolingo,5,1,"this pp isn't time consuming and you can get on and off of it at any time you feel comfortable, and depending on how often you use the pp, you could learn a whole new language in no time!"
duolingo,5,1,i highly recommend this pp to anyone who would like to learn a new language!
duolingo,5,1,:)
duolingo,5,0,"was expecting something that gave u the basis them u had to pay to go on, so happy this isn't the case!"
duolingo,5,0,"it's really good and allows a varied method of teaching , i love the competition with up and story mode."
duolingo,5,0,so helpful for learning a language.
duolingo,5,0,it unlocked new material as u go on so i don't feel overwhelmed with words but a fast enough teaching pace to develop with.
duolingo,5,0,best pp for this i've found.
duolingo,5,0,i am really enjoying the ratified experience domingo brings to learning a new language.
duolingo,5,0,i appreciate that it has the listening and speaking parts so strongly integrated into the lessons.
duolingo,5,0,i'm impressed that it can hear me speaking even in noisy situations.
duolingo,5,0,a very enjoyable pp.
duolingo,5,0,"i started using domingo just over 30 days ago and am quite impressed with the format and intuition nature of the program, as well as the additional materials such as podcast to enhance and enrich the learning."
duolingo,5,0,i am very happy with this pp thus far.
duolingo,5,0,very good pp except for some reason computer experience seems more thorough.
duolingo,5,0,get stories for japanese!
duolingo,5,0,"sometimes you want a bit more emphasis on the lists of words you've already learnt, and it would be nice to understand the different numbers next to surnames on the forum."
duolingo,5,3,this pp is great for learning a language their are such a small amount of as it never others you and besides you choose when you watch video as for doubling stuff like gems or hearts.
duolingo,5,3,some people hate the hearts in this game you get 5 every 25 hours and each time you mess up in a lesson it takes away a heart.
duolingo,5,3,when you run out of hearts you fail that level of the lesson and have to red it which i am perfectly fine with as you can do practice lessons for more hearts.
duolingo,5,3,helping you too learn!
duolingo,5,3,!
duolingo,5,0,"a wonderful learning platform.......step by step lessons.....enough of practice to make you remember everything that you have learnt.....it reaches you reading, writing, speaking, listening, all of them.....and the best is all of this is completely free......must use pp"
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is simplistic in approach, but that simplicity by no means a detriment."
duolingo,5,0,its design makes learning a fun and easy experience with achievement milestones to track your progress and a subtle aspect of competition by way of leaderboards that display others' progress and banking.
duolingo,5,0,"domingo makes you want to learn more, to progress, to better your understanding of whatever languages you choose to learn in a brilliant fashion."
duolingo,5,0,buds to the creator!
duolingo,5,0,i never expected that learning a new language could be this fun!
duolingo,5,0,"i don't use it often, mostly before sleeping, but it's fun to learn the new language to prepare myself for trips or when i encounter a random spanish person (guess what language i'm trying to learn)."
duolingo,5,0,"i also see some reviews complaining about the ""new"" hearts system."
duolingo,5,0,"bull i say, it has always been there!"
duolingo,5,19,brilliant pp.
duolingo,5,19,free and easy to use.
duolingo,5,19,does have as but they are very short.
duolingo,5,19,"great content and easy to learn, tests your skill on speaking, listening and writing the language."
duolingo,5,19,i'm learning french at the moment but there is loads of languages you can learn and learn several at once.
duolingo,5,19,you earn up when learning which takes you up the leaderboard against other people.
duolingo,5,19,i highly recommend this pp as i've learned so much already!
duolingo,5,2,"i've compared other apes to this one and i'd love to say, bravo!"
duolingo,5,2,i have not learned much but i get words in my head quickly unlike the others.
duolingo,5,2,it doesn't usually crash and it's got good speed!
duolingo,5,2,and i like it that you can study like 5 languages at the same time not like the other apes.
duolingo,5,2,спасибо!
duolingo,5,5,i think this pp is very helpful.
duolingo,5,5,"i studied makarin in college for 4 years, and this gave me an aptitude test to clock lessons starting with my level of proficient so i did not have to start from the beginning (i still did for review's sake, but it was nice that i did not have to)."
duolingo,5,5,"this helps me keep my makarin decent, and it reaches me some phrases they did not teach in school."
duolingo,5,5,i also appreciate that it helps me with my reading quite a bit.
duolingo,5,14,"fun and information application for solo learning, complete with vocabulary, grammar, audit clips, conversations, stories, and statistics for friendly competition between other students."
duolingo,5,14,better than public school!
duolingo,5,14,best part is that this is free and the as are not intrusion.

duolingo,5,17,lately i am once again falling in love with domingo.
duolingo,5,17,i love this last update!
duolingo,5,17,"the fact that the keyboard switch automatically is a really good way of saving time, especially when you have more than 10 keyboard to chose from."
duolingo,5,17,finally they changed the number of lessons too!
duolingo,5,17,it was a bit annoying having to do 20 lessons to complete one level.
duolingo,5,17,"and i love the podcasts, learning french has become more easier for me, that i was struggling a bit with the similarity to spanish."

duolingo,5,25,"even in free mode, there is exactly 1 ad at the end of each lesson, and you don't have to wait 5, 15, or 30 seconds to close it, you can x right away."
duolingo,5,25,"that shows class (ll), integrity, and a education to learning from the developer."
duolingo,5,25,"i was offered a week trial of domingo plus, will def porch."
duolingo,5,3,love using this pp.
duolingo,5,3,i've been able to practice pronunciation of swedish which turns out to be my favourite language right now.
duolingo,5,3,i love that you can learn a number of languages at the same time and you get these non intrusion reminders which are helpful.
duolingo,5,3,i recommend this pp to anyone who wants to get into new languages.
duolingo,5,0,love the independence this pp gives me in actually learning another language.
duolingo,5,0,"it's strength are definitely in reading and listening to the language since there's only so much chatting you can do with ai, but that's something!"
duolingo,5,0,i am finding myself per up to and decipher words and sentences of spanish speakers when i am out and about in a regular basis.
duolingo,5,0,very rewarding.
duolingo,5,0,and the learning is relatively painless since it is set up as a game.
duolingo,5,0,"i would say i have been using this pp for more than 5 years(if i'm not mistaken), so i enjoy this opportunity, firstly, you learn while having fun, secondly, it is free and quantitative, thirdly, i love it's log(that lovely owl) i feel like it is my pet and reminding me to improve myself, love you do😍😍😙😙"
duolingo,5,0,"this is a great pp for learning languages that are maybe from your culture, school, or multiple more other things."
duolingo,5,0,i was on this pp of only 3 days and know way more than what i originally did.
duolingo,5,0,"i love how it prounouces it, and gives you tips."
duolingo,5,0,"so, if your wanting to experience or learn a language domingo is perfect for you!"
duolingo,5,0,this pp is so easy and fun.
duolingo,5,0,"it sounds like i'm advertising, but i'm actually british and historically, we're lazy to learn new language scared of trying - my main issue."
duolingo,5,0,"however, domingo has made this process painless and accessible."
duolingo,5,0,i recommend to all that need or want to learn another language.
duolingo,5,0,go for it!
duolingo,5,6,"i never thought i'd be able to stick to language learning, but this pp is definitely next level when it comes to dopamine hits and fun game-like incentive to continue and beat those you're in competition with."
duolingo,5,6,"it truly feels like a fun video game, and in the meantime, you see clear and consistent language learning progress."
duolingo,5,6,"once i get competent in polish, i'm going to start another language, and then maybe another after that!"
duolingo,5,1,domingo has been a great tool for me to learn spanish at my own speed.
duolingo,5,1,"there are many times i am not able their stay with my several days streak however, i always have the option of going back and starting with the into or phrases again if i feel i need to."
duolingo,5,1,i like it because i can learn at my own pace and not feel pressure.
duolingo,5,2,give only been using the pp for a few days but i have already retained a lot of the material faster than i would have thought.
duolingo,5,2,i was always so timid to start learning a new language even though french is always one give wanted to pick up.
duolingo,5,2,this pp has definitely broken those barriers for me and made it enjoyable at the same time!
duolingo,5,0,i'm really enjoying learning spanish with this pp.
duolingo,5,0,the only thing i'd say is it'd be nice to have a range of exercises (not just sentences) and if paring exercise was more related to the level you're at rather than genetic mix of words from all levels (usually the easier ones).
duolingo,5,0,thanks anyway for a great free pp
duolingo,5,1,thank you unlike the other people complaining.
duolingo,5,1,i anna say thank you for creating an pp that helps you learn another language and makes it fun.
duolingo,5,1,"it has prove to work.,very very effective."
duolingo,5,1,"my french and japanese has increased so much but if you can please increase on the explanations (especially for japanese), that would be mighty fine."
duolingo,5,1,thank you again
duolingo,5,11,i really am enjoying the pp.
duolingo,5,11,"it is helping me to learn new languages, with out making it boring or difficult."
duolingo,5,11,"in only a week, i now know multiple words and phrase in another language, where as if i were to have taken a class, it would have taken almost a month to learn what i know now."
duolingo,5,11,"the light competitiveness, mixed with achievements, helps to keep me motivate to keep going."
duolingo,5,11,"it works with how you want to learn, with multiple difficulties and the time system."
duolingo,5,1,i really think this pp is great.
duolingo,5,1,"it works well and i like how its free, no random pop up as, and when you're out of hearts, you can practice to regain them."
duolingo,5,1,the idea is wonderful.
duolingo,5,1,"not only that, you can have friends on it, and your own profile."
duolingo,5,1,it's great for learning new languages.
duolingo,5,0,i've been using domingo (free not premium) to maintain my german & get exposed to other languages for years now.
duolingo,5,0,"mio it's one of the best language learning resources out there, free or otherwise!"
duolingo,5,0,i love that they've never compromised on offering their main products for free even after adding a premium version.
duolingo,5,0,they've ensued there's tons you can do for free & i've never felt like they've ragged me with as or limited what i can learn in order to get me to pay.
duolingo,5,0,can't say enough in 500 words ll
duolingo,5,140,i like the way it conditions you into a language and the way vocabulary is subtly introduced and repeated.
duolingo,5,140,it is very well-placed to accommodate different levels of earners.
duolingo,5,140,"the structure of the pp is well thought out, like it was as written by a linguistic/teacher."
duolingo,5,140,the constant do motivation and reminders work well to help with time management.
duolingo,5,140,"over all, it makes learning languages fun and gives you the opportunity to interact with other people as well, which adds a social dynamic."
duolingo,5,1,this pp is fantastic!
duolingo,5,1,"you learn to read, speak, and write the words!"
duolingo,5,1,"repetition, which really helps you remember!"
duolingo,5,1,"if you run low on health, you can practice to gain hearts!"
duolingo,5,1,this pp is amazing and i recommend it to anyone wanting to learn a new language(s)!
duolingo,5,1,two thumbs waaaaay way up!
duolingo,5,1,👍🏻👍🏻
duolingo,5,5,"i've been an andros user for a long time, and i've never left a review on an pp so far."
duolingo,5,5,but this pp truly deserves all the appraisal and a full 5 stars!
duolingo,5,5,never have i enjoyed learning as much as i do with domingo!
duolingo,5,5,"some people complain about the hearts system, but if you select to practice, you can both reap and earn hearts in a matter of minutes."
duolingo,5,5,i started my spanish lessons 2 hours ago and i'm blown away with how easy and fun it is.
duolingo,5,5,6/5!!!
duolingo,5,5,♥️😁
duolingo,5,10,this pp is truly amazing.
duolingo,5,10,you can learn a whole new language just by practicing everyday.
duolingo,5,10,"you can set reminders so you don't forget as well as lose your spot on the leaderboard, where you can compete with the amount of up you have with others."
duolingo,5,10,"the pp if free and there are minimal as, so dont worry about paying for anything."
duolingo,5,10,this pp is very helpful and i feel that i can become client in the language i am learning using this pp and this pp alone.
duolingo,5,0,"it is by far, the absolutely best language learning pp."
duolingo,5,0,"i've tried many others, i just never found the right fit."
duolingo,5,0,this pp really did meet my needs.
duolingo,5,0,"i wanted to learn german, but i didn't want to listen, nor speak."
duolingo,5,0,do never forced me to!
duolingo,5,0,"i needed it in a story structure, while learning the vocabulary and sentence structures, so i could progress onto harder stories."
duolingo,5,0,"this did exactly that, to my surprise."
duolingo,5,0,i hadn't found an pp that could do what i envisioned.
duolingo,5,0,violent dance!
duolingo,5,1,i absolutely love it!
duolingo,5,1,but i would like to make a suggestion: it would make it very simple for me at least if there was a dictionary of the language i'm learning in the pp.
duolingo,5,1,it would help with trying to remember words without having to be in lessons.
duolingo,5,1,"other than that, i absolutely love the pp."
duolingo,5,1,it has helped me so much!
duolingo,5,8,i love games/apes that challenge you and keep your brain sharp so this is a great pp to do that and a productive way to kill time!
duolingo,5,8,"my only suggestion is i would love to see balkan languages added (creation, serbian, and/or bosnia)."
duolingo,5,8,"other than that, very easy to use and a lot of fun!"
duolingo,5,8,you get as on the free version but they don't bother me much.
duolingo,5,0,phenomena!
duolingo,5,0,i've been using this pp for a year or two and its so educational and fun.
duolingo,5,0,the recently added stories are great!
duolingo,5,0,"its still super easy to use if you don't have domingo+ , though i got it free for a week and it was nice."
duolingo,5,6,this is so awesome that i don't mind the as.
duolingo,5,6,"it's fun competing against people around the world, guessing where they are by their activity patterns, and what their language is."
duolingo,5,6,"knowing the effort i've put in, it is really impressive to see the scores and variety of languages folks are pursuing."
duolingo,5,6,even clinton!
duolingo,5,6,"i haven't been able to add my pick to my profile, but the world is better off for that."
duolingo,5,6,i recently changed phone and they had a way to get me set right back where i was.
duolingo,5,6,awesome.
duolingo,5,0,providing language education for free is one of the best ideas ever.
duolingo,5,0,"i've been using domingo with french, portuguese and german and even if i haven't become client at any of those languages (yet) i think i have got a good base of grammar and vocabulary in an entertaining way."
duolingo,5,0,also it includes now podcasts and other tools to help you with your listening.
duolingo,5,1,i think for a person with a bit of background on the language they learn (most importantly the alphabet in most languages and/or some of the pronunciation) this pp is a go to for you to improve your language ... not necessarily to become client but you'll be able to have basic conversations with people of the language you're learning
duolingo,5,0,"love, love, love it!!!"
duolingo,5,0,it is easy and engaging.
duolingo,5,0,it covers vision and sound recognition of words and sentences.
duolingo,5,0,reaches practical vocabulary and use of grammar in changes of contents.
duolingo,5,0,"makes it fun, enforcing, and easy to learn; allowing you to work at your own pace."
duolingo,5,0,"appreciate that it encourages skill of listening, understanding, speaking, reading, and writing to gain the ability to translate in either languages."
duolingo,5,0,really love that you can choose up to four languages to learn concurrently.
duolingo,5,1,edit: why did the speaking exercises disappear from the pp?
duolingo,5,1,i'm learning german at lightning speed!
duolingo,5,1,"easy, fun, effective, and you can do a little here and a little there, so you're learning before you know it."
duolingo,5,0,it is really fun.
duolingo,5,0,i enjoy using domingo everyday.
duolingo,5,0,even though i sometimes lose my streak.
duolingo,5,0,"the strange thing is, when i'm playing a game, a domingo ad pips up."
duolingo,5,0,"but other then that, i hope this pp really continues to do what it can to help people in learning different languages."
duolingo,5,5,"what can i say... this pp got me interested in language learning, 3 years ago i could barely say ""hello nice to meet you"" in english, now i can talk with people about a lot of different subjects, although if you want to improve your listening/pronunciation skill you have to look elsewhere, i don't know, couture is a thing, be creative with it, use the internet to learn."
duolingo,5,1,"i think you should be able to pick your gender so you know how to pronounce thing with that tone of voice because there is a difference in the way things are said by male or female, it would be nice if i could practice only hearing a female voice so i can pronounce things the way a female would in that language"
duolingo,5,1,great pp!
duolingo,5,1,"i used domingo as a challenge to myself and to the pp itself by choosing, what i considered, a difficult language to learn....chinese."
duolingo,5,1,i have learnt more than i thought i would and with such ease in a short amount of time.
duolingo,5,1,"you can't not give it a go, you have literally nothing to lose."
duolingo,5,1,"if it doesn't suit you, install it and no harm done, that's my thinking either way."
duolingo,5,4,"i do love this learning pp, especially the stories!"
duolingo,5,4,love the creativity.
duolingo,5,4,i would like to be able to strengthen multiple skill at once and /or be able to test multiple skill at once.
duolingo,5,4,but that's just me using the pp as a complement to a course.
duolingo,5,4,for people learning a language from scratch this pp is highly recommended by yours truly.
duolingo,5,0,i absolutely love domingo but i think it helps me learn spanish words better than it helps me learn to speak spanish.
duolingo,5,0,speaking exercises are great but why do they only practice repeating what was heard?
duolingo,5,0,why not speak the spanish translation or situation speaking in spanish?
duolingo,5,0,"""tell the waiter you need a table for two."""
duolingo,5,0,"or do says: ""de que color es el vested de muter."""
duolingo,5,0,"learner looks at a picture and answers, ""el vested de muter es room."""
duolingo,5,0,keep up the good work domingo!
duolingo,5,4,wonderful pp!
duolingo,5,4,fun and easy to use.
duolingo,5,4,great way to get hooked on learning a new language.
duolingo,5,4,very interactive and engaging - 100% recommended!!
duolingo,5,4,"there are as, but surprisingly they're for things i'm actually interested in, and they are non-intrusion (they don't pop up during lessons, but only after a lesson has been completed)."
duolingo,5,8,"the pp was maybe 3.5-4 stars when i first started using it a few years ago, but it's definitely grown into a 5 star pp since."
duolingo,5,8,"lots of expansion to the language courses, and new features like fully voice-acted (not text-to-speech) audiobook- type stories to practice listening to conversation and conceptual listening (so far only in french, spanish, and german again)."
duolingo,5,8,very fun language learning pp that keeps you engaged and growing.
duolingo,5,2,great pp.
duolingo,5,2,"it's really helping me learn new languages easily, and any adds they show you are quick."
duolingo,5,2,"when you run out of hearts, instead of saying you must wait the 4+hours for the next one, they let you practice what you've been working on to earn a heart."
duolingo,5,2,i love this pp
duolingo,5,2,i have been using this pp for about 2 weeks now and its brilliant!
duolingo,5,2,"i've learned so many words for having just started, and i hope one day to be a fluid speaker in scottish garlic."
duolingo,5,2,"the adds only come up when after you've done a lesson and don't come out of nowhere like some other apes can, and there is a paid version that will do away with as."
duolingo,5,2,i'm considering buying the pro version as i'm enjoying the pp so much.
duolingo,5,2,5 stars all day long!
duolingo,5,5,"it is the bomb!, really good for learning nous, and clot others, this reaches clot, however i prefer learning in person from teachers, they tell how to use certain words properly, other than that, amazing pp."
duolingo,5,5,"i do advise using this as a secondary way to learn a language, this doesn't teach everything you need to know."
duolingo,5,5,it is even free!!!
duolingo,5,5,"thank u all so much domingo, you guns are amazing."
duolingo,5,5,please keep adding learning content.
duolingo,5,5,is- i'm now beginning russian.
duolingo,5,5,"please enable tips on russian, thank yale"
duolingo,5,1,"domingo is a great pp because there are so many languages to learn and you can learn more than one at a time, it also covers all the areas of the language."
duolingo,5,1,"when learning the language you do everything - by this i mean you match up words, you pick the right words/phrases, you speak words and you also type after a few lessons."
duolingo,5,1,i personally also really like the little moscow when he pips up and says something inspiration (this function is optional on settings) and the fact you have hearts.
duolingo,5,2,stories changes everything!
duolingo,5,2,i never actively seek an pp on the play store and write a review but i had to after trying the new story feature.
duolingo,5,2,"the questions were relevant, the stories were comedy and the voice acting is superb, i really felt it when maria put salt instead of sugar in her coffee."
duolingo,5,2,excellent work!
duolingo,5,1,takes a little getting used to.
duolingo,5,1,quite a complicated interface but it makes sense once you get to grip with it.
duolingo,5,1,lessons are better than roseola stone: more permission so you don't have to get every capital letter or punctuation exactly right to get an answer marked as correct
duolingo,5,1,"it is absolutely amazing, i love the fact that you can challenge other people but not be able to have any contact with them, it's kind of like a game but a learning platform."
duolingo,5,1,"it is a really good pp, the only bad thing is that you have to keep on doing the same lessons over and over again so it starts to get boring."
duolingo,5,1,i really think you should download it.
duolingo,5,1,seriously this is free it is high quality stuff.
duolingo,5,1,i'm giving this 5 stars.
duolingo,5,4,"as only appear at end of each session,are very short."
duolingo,5,4,"i am so surprised at how fast, easily i am learning languages."
duolingo,5,4,it's free!
duolingo,5,4,"i do need lots of repetition to learn but i am sick and tired of learning german ""trot, passed"" with the only fun twist being ""trot und passed."""
duolingo,5,4,"also wish that for the languages that use accents,to always show the correct written sentence; example, when it's a recording you need to write what you hear or when you need to translate,it only corrects my accents sometimes!"
duolingo,5,0,"the pp is very useful, and i enjoy using it."
duolingo,5,0,"i'm learning german, and thanks to domingo, i'm learning much faster than i do in school."
duolingo,5,0,"i wish that the hearts filled faster, but that's literally my only critique."
duolingo,5,0,"so, yeah, domingo is great, it keeps you on track with your lessons by sending modifications to your phone, and it's self paced, overall, a great pp."
duolingo,5,0,10/10 💯
duolingo,5,0,i can get by in french and am using domingo to get up to date.
duolingo,5,0,the voice recording are wonderfully clear with a speed up /slow down option.
duolingo,5,0,"i'll get myself to a higher level before paying for further option, and appreciate being given the space to make this choice further along."
duolingo,5,7,fantastic.
duolingo,5,7,i'm so happy to find something like domingo adding scots garlic.
duolingo,5,7,it's not easy to find books on it even in scotland and as a language spoken by less than 1% here it really needs something like domingo to help more people get into it.
duolingo,5,7,you will definitely learn a lot if you stick at it and the free experience is great compared to what you might be expecting.
duolingo,5,7,the lesson variation and structure will teach you to come at the language from multiple angles and pick it all up at once.
duolingo,5,1,"very well put together, makes learning accessible and intuition."
duolingo,5,1,"format allows you to learn at your own pace, whether you want a lot of material or only have time for a little bit a day."
duolingo,5,1,honestly worth getting if you want to brush up on your language skill.
duolingo,5,9,"between the pp and the webster, you've got yourself a perfectly useful way to learn languages any time and just about anywhere."
duolingo,5,9,and free?!
duolingo,5,9,yes!!!
duolingo,5,9,no catches.
duolingo,5,9,domingo is awesome because it can be used in very small chinks.
duolingo,5,9,"no long courses, or video or other long time commitment."
duolingo,5,9,you can bang out a few good lessons while on the toilet... or waiting for the bus... or in any short moment that you get throughout the day.
duolingo,5,9,the key is to stick with it and let it's game-style structure show you the way.
duolingo,5,9,i was impressed in how the pp manages to integrate so many methods and functions for becoming comfortable with a foreign language.
duolingo,5,9,you don't just read or listen or watch... you do all the forms of communication you encounter in the real world (including speaking to the pp).
duolingo,5,9,"learning with this interactive environment beats all other methods in my opinion, and i wish that domingo would take the lessons to even more advanced levels as well."
duolingo,5,9,maybe in the future?
duolingo,5,9,"thank you to the developer for a great, free tool!"
duolingo,5,0,domingo is better than expected.
duolingo,5,0,it goes slow and reinforced the words and keeps building your vocabulary.
duolingo,5,0,i like the ability to say words and it check you.
duolingo,5,0,i wish you could do more in the free version.
duolingo,5,0,it seems like you get a few wrong answers and then you have to wait.
duolingo,5,3,quick and friendly.
duolingo,5,3,"the pp lets you get into a new language rather random, but in a great speed."
duolingo,5,3,"even minor progress is noted in a fun, ratified way so your daily experience is a step forward."
duolingo,5,3,the pp reminds you every day to continue your streak and it runs well when you use it.
duolingo,5,3,"one extra plus is the sensible approach to audit support: when audit is not a good idea, you can practice with text only."
duolingo,5,3,well done!
duolingo,5,3,"great pp in grain mode, even better when you pay :)"
duolingo,5,0,first thing i want to point out is the heart system you get 5 and lose one each mistake but you can do practice mode to earn those hearts back and learn where you made a mistake you don't need to get premium for infinite hearts you won't learn if you can make 50 mistakes with no punishment.
duolingo,5,0,the best part about the lessons is each category has 5 levels progressively getting hard so you can go back at daytime to refresh yourself and the leagues make you more competitive so it's learning but a game
duolingo,5,0,"in a world where everyone who's read 3 pages from any book act as an expert and trying to monetize their ""knowledge"" ...domingo offers a lot of knowledge for free."
duolingo,5,0,the pp is well thought.
duolingo,5,0,it has few inconsistencies but the value domingo provides it outweigh any other flaws.
duolingo,5,1,i really enjoy using this pp.
duolingo,5,1,it's easy to use and the most important part is it reaches you languages in a at-your-own-pace manner.
duolingo,5,1,it makes you repeat lessons if you're not getting questions right and encourages you to study in order to earn extra points.
duolingo,5,1,earning points makes it exciting and a fun to learn.
duolingo,5,1,i recommend using this pp for beginners in a new language.
duolingo,5,1,"5 star so far, the entire tap and hear of it made me feel great, the entire idea was so rewarding to me, learning a new language (and then more simultaneously) with an up based system was my dream all along."
duolingo,5,1,"even the adds in the free version are acceptable and at a much decent rate, along with the message ""this add helps us keep learning free"" which really makes it so much more empathizable with."
duolingo,5,1,"will be back if i find any recommendations, but so far i'm much more learning from you 🥰"
duolingo,5,0,it is fun and easy to use.
duolingo,5,0,"domingo allows the learner to fault and repeat as many times as the learner needs, at the learner's pace, and it's free."
duolingo,5,0,"domingo has many more strength, but i will only highlight one, it lives up to its aim of ""making learning free and fun"""
duolingo,5,9,i've gone all the way through with german.
duolingo,5,9,it was helpful for a visit to austria.
duolingo,5,9,doubled in french.
duolingo,5,9,now i need to learn spanish for a job.
duolingo,5,9,i'm making swift progress.
duolingo,5,9,tiny cards are great for vocabulary building- just wish they accepted contractions.
duolingo,5,9,the stories are helpful for actual applications of what i've been studying.
duolingo,5,9,the first check point exam did take vocal introduced in the succeeding lesson - an obvious mistake.
duolingo,5,9,didn't hold me back.
duolingo,5,1,amazing.
duolingo,5,1,"i'm using the pp to learn japanese from english currently, and although it's definitely suited for teaching spanish, french, and german, it's still the best way to learn japanese that i've found that actually gives you the whole language for free as well as reaches you both how to speak the language and how to read it."
duolingo,5,1,most japanese learning apes i've used only do one or the other.
duolingo,5,1,as are non-intrusion and don't hinder the pp itself at all.
duolingo,5,1,i highly recommend this pp.
duolingo,5,0,love it!!
duolingo,5,0,i studied a bit of german many years ago.
duolingo,5,0,"i really enjoy the interactive way of presenting, the awards system and the comments and suggestions of users."
duolingo,5,0,i am a very busy special needs teacher and domingo is a great positive diversion off my daily routine.
duolingo,5,0,thank you
duolingo,5,1,jaw talk svenska no!
duolingo,5,1,this pp has taught me more in a few weeks than i've ever learned in school.
duolingo,5,1,the pp is easy to navigable and the design is good to look at.
duolingo,5,1,"overall, i'm incredibly impressed with domingo, if you want to learn a language in a fun, interactive way then definitely download this pp!"
duolingo,5,0,it's simple a simple enough pp.
duolingo,5,0,"there isn't pressure for how much you do in a day, you set that and can learn at your own pace."
duolingo,5,0,"i'm not far into the pp yet, but it seems good so far!"
duolingo,5,0,i live in amsterdam and i quickly picked up on dutch from living there but domingo has helped me so much with the more difficult words!
duolingo,5,0,i'm actually pretty good at dutch now.
duolingo,5,0,"it helps that this pp makes you speak sentences into the mid, also you have to write down translations."
duolingo,5,0,absolutely love it!
duolingo,5,16,easy going but ready to give your brain a good lookout.
duolingo,5,16,am using the spanish language pp.
duolingo,5,16,suits every level of student as needed.
duolingo,5,16,"very useful in conjunction with other methods, such as classes, but domingo also great when used on its own."
duolingo,5,16,highly recommended by me and by my fellow classmates.
duolingo,5,16,i find the different subjects provide variety as i progress - and the stories add interest to the lessons.
duolingo,5,16,probably the most useful and most used pp i've ever download.
duolingo,5,166,"have been using this pp daily for almost one month now, and it's been a blast."
duolingo,5,166,"download it to learn swedish for a trip and so far it's been so much fun, haven't used the voice input so far however."
duolingo,5,166,"other than that, the i is simple and easy to use, learning definitely feels like learning (unlike what it feels in school)"
duolingo,5,0,"can't be used by itself for language learning, but as a supplement it is my favorite pp."
duolingo,5,0,"extremely reliable, short infrequent as, and highly rewarding."
duolingo,5,0,some things can be frustration but that's more due to the lessons than the pp itself.
duolingo,5,0,"if you enjoy domingo, this pp is for you"
duolingo,5,0,quick easy fun lessons.
duolingo,5,0,lots of repetition and practice.

duolingo,5,5,"fairly new to this, but i'm enjoying my experience so far."
duolingo,5,5,"if there was only one complaint, although it's not really that, it's just the word i'm using, it's that they just throw larger words and pronunciation at you without warning while you're still doing the simplest pronunciation."

duolingo,5,4,and provide us with something utilitarian to do with our lights.
duolingo,5,4,"and since this pp works on a global level, it would be better if we could have a communication portal with other users to understand their language even better (i'm aware of it's sons, thus a ""block"" option would help too)."
duolingo,5,4,"all in all, i'm not here just to bladder."
duolingo,5,4,i've been using this pp for over 2 years now.
duolingo,5,4,keep it up!
duolingo,5,0,the ratification makes the learning interesting and fun.
duolingo,5,0,nodules are also split up into smaller bite sized sessions so the learning can be customised according to everyone's own pace.

duolingo,5,5,"❤️ the only missing point (in previous versions), which was user engagement, has been well handled with the help of interesting stories and tournament, making it much more fun to use the pp rather than simple lessons which become boring after some point of time."
duolingo,5,5,would be nice if domingo shows the correct answer rather than just saying 'you are correct!'
duolingo,5,5,", same as it does for a wrong answers - ''."
duolingo,5,5,it will help in enforcing the learning process.
duolingo,5,0,i adore this pp!
duolingo,5,0,"even if you don't have time, it's easy to find 5-10 minutes to practice your target language with domingo!"

duolingo,5,0,domingo is the top-of-mind and all-time favourite language learning pp!
duolingo,5,0,"i can use basic spanish with friends, write and read spanish at the level that my latin friends say i'm good at using it."

duolingo,5,0,"for this learning english using that version of the pp, there are still many language stitches in that version."
duolingo,5,0,"now, the answers are strict/narrow, especially for en to th answers; some of your answers may be correct and more prevalent in real settings."
duolingo,5,0,easy to use free knowledge it has a streak system to encourage continuous use it discourages mistakes by taking 1 of your 5 hearts away.

duolingo,5,0,i highly recommend it for the aspirin polyglot
duolingo,5,3,this pp is awesome!
duolingo,5,3,"i'm making progresses in russian, italian, and german."
duolingo,5,3,"i anna learn serbian, but that language isn't available."
duolingo,5,3,😭 pus add?
duolingo,5,3,:3 i think it would be better if you put information about words.
duolingo,5,3,"for example, in russian there are 'все' and 'всё'."
duolingo,5,3,"in order to make it easier for users, you should've added information about the difference between those two words (when to use them)."
duolingo,5,3,i'm waiting for the improvement.
duolingo,5,5,i have used domingo on and off for a few years now (usually starting up around the start of each year when i begin my resolutions!

duolingo,5,8,"that being said, do is everything that it bands itself as."
duolingo,5,8,the written learning is comprehensive.
duolingo,5,8,the audit is slightly robotic at times but definitely understandable.
duolingo,5,8,"there are even phrases that it wants you to speak, allowing practice for spoken word."

duolingo,5,1,there are few things that bother me though: 1) is there a way to add words and dictionary sections + the part with learning material for each block from your webster to the pp?
duolingo,5,1,it others a lot to keep using brother for checking how many words i know or checking the rules 2) i am getting way too many lights if use pp every day.
duolingo,5,1,nowhere to spend them anymore.
duolingo,5,1,can you add maybe extra texts or things in shop?

duolingo,5,13,i find it very helpful to red the lessons to achieve 5 crowns with increasing difficulty to help solidity what i have learned.

duolingo,5,6,i love this pp.
duolingo,5,6,i'm currently studying japanese.
duolingo,5,6,"my biggest complaint for japanese specifically is that there are lessons for hiragana, but we're kind just thrown straight into katakana and anti."
duolingo,5,6,"i used separate apes to learn katakana on my own, but it'd be nice if i didn't have to use multiple apes."
duolingo,5,6,i should also mention that some of the phrases that we learn in japanese are extremely rarely used by native speakers (according to hellotalk friends).
duolingo,5,6,"anyhow, this pp is great."
duolingo,5,6,thanks domingo!
duolingo,5,7,"i personally started to use do lingo in order to learn japanese, after it was recommended to me recently."
duolingo,5,7,"thus far it has delivered, and has been enjoyable and fun to use."
duolingo,5,7,"from its small semi-competitive leaderboards which inspire one to strive to be better in order to be the best of your division, to its simple easy to use i. if you are to learn a language i would recommend using do lingo for the reasons listed previously."

duolingo,5,0,pretty good so far!
duolingo,5,0,do a few exercises during my breaks at work and a couple at home.
duolingo,5,0,it uses advertising for the free version but they dont overwhelm you with them or force you to sit long periods to watch them.
duolingo,5,0,and their is plenty to learn
duolingo,5,0,this is one of the best language apes i've tried - i can't believe it's free!
duolingo,5,0,"for latin languages, i can say that the domingo approach to learning works for me - those languages also include tips for each lesson that explain the grammar involved in the lesson in simple terms with useful examples."
duolingo,5,0,"for languages such as polish and russian, i think some more work would need to be added before domingo could be considered a go-to approach for these languages - there are no tips for each lesson."
duolingo,5,0,"great, precise, effective, is just very easy to learn a new language with the pp."
duolingo,5,0,great pp.
duolingo,5,0,really easy too navigable and use.

duolingo,5,2,the different forms of repetition are very helpful.
duolingo,5,2,and it's all free so it's hard to complain.
duolingo,5,2,the only thing i find extra challenging is pronunciation in certain languages like garlic and iceland.
duolingo,5,2,the sounds aren't explained very much and even in supplementary online searches it's difficult to compensate for this.
duolingo,5,2,but if you already know some fundamentals or are starting an easier language than you're good to go.
duolingo,5,0,"it's a fairly fun way to learn a language, if you truly want to learn or get a better understanding, starting with this wouldn't be a bad idea"
duolingo,5,0,this pp is ideal to learn a new language.
duolingo,5,0,even if you are not a native speaker you can easily speak that language bluntly within a span of a few months.
duolingo,5,0,"recently improved, addressing many issues i had previously, my only real criticism is the frequent as."
duolingo,5,0,love it!

duolingo,5,6,"there are great lessons, podcasts, short stories in all languages to learn."
duolingo,5,6,you can also be competitive with other users.
duolingo,5,6,the only thing this pp doesn't have is the option to set chats with other users.
duolingo,5,6,i feel like that will complete this pp definitely.
duolingo,5,0,best free pp for languages.
duolingo,5,0,sure there may be restore payment option but you can easily learn the language of your choice for free and its so easy and fun!

duolingo,5,1,5/5 if you can disabled the word bank 1/5 if you cannot edit: they brought back the ability to type every answer!

duolingo,5,0,"really great pp, i have learned so much already."
duolingo,5,0,it's fun and simple to use and best of all free!
duolingo,5,8,"brilliant pp for learning languages, i've learnt a good lot of swedish and while there are faults here and there, these are quickly fixed by the de team."
duolingo,5,8,"the only major problem is that some of the less common languages don't have reverse courses, e.g there is swedish from english, but not english from swedish."
duolingo,5,8,"however, this is does not affect one's learning significantly and i'm sure the des already have their work cut out for them with all the other languages."
duolingo,5,8,definitely would recommend.
duolingo,5,0,"pp is great, i love it."
duolingo,5,0,"i know i need to be doing more to learn, but this is very practical for a busy lifestyle and a good start for beginners."

duolingo,5,4,"i've been using domingo on and off for years - i have difficulty sticking to habits, but i keep coming back to domingo because of its easy interface and intuition language building exercises."

duolingo,5,4,"thanks to domingo, i'm improving my conversational skill again."
duolingo,5,3,it's a really good pp!

duolingo,5,0,"i find this pp very encouraging, and keeps me on track, however i would dearly love to learn makarin simple language as i have more contact with chinese communities, this would help me enormously, but i'm enjoying learning italian too, thank you very very much,"
duolingo,5,0,learning a languages has never been that much fun.. learning through answering questions like a game is really an effective methodology..
duolingo,5,7,it's easy to use and intuition.
duolingo,5,7,i like the fact that you can repeat the exercises until you pass the test at the end of each section.
duolingo,5,7,the audit is mixed between male and female voices and allows to to repeat it until you get it right.
duolingo,5,7,points system is rather complicated and when you run out of points it seems to restrict what you can do.
duolingo,5,7,for example the tests can only be completed if you have enough points.
duolingo,5,7,in the end i have subscribed for the plus version to remove these limitations and the as.
duolingo,5,0,i thoroughly enjoy this game!
duolingo,5,0,i have learned a ton since using it.
duolingo,5,0,"the tips, the lessons, the stories... with real versions of people saying the phrases and words in native speaking."

duolingo,5,0,my one complaint is that the free version of domingo gives you a limited amount of mistakes before you are locked out for a time.
duolingo,5,0,"with premium, you get as many tries as you like!"

duolingo,5,1,"this pp makes learning languages easy and fun.it is also easy and convenient to pick up and use, doesn't take up much space on your device and encourages you to use it every day."

duolingo,5,7,quite honestly i wasn't sure how i was going to feel about the pp.
duolingo,5,7,"the font agitated me in the beginning, but not enough to dock a star."
duolingo,5,7,"you have to be very careful when looking at certain kann ("" i"" and ""sa"") as at first glance it may seem to be the same character so take your time."
duolingo,5,7,"other than that the lessons are fun, the heart system adds little risk to the reward, and my personal favorite piece for competitive learner's like myself, the banking system is perfect."
duolingo,5,7,i love this pp!!
duolingo,5,7,!
duolingo,5,0,"i don't think that is possible to get fleecy whit this system, but definitely helps a lot to fix grammar... it only depends on how you use it."

duolingo,5,235,"when it comes to the content itself, i thought it was very effective."
duolingo,5,235,they repeat the same questions in different ways to be very thorough and make sure you understand.
duolingo,5,235,it definitely helps when memorizing.
duolingo,5,235,"just one tip, if you have big fingers like me, and make a lot of types, make sure to re-read your answer before pressing ""check""."
duolingo,5,17,"since using domingo, my vocabulary has increased giving me the confidence to speak in public."
duolingo,5,17,"at first, i was skeptically on how domingo could help me read, write, and speak in a different language."
duolingo,5,17,"today, i happily recommend domingo as a way to obtain a new language!"
duolingo,5,17,i would also recommend the practices that accompany each lesson and the interactive stories!
duolingo,5,6,"very easy to use, i love the stories you can read in another language!"
duolingo,5,6,the pp doesn't use much data when playing without wife and the variety of question types helps you to learn all aspects of the language.

duolingo,5,2,it's a great pp and i have learnt a lot of french from this pp.
duolingo,5,2,"i recommend this pp to everyone, and even young children can use this."
duolingo,5,2,using this pp is very easy and the exercises are great to improve language skill.

duolingo,5,2,"overall, this is a wonderful pp and i have been using it for a long time."
duolingo,5,0,"very nice language learning pp that uses your reading, listening and speaking abilities to teach, wholeheartedly recommend"

duolingo,5,0,it is a helpful pp.
duolingo,5,0,"a cut style, quality gameplay."
duolingo,5,0,there are many languages.
duolingo,5,6,thoroughly enjoyable.
duolingo,5,6,the integrated learning approach is new to me and i find it works better than the traditional system of learning verb declensions and lists of vocabulary.
duolingo,5,6,i adore the little owl with his or her positive reinforcement.
duolingo,5,6,"by practicing little and often, i now find myself on day 307. it has just whizzed by."
duolingo,5,6,i almost enjoy making mistakes because the method of the same phrase appearing repeatedly until you get it right means you are forced to understand how it works.
duolingo,5,0,only a few days in.
duolingo,5,0,"great motivation for small lessons, really turns it into a game you feel you're winning, and you don't want to lose your 'streak'."
duolingo,5,0,"minimal invasion reminders, usually once a day with a second reminder in the evening if you didn't complete the lesson."

duolingo,5,268,🥂
duolingo,5,10,great pp to learn a language.
duolingo,5,10,"there is a premium subscription, but i never really felt like i *had* to get it."
duolingo,5,10,"there are advertisements, but they aren't intrusion at all and the pp doesn't bombard you with them."
duolingo,5,10,"i also like the streak system, every day you complete a lesson, your streak increases, so you have an incentive to learn every day (if such a thing works on you)."
duolingo,5,11,very good pp.
duolingo,5,11,this pp allows for a lot of practice of the language which has helped me to better understand the principles and to work towards mastery of a foreign language (french in my case).
duolingo,5,11,there is however room for improvement in my opinion.
duolingo,5,11,the addition of oral exercises which would allow the learner to practise speaking as well as the inclusion of comprehension passages would be useful.
duolingo,5,0,"superb pp, great fun to use and i really feel like i'm achieving something."
duolingo,5,0,it's a wee bit adjective.
duolingo,5,1,its great.
duolingo,5,1,fantastic there is no flaw or at least none that i have found yet i love it.
duolingo,5,1,although just one tiny thing maybe if the pictures were removed then it might be harder to figure out what what because whenever its a find out what this word is question it always shows photo to make it obvious but other then that its great
duolingo,5,0,very good pp.
duolingo,5,0,makes learning into a game and less of a chose.
duolingo,5,123,this is absolutely amazing.

duolingo,5,123,thank you!
duolingo,5,123,i love the pp.
duolingo,5,96,"this pp is perfect, just what i was looking for."
duolingo,5,96,"the as are well controlled too which is great for a free pp, you can learn more than one language at a time."
duolingo,5,96,"it's simple to navigable, quick to set up."
duolingo,5,96,"you can compete with friends, there is a top 50 leader board which is set up so it's a random 50 people and not the universal top 50. this makes competing more fun and achieveable."
duolingo,5,96,having 5 lives keeps you concentrating.
duolingo,5,96,the awards are fun.
duolingo,5,96,only bad thing is not all languages test speaking skill
duolingo,5,5,an absolutely phenomena educational application.
duolingo,5,5,"while many sites and courses build their content on technical levels, with everything being taught as machine-like and algorithmic, domingo is a breath of fresh air that truly attempts to imbibe fleecy in its users."
duolingo,5,5,"it's the difference between translating ""je suis content(e)"" to ""i am happy"" and understanding ""je suis content(e)"" as ""je suis content""."
duolingo,5,5,"to any one searching for an aid to learning language, with ample practice, do is the way."
duolingo,5,3,the best way to learn a new language that i've ever tried!
duolingo,5,3,"i am not good at learning languages, but i actually find myself remembering the lessons from domingo whereas i never could remember anything using other methods."
duolingo,5,3,"my only complaint is that for spanish it can't understand me when i say ""no, do, tres"" even though i'm pronouncing it correctly - i've had my boyfriend whose first language is spanish try and it can't understand him either; it's just a pitch."
duolingo,5,3,overall love it though!
duolingo,5,3,engaging and fun way to learn.
duolingo,5,3,i am english speaking and use for learning french.
duolingo,5,3,"good variety of learning technique: listening, repeating back, fill in the blank, translating english to french and french to english, tying and speaking with microphone."
duolingo,5,3,able to turn off microphone for one hour if unable to speak that moment or turn off listening if unable to use audit at that time.
duolingo,5,3,very thoughtful technique and tips for learning.
duolingo,5,3,useful phrases/sentences.
duolingo,5,3,definitely 5 star language pp.
duolingo,5,2,"it's so admitting, interactive and fun!"
duolingo,5,2,"and i don't have to sit and wait to keep going if i loose my heart saves, i can just go back and review to gain more myself witch is super helpful and good practice!"
duolingo,5,2,"i would love to see if they can somehow get american sign language as well, this pp and how it's set up would be awesome!"
duolingo,5,3,how is this pp free?
duolingo,5,3,it's soon good!
duolingo,5,3,"just the free version, on its own, is top notch!"
duolingo,5,3,i used this pp a couple of years ago and started using it again few months back.
duolingo,5,3,the quality has only gone up.
duolingo,5,3,"when the leaderboard feature rolled in, at first i didn't like it."
duolingo,5,3,"but now, i log on to the pp everyday and finish my lessons, just to advance to the next league."
duolingo,5,3,everything in the pp is so user friendly.
duolingo,5,3,"the feedback and reminders, not to the mention the weekly reports, are very helpful"
duolingo,5,2,"my kiss love domingo, they learn clot and the as are very short and there are very few, and also the adds dont just random pop up."
duolingo,5,2,"you can watch as to regain extra hearts, double gems and least one other thing, but they are optional."
duolingo,5,2,"domingo is best used for my kiss by headphones, but they learn clot."
duolingo,5,2,and are very good at their languages for school.
duolingo,5,2,you can learn any language even if you want to learn english!
duolingo,5,2,you can create a surname.
duolingo,5,2,"if you play an online game, use your surname easy"
duolingo,5,14,learning made fun!
duolingo,5,14,i've been using this pp about two weeks.
duolingo,5,14,i've learned so many words and refreshed the ones i already knew.
duolingo,5,14,it's a travel agents must have for learning.
duolingo,5,14,i enjoy the stories for extra credit.
duolingo,5,14,"be sure to log into web page for content that's not on the pp, like stories, dictionary, learned words."
duolingo,5,14,it's the first pp i open in the morning and the last before bed.
duolingo,5,14,i m paying the $10 for unlimited use.
duolingo,5,14,best investment for my mind all year.
duolingo,5,14,"gracious domingo,"
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp because along with my spanish courses at school, it helps to keep my education going outside of class."
duolingo,5,0,i also love how it looks.
duolingo,5,0,the way apes look are vital to engaging me in apes.
duolingo,5,0,i also love the stories they've added recently.
duolingo,5,0,domingo is very positive learning and i love it.
duolingo,5,6,domingo has been a great learning experience for me.
duolingo,5,6,"the i looks great , the as aren't terrible, the community is very positive, and progression to a next level feels earned."
duolingo,5,6,"my two criticisms are that i saw no way to have crowd source lessons made available in pp (which would be useful for specialized fields of work) and that ""on the surface"" community interaction in the pp is very limited; having the ability to send ""drops"" to others in your same banking tier would improve this."
duolingo,5,9,i've had a lot of fun with domingo!
duolingo,5,9,i like the little owl's encouraging messages and the reminders to practice aren't too invasion or insistent.
duolingo,5,9,it sounds work but this is honestly the first time in my life where i don't mind being advertised to because i get to choose if i want to see some of them and get gems and hearts to practice more as a reward.
duolingo,5,9,"i love how it gets you used to twitching quickly between english and spanish, both written, spoken, and usually understanding."
duolingo,5,0,the best language learning application i have ever used.
duolingo,5,0,it's free and the material is fantastically done to help you learn fast and remember.
duolingo,5,0,it has a huge list of languages.
duolingo,5,0,there is one ad at the end of each lesson.
duolingo,5,0,so they dont bug you every second.
duolingo,5,0,definitely worth more than 5 stars.
duolingo,5,0,"a amazing pp for language learning,easy to use and free!there are some as, obviously,but you can buy a ""paid version"" to remove those as;despite that, it's a fantastic pp,i would recommend it for anyone who is interested in learn a language."
duolingo,5,0,i love domingo!
duolingo,5,0,i especially like two aspects of learning with domingo.
duolingo,5,0,"first, the program structure allows for several repetition of a new material and that helps in memorizing."
duolingo,5,0,the second aspect is a concept of leagues where one can view a progress and compare that progress with others in the same league.
duolingo,5,6,this is definitely the best pp for learning the spanish language.
duolingo,5,6,i have tried many and domingo is the most complete and comprehensive language learning tool i have experienced.
duolingo,5,6,"yes, at times it seems boring and repetition but unfortunately that is how you learn."
duolingo,5,6,the further you go the easier it gets and also do opens more ways to study as you progress.
duolingo,5,6,i highly recommend do for anyone who wishes to learn any language.
duolingo,5,4,the perfect pp for learning and practicing written and reading skill in other languages.
duolingo,5,4,"the user interface is excellent and intuition, with friendly reminders to practice."
duolingo,5,4,i think the pp and the domingo system has been done very well and i would consider going pro if i were more disciplined about practicing!
duolingo,5,4,"highly recommended, i have done some lessons in a few languages and it is very consistent."
duolingo,5,0,an intelligent and fun way to learn supported by tips and others' useful comments and information aids.
duolingo,5,0,love it!
duolingo,5,0,very pleased this far.
duolingo,5,0,a little discouraging when you it asks you to take a quit and only 10% of the words on the quit are ones you have learned in the lessons.?.
duolingo,5,0,?
duolingo,5,0,love this pp very educational and clear.
duolingo,5,0,easy to learn.
duolingo,5,0,i have learned a lot and i will keep learning.
duolingo,5,0,great pp for states....it easily teach you an english language in the flow that you really enjoy it.
duolingo,5,0,"easy to use, and, a great sequence and combination of communication phrases both verbal and written"

duolingo,5,0,no complaints and will spread the word for others to learn.
duolingo,5,0,i'm having fun learning a second language.
duolingo,5,0,real easy to use and has leaderboards to make the learning experience competitive.

duolingo,5,6,"it is very easy to use, the lessons are easily understandable, the instructions are clear, and the leaderboards make it a fun yet competitive way to learn a language."
duolingo,5,6,"the only grip i have is the lack of a dark mode, since i use this pp a lot during night time and it blinds my eyes."
duolingo,5,6,"other than that, the i itself is also fantastic and easy to navigable."
duolingo,5,6,i would absolutely recommend this pp to anyone seeking to learn a language.
duolingo,5,3,"this pp has all the learning/ teaching technique, so it's perfect for all earners."
duolingo,5,3,it also repeats itself so you don't lose what you've already learned while maintaining the challenge.
duolingo,5,3,"the only suggestion i have, so far, is to incorporate the macedonian language."
duolingo,5,3,there are not many apes available who fully support this language( for ex: there are words but no voice)
duolingo,5,5,its a great product for forming a habit of studying language every day.
duolingo,5,5,its fun and interactive.
duolingo,5,5,"it shouldn't be your primary source of language learning if you want to actually learn a language, but it is definitely a great resource."
duolingo,5,5,the podcast linked to it is a little too liberal in its stories for my taste but still a good resource.
duolingo,5,0,"amazing pp, but i dont know if i am just insane but i closed the insane option where it said 50 up a day and i did 1100. it will be awesome if you added more please"
duolingo,5,0,"this is best pp for learning languages, it is easy and so fun to learn, i love it"

duolingo,5,5,"last year i tried learning japanese with babel (i think) but the just threw words at me, not understanding how the alphabet worked, unlike this which is doing quite a good job of it."
duolingo,5,5,"i do have one problem though, when faced with the puzzle to choose which sounds fit with each letter, pressing the hiragana letter first causes the sound to be played, which i hope will stop after a while or if there is a setting to turn off."
duolingo,5,2,i'm learning a lot of vocabulary and verb conjugations.
duolingo,5,2,the practice sections are really helpful to review your learning.
duolingo,5,2,the discussions explain the why if you get it wrong so you can make sense of the irregulars.
duolingo,5,2,i wish there could be some back and forth dialogue.
duolingo,5,2,it's fun and easy.
duolingo,5,2,"i'm really enjoying my ""do"" time!"
duolingo,5,3,"hi, i love this pp so much."

duolingo,5,0,"even when i stopped for over a year, i hadn't forgotten what i learned."
duolingo,5,0,"domingo uses the same method as the very expensive roseola stone computer software (immersion), and they do it for free."
duolingo,5,0,absolutely 5 stars.
duolingo,5,0,"a totally enjoyable, fast-moving and engaging way to learn a language!"
duolingo,5,255,this is the best pp to learn a new language!
duolingo,5,255,"you don't need to pay for any lesson, the application is simple and easy to navigable."
duolingo,5,255,"i have considered buying the plus version, the exercises and office lessons are great, but honestly, not too much appealing."
duolingo,5,255,"i think if the application had some grammar, tips or explanations (""ok, you need to speak like this, and the reason is that"") the plus version would be more interesting."
duolingo,5,255,"it could be a real plus, but the pp is already awesome."
duolingo,5,0,i'm really enjoying learning a new language!
duolingo,5,0,it's fun interactive method makes learning new words & phrases a breeze.this language pp us great!
duolingo,5,0,extraordinary.

duolingo,5,0,now coming to the third idiot!
duolingo,5,0,"it's the best pp out there for learning languages, but it may not be tailor to your learning style."
duolingo,5,0,"domingo makes learning a new language fun, and easy!"
duolingo,5,0,"adding friends and the leaderboards can make for a fun competition, motivation to continue learning."
duolingo,5,0,"for free learning experience that can be tailor to your daily schedule, this is an amazing pp."
duolingo,5,12,"domingo is a very intuition, user friendly and fun to use."
duolingo,5,12,i have never got such an experience from a language learning application before.
duolingo,5,12,all fall short when compared to that unique fun and game experience it brings to the table.
duolingo,5,12,i have been using it for something like over a week and overall i still am amazed at how it makes me want to learn new things each day sometimes multiple times a day.
duolingo,5,12,"good number of languages available, for now i have been going for german, spanish and chinese."
duolingo,5,0,"an easy and productive way to learn, practice and experience languages."
duolingo,5,0,best of all it's free.
duolingo,5,1,very good addition to your language learning routine!
duolingo,5,1,the creator really do seem devoted to making language learning both free and fun.
duolingo,5,1,the community conversations help for tricky words and phrases.
duolingo,5,1,the only issue i've found is words not being fully defined and multiple meanings not always being explained.
duolingo,5,1,but this pp is better than the class i took in school and many language learning courses i've played for.
duolingo,5,1,very very good- especially for free!
duolingo,5,0,this pp is perfect if you want to learn a language for free.
duolingo,5,0,it makes us practice skill thoroughly in a fun way.
duolingo,5,0,i personally am a non-plus user but actually i don't really mind all the as since they're not video.
duolingo,5,0,"i think that the hearts system is actually pretty beneficial for users since along with making us practice skill, it also makes us know which skill we need more practice for."
duolingo,5,0,i love the domingo stories since they're pretty interesting and help us learn new words.
duolingo,5,0,great pp.
duolingo,5,4,the pp is great so far.
duolingo,5,4,"my only issue is that at some point you are forced to purchase the paid version for a ""free"" trial period."
duolingo,5,4,"if it is free, why do you need my credit card?"
duolingo,5,4,then automatically charge me if i don't cancel.
duolingo,5,4,not free.
duolingo,5,4,"now using the pp for a month, l think its great!"
duolingo,5,4,we are really learning french.
duolingo,5,0,it works well enough but the social aspect really enhanced my learning.
duolingo,5,0,mainly for basic level italian revision: i haven't tried learning from scratch.
duolingo,5,3,i love domingo!
duolingo,5,3,"it's repetition without being boring, and clearly explains why when i get an answer wrong."
duolingo,5,3,"it makes learning fun, it's my new favorite game!"
duolingo,5,3,adds are well placed and not disruption in the middle of a lesson.
duolingo,5,3,"can be used by anyone who can read, i would recommend domingo to anyone wanting to learn a new language"
duolingo,5,0,it's exceeded my expectations.
duolingo,5,0,"i thought it was going to be a bit picked mouse, after all, it's free."
duolingo,5,0,it is very thorough and has an intuition structure.
duolingo,5,0,i certainly do enjoy the daily lessons and am progressing well.
duolingo,5,0,the silly green creature giving the same repeated words of encouragement is the only irritation.
duolingo,5,1,"the pp serves its purpose, you decide if you want to see an ad in exchange of extra life's or points, you can also temporarily disabled speaking exercises if you are in public, so great for all circumstances."
duolingo,5,1,"i haven't tried the premium mode, but i imagine is even more convenient, but it's a little bit expensive."
duolingo,5,2,great pp for learning a new language.
duolingo,5,2,the lessons are fairly easy.
duolingo,5,2,if you hover a word it shows all the possible and most probable words it is.
duolingo,5,2,only issue i have is since it went premium the as for domingo upgrade are very numerous and annoying.
duolingo,5,2,in tired of everything i use or consume for free always trying to get me to upgrade.
duolingo,5,2,if i had the money id gladly buy it and the constant reminder that i can afford it kind of keeps me away.
duolingo,5,0,i download this again after you added scots garlic to your list.
duolingo,5,0,i'm learning it through upon and using domingo in between is helpful.
duolingo,5,0,"there are some bits that are podgy, you have three different dialect which could be confusing for beginners who are looking for consistency."
duolingo,5,0,and some of the grammar seems a little podgy.
duolingo,5,0,"but overall i think it's great, well worth it as a companion pp to other learning."
duolingo,5,3,"honestly, your progress is determined by the amount of effort you dedicate to your goal(s)."
duolingo,5,3,this application provides you with an amazing tools for bluntly speaking another language.
duolingo,5,3,flexible and functional this application contains everything you need to tackle any language spoken today.
duolingo,5,3,5+ stars aren't adequate in my appreciation of the developer.
duolingo,5,3,much gracious 
duolingo,5,291,i really like the fact that domingo in general has improved.
duolingo,5,291,"they now have stories to practice reading, it's good for building vocabulary, the system they have makes it fun."
duolingo,5,291,"(keeping streaks, setting your daily challenge) overall, i find it a good tool to help learn a language, not entirely sure whether it can teach the language completely but at the very least, it is a very good stepping stool."
duolingo,5,30,"it's a great, user-friendly pp with a variety of different languages for people of all skill level."
duolingo,5,30,"the new competitive feature really makes it more fun to learn by competing with local users and banking up in different leagues (bronze, silver, etc.)"
duolingo,5,30,"the pp is completely free, however there are occasional as that last a couple seconds to keep it free."
duolingo,5,30,you can pay for the upgrade version which includes all lessons even when office and is ad-free.
duolingo,5,0,"this is the best pp that i ever had used, they develop a plan to keep student focused everyday and keep showing popes everyday to remember you to do you lessons, i had used another apes but none of then are good as domingo."
duolingo,5,0,"(this english that i'm writing right now, some of it i've learned with domingo, it helps me a lot to learn languages, i'm learning japanese now and is helping me a lot too, it's a complete course which gives you the best way to start learning a language.)"
duolingo,5,0,the way the courses are set up - encouraging lots of repetition without getting boring - is ideal for learning languages mio.
duolingo,5,0,i've gone from 0 spanish to feeling confident in conversation in only 3.5 months.
duolingo,5,0,the customer service people were amazingly responsive and helpful when i was having trouble dating office courses on domingo plus.
duolingo,5,0,amazing pp that helps learn languages for free.
duolingo,5,0,only problem is when u r using it for free you see the as interfering.
duolingo,5,0,"i can't believe this pp, this is free(like literally), very very easy to go with and this is some high quality stuff.."
duolingo,5,0,"it is great, i hope they can office for people who don't usually have wife or internet."
duolingo,5,0,awesome way to learn a language.
duolingo,5,0,i just they had more things to buy in the store with the gems u earn.
duolingo,5,0,it is simple to use and short lessons allow you to study for a short time or for a longer duration on any given day.
duolingo,5,0,the structure of the profession encourages a user to keep coming back to study.
duolingo,5,0,absolutely fantastic.
duolingo,5,0,i've tried a dozen other apes but none teach you as well or as fast as this one!
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp i can learn many languages and its a fun way to study and memories and the best part is that you can test your skill
duolingo,5,0,"really awesome i, easy to use, nice reminders and good content."
duolingo,5,0,great learning pp.
duolingo,5,0,you can learn a new language easily and quick - great if you're going on vacation in another country.
duolingo,5,0,"however, sometimes when i complete my daily challenge and login the next day it says that i haven't played yesterday and it uses up my streak freeze."
duolingo,5,0,"please fix this, it's draining my lights."
duolingo,5,6,now!
duolingo,5,6,really good and the voice recognition that was a problem for me was quickly rectified.
duolingo,5,6,domingo has been absolutely great since!
duolingo,5,6,thank you.
duolingo,5,6,it has been well thought through and planned.
duolingo,5,6,it is also a great motivation.
duolingo,5,6,"very, exceptionally good."
duolingo,5,6,"🤗 i have recommended domingo spanish and italian to, respectively two further people."
duolingo,5,6,thank you!
duolingo,5,6,i couldn't have progressed with my learning french without domingo 👍
duolingo,5,111,i really enjoy the challenge of staying on a leader board.
duolingo,5,111,i've managed to stay on ruby for three weeks now.
duolingo,5,111,i love the fact that new more advanced lessons keep on being added and also the stories.
duolingo,5,111,i've recommended domingo to lots of my friends.
duolingo,5,111,i've managed to maintain a 735 day streak ( with a little help from the occasional use of streak freeze!)
duolingo,5,111,"just keep doing what you're doing, it's amazing so, much gracious, merci, graze etc!"
duolingo,5,111,further to my previous review i'm now 882 day streak!
duolingo,5,15,the fattest and easiest way to learn a new language!
duolingo,5,15,the progress report gives just enough incentive to make sure i log in every day to complete a couple lessons.
duolingo,5,15,"the only problem i have, is that the competitive banking are so large, it's a list cause to try."
duolingo,5,15,"five days into the week, i have 150 or so up."
duolingo,5,15,i'm in with.
duolingo,5,15,second and third sit at about 350 up.
duolingo,5,15,first has 1500. so placing high is pretty difficult.
duolingo,5,15,even placing high enough to advance to the fourth bracket is pretty involved.
duolingo,5,0,really great for beginning language speakers.
duolingo,5,0,"easy, fun and over all pretty great."
duolingo,5,0,i have tried several language learning apes and i like this by far the best.
duolingo,5,0,learning is actually fun.
duolingo,5,0,thank you for creating such a great pp.
duolingo,5,7,"update, pp was repaired, seems it was a problem for a lot of people."
duolingo,5,7,thank you to the developer.
duolingo,5,7,"pp didn't advance to obsidian league, still stuck in pearl league after finishing #1. this is not cool, it takes a lot of time to advance."
duolingo,5,7,it would be nice if developer or goose would contact me about this.
duolingo,5,7,i have sent messages to them before about problems.
duolingo,5,7,i guess they do not care because the pp is free.
duolingo,5,134,this pp is awesome.
duolingo,5,134,"the as don't get in the way, you can comfortably play music in the background and it's not too disruption of that, everything functions well and works fast and it is incredibly adjective."
duolingo,5,134,i can't put this down.
duolingo,5,134,my only two criticisms are that they don't tell you that you can tap on the english word to see the anti (for japanese) and that i wish they had anti/hiragana charts with stroke order you could download so you could practice writing them out.
duolingo,5,2,while some bellyache about privacy issues by being listed on a leaderboard or having to pay for a supposed 'free' pp is because they dont think.
duolingo,5,2,you dont have to use a real name (mine is scuttlebutt) and you dont have to pay to get more hearts.
duolingo,5,2,just review earlier completed lessons to earn more tries.
duolingo,5,2,"you can also ""cheat"" if you want to call it that by using other sources to help you with answers."
duolingo,5,2,its not a closed book test afterall.
duolingo,5,0,love this ...i've learned so much from the webster!
duolingo,5,0,i'm just getting the pp again....but i did like the pp before
duolingo,5,7,i am very pleased with my years of experience with domingo.
duolingo,5,7,it has helped me tremendous in my language studies.
duolingo,5,7,i recommend this to any language learner or language adduct like me.
duolingo,5,7,"though, as someone who sometimes stays up late at night studying, i would love the option to have a dark ambled theme."
duolingo,5,7,"i am greatly appreciative of the staff at domingo, and would like to thank them as they strive to make language learning fun and stress free."
duolingo,5,0,"it's really effective and efficient, the pp takes time to make sure you grasp concepts,spelling , pronunciation and accent of whatever language you decide to learn."
duolingo,5,0,using the hearts to learn is a little disadvantaging when they run out but basically it's an impressive pp.
duolingo,5,0,this is hands down one of the best ways i have discovered to learn new languages.
duolingo,5,0,i bought the one year plan so that i don't have to deal with tedious as but honesty i think it's worth the price for bordering free quality education.
duolingo,5,0,i highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn new languages.
duolingo,5,0,i enjoy the pp because it is easy to learn from it.
duolingo,5,0,if you miss something it will go back over it.
duolingo,5,0,i am really enjoying it so far.
duolingo,5,0,easy to use for every age range.
duolingo,5,0,i was a bit disappointed with the costumes for do.
duolingo,5,0,"i expected the character to be wearing it all the time through the pp, not just when it peeped in during lessons."
duolingo,5,0,is there a way to show do in their costumes when the pp loads and when lessons load?
duolingo,5,0,otherwise i feel it was a waste of gems to purchase them.
duolingo,5,0,p.s.
duolingo,5,0,"your ""hey goose"" ad is obnoxious loud with the bearing trumpet."
duolingo,5,0,please find a way to turn down the volume on it.
duolingo,5,1,great way to learn a foreign language!!!!
duolingo,5,1,it's fun and interactive.
duolingo,5,1,"you earn points, crowns and can compete against others in leagues."
duolingo,5,1,the more you learn the more additional features appear so that you are not just memorizing words and phrases but actually able to speak and understand in that chosen language!
duolingo,5,0,domingo is an amazing pp for learning languages.
duolingo,5,0,i am using domingo for almost two years.
duolingo,5,0,now i am learning organ.
duolingo,5,0,from the beginning i could write organ words myself but from the first checkpoint it stopped working.
duolingo,5,0,so i would be really grateful if it was back because it helped me to remember words.
duolingo,5,0,"when i am picking the words, i can just remember some letters from it."
duolingo,5,0,"good, interactive, could use ability to go back and correct mistakes."
duolingo,5,0,fun & easy way to learn a new language.
duolingo,5,0,wasn't very long before i could understand what they were saying to me.
duolingo,5,0,i work on it almost daily.
duolingo,5,0,"i really do like this pp, it really helps to develop your accent in many languages and correct all your grammar mistakes 💞"
duolingo,5,1,there are few apes that i'll take the time to rate.
duolingo,5,1,this is one.
duolingo,5,1,awesome.
duolingo,5,1,i took spanish in high school.
duolingo,5,1,but i feel like i have a better grasp on it now (after a few weeks) than an after entire smelter at school.
duolingo,5,1,my only suggestion is that there be a little bit more emphasis on grammar at the beginning (subject-verb agreement and etc).
duolingo,5,1,i think that part comes later on in the lessons.
duolingo,5,1,besides that 9/10 for me.
duolingo,5,2,this pp is amazing.
duolingo,5,2,"domingo reaches you hundreds of words in the span of even a day, depending on how active you are."
duolingo,5,2,"it contains motivation messages and a cut little owl, if that's what the bird is."
duolingo,5,2,"it contains as, but not video as."
duolingo,5,2,"it is totally free and you can earn lights to upgrade the pp or the languages, such as adding a whole new subject to the language, like flirtatious phrases and words."
duolingo,5,2,"it would be better if it was able to be used when you're office, but i understand."
duolingo,5,2,💚
duolingo,5,1,i really like the pp but didn't know where to give feedback.
duolingo,5,1,i would like to let you know that i love love love the stories that you added.
duolingo,5,1,such a fun way and i feel like i really understand the language since i can understand an actual conversation.
duolingo,5,1,thank you so much!!!
duolingo,5,1,"(i don't normally leave reviews, this is in fact my first on here, but i really want to let you know how fabulous this is!"
duolingo,5,1,so i hope you guns actually read this)
duolingo,5,12,"it keeps you engaged, learning a new language is about repetition, at first it will seem slow, but after a while it will start throwing some curve balls at you, like similar sounding or written words; it has a nice pacing system and the community gets to chip in with comments on the lessons you are taking."
duolingo,5,12,"you are both learning how to speak the language and it's grammar and structure, i recommend you give it a go."
duolingo,5,2,this is an extremely helpful pp and all the lessons you automatically get actually teach you the language.
duolingo,5,2,it's super easy to follow along.
duolingo,5,2,and it's really fun competing against everyone!
duolingo,5,2,"i do not recommend using gems to buy their extra lessons the, because their extra lessons dont actually teach the new words to you."
duolingo,5,2,they just have you unscrambling sentences and throw a ton of words at you.
duolingo,5,2,"its unlike the rest of the game, because the rest of the game actually tries teaching you the language."
duolingo,5,23,i really like this pp.
duolingo,5,23,"it's helping me walk through languages that i've been wanting to learn, like german, french, and russian."
duolingo,5,23,"but there are some bags were i'm not getting my achievements, and i don't like the heart system to where if i get one wrong i lose a heart, and after i lose all of them, i have to wait 4 hours to keep learning."
duolingo,5,23,i really preferred the last update where the hearts weren't there and that i could continue learning without having to wait a certain amount of time.
duolingo,5,0,incredibly fast learning and fun.
duolingo,5,0,wanted to be able to speak spanish with neighbors and friends.
duolingo,5,0,"this pp is in small segments that are quick, progress logical, throw in some grammar and provide interesting repetition."
duolingo,5,0,i absolutely love this pp and have been encouraging many others to use it.
duolingo,5,506,"it's a wonderful pp, lets you go at your own pace, lessons are replayable so you can go back any time with unlimited replayability, it's responsible programme so it seems to remember what you are getting wrong repeatedly and focused more on those lessons until you get it right, reaches great vocabulary and light grammar, based on how far you want to go you can learn how to properly communicate, or just learn the basis and go with that."
duolingo,5,506,"it's amazing, 5/5 definitely, it's a great piece of work."
duolingo,5,1,i hate the as after every lesson.
duolingo,5,1,"i don't like that grammar isn't particularly taught, just suddenly introduced in a lesson for practice."
duolingo,5,1,"i have 70000+up in spanish, and 4000+ in french, yet i hated this pp more that i liked it."
duolingo,5,1,"just my fondness for languages, and it being free (i'm frugal) kept bringing me back."
duolingo,5,1,"but i just did my first story today, and absolutely loved it."
duolingo,5,1,loved it!
duolingo,5,1,i think i can endure the as now.
duolingo,5,1,good work team!
duolingo,5,1,the best experience that i've had in learning something!!!!
duolingo,5,1,do thought of everything and it's so fun and interesting!!!
duolingo,5,1,"i would definitely recommend this pp for every one who are thinking that to learn new language is hard, because it's easier when it's built like a game."
duolingo,5,0,i found using domingo very fun and enjoyable.
duolingo,5,0,it reaches you in a way that you can understand and follow easily.
duolingo,5,0,this might be the best pp i have ever have the pleasure to use in terms of up.
duolingo,5,0,the as don't feel intrusion or annoying and following the courses feel effortless.
duolingo,5,0,"i don't really understand the chest/betting system but the rest of the ""ratification"" elements feels fun and engaging."
duolingo,5,0,easy to play and retain what you learn in a natural and interactive format.
duolingo,5,0,this is an excellent application that helps you learn your desired language in a fun and interactive way that's free.
duolingo,5,0,fun and easy to use.
duolingo,5,0,much more effective than using a physical language book.
duolingo,5,1,"easy to use, fast learning, competitive motivation, simply perfect"
duolingo,5,0,"pretty good, still have some mistakes in pronunciation of some word, but not that much"
duolingo,5,0,"amazing pp ,helps clot."
duolingo,5,0,good for entry level for learning languages.
duolingo,5,1,its a great pp and i love that its free and comes with a listen along podcast (at least for french and spanish language) one thing that would be helpful if provided by the creator would be a list of reading material appropriate for the level of learning the user is at.
duolingo,5,1,in not necessarily saying they should give books out just suggest easy to read books in the language the learner is desiring to learn.
duolingo,5,198,"a wonderful pp for language learning, very structures and formatted, so as to teach you in a methodical and simple way, if you get it wrong, it helps you and repeats."
duolingo,5,198,"each section is quite short, so it does not become boring, so you can return to any point, as and when you want!"
duolingo,5,198,"i am learning german, whilst my wife is learning french and spanish together."
duolingo,5,198,"my preference is to use it on my lawton or tablet, as it is easier to manoeuvre around, but of course you can use it on your phone."
duolingo,5,0,"really nice pp, very advanced learning system."
duolingo,5,0,would enjoy seeing more achievements or game like features in the future
duolingo,5,34,a fun way to learn a language!
duolingo,5,34,"i have used domingo on and off for years (mostly the desktop version), but i recently redownloaded the pp, and i have been really enjoying it!"
duolingo,5,34,"i like the encouraging messages, and yes, even the in-pp tones."
duolingo,5,34,they help keep it interesting and engaging.
duolingo,5,34,i am also really pleased with how they do as.
duolingo,5,34,"i have yet to see any kind of video or animated as; they are always stills, and within the pp (they don't block out your whole screen when they come on)."
duolingo,5,0,"its free, only 1 ad every level, clot of option for languages, and its very fun!"
duolingo,5,3,i love this pp for a few reasons.
duolingo,5,3,its simple to wander through and very flexible.
duolingo,5,3,it's also fun to interact with because of it's platforms.
duolingo,5,3,"speaking, writing, interpreting from english to spanish or spanish to english, it all makes learning fun and quick and the pp gives us goals to set as well so it's like having a personal tutor at the tip of my fingers!"
duolingo,5,3,love it!
duolingo,5,2,this webster helped me keep an a in my language classes end after i finish my glasses i was able to get even better at the same witches and even learn more.
duolingo,5,2,i'm so glad that japanese is added i've been wanting to learn that language for a long time.
duolingo,5,2,i would definitely recommend this to any students and people who just simply want to learn another language.
duolingo,5,1,"excellent free language pp- i am having great results making use of tips and explanations available with each lesson, and following suggestions offered (eg."
duolingo,5,1,"using headphones to hear the language, writing out sentences at the end of lessons)."
duolingo,5,1,adore the story lessons.
duolingo,5,1,"have used do as the base to grow my language learning around, and i use it almost daily, happily."
duolingo,5,0,"fun, simple, the pace is good, and i like the encouragement from the cut little.owl..."
duolingo,5,0,"a fun pp that keeps dating and developing new ways to learn and , a great community"
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is a user-friendly, easy way to learn new languages!"
duolingo,5,0,i am so impressed by this pp and love using it for just a few minutes everyday to learn!
duolingo,5,5,had one complaint about settings and i'm pretty sure it wasn't fixed but i found a way around the problem.
duolingo,5,5,although every once in a while the pronunciation is a little off.
duolingo,5,5,spanish is my gas first language and we have laughed pretty hard a couple times at the way the computer reads a word and it occasional makes me wrong on a listening exercise cut it's not saying what it wants me to hear.
duolingo,5,5,but its rare.
duolingo,5,5,not enough to disrupt my lessons.
duolingo,5,5,i give you 5 stars for bringing the world closer together.
duolingo,5,3,"excellent pp, for me it's been useful for helping me learn spanish."
duolingo,5,3,i now can (partially) understand a wide range of new music and writings.
duolingo,5,3,the addition of story is also a great feature because it lets you put your new language skill to use right in the pp.
duolingo,5,3,no doubt it took some hard work from the domingo team.
duolingo,5,0,awesome learning pp.
duolingo,5,0,"the in-pp discussions are very helpful, and the leader boards are fun."
duolingo,5,0,great fun!
duolingo,5,0,it's highly adjective... and slightly competitive!
duolingo,5,0,challenge yourself to learn more each day!
duolingo,5,0,!
duolingo,5,79,really engaging way to learn a language.
duolingo,5,79,"takes all the mechanics that most mobile games would use to get you addicted and spend money, but uses them to make you want to learn more about your language."
duolingo,5,79,"however, it could definitely benefit from a trading system so that the pp can let you know ""hey, maybe you should retro this specific lesson."""
duolingo,5,3,this pp is amazing.
duolingo,5,3,"it helps cream the words in my mind, and even gives pro tips!"
duolingo,5,3,"yet, one thing wrong is in the spanish lessons you learn to put in sometimes-unnecessary things."
duolingo,5,3,"for example: ""to so juan."""
duolingo,5,3,"the 'to' is not needed, since 'so' already means 'i am'."
duolingo,5,3,"i'm just assuming that you might say 'to so' to be more formal, maybe?"
duolingo,5,3,that's what i don't know.
duolingo,5,3,"otherwise, 5 stars!"
duolingo,5,0,i'm learning japanese right now on domingo and its really easy to get into.
duolingo,5,0,you can start to learn another language if you try this pp.
duolingo,5,0,and it really helps if you combine domingo with a couture video on starting that language.
duolingo,5,0,plus the free version of domingo doesn't have as all in your face they show you a quick add at the end of a lesson and then it's gone.
duolingo,5,0,"try it, it's free!"
duolingo,5,1,i want to rate more than 5 stars.
duolingo,5,1,this is a game.
duolingo,5,1,it feels like a game and it is a lot of fun.
duolingo,5,1,when i play it i also happen to learn another language.
duolingo,5,1,i learned more spanish in the three days since i download domingo than an entire smelter of an online college class.
duolingo,5,1,i do wish this pp could teach proper english writing to a native speaker.
duolingo,5,1,overall domingo exceeded my expectations.
duolingo,5,1,a super fun pp that made spanish easy to learn on the go!
duolingo,5,1,definitely worth mind of my time everyday.
duolingo,5,1,"i got to practice reading, writing and speaking in a fun and interactive way."
duolingo,5,1,it cover the key basic topics such as travel and general conversational.
duolingo,5,1,you get to pick what level you are currently on which is great as i don't know any basic spanish so i got to learn the school basis before it got harder.
duolingo,5,8,the way domingo reaches is very good and shows you many sentence examples that will help you make your own in your language of choice.
duolingo,5,8,the banking system gives the competitive feel and keeps the interest going.
duolingo,5,8,"although there are times that it feels grind, but that's how you actually learn the language and be able to speak and write it."
duolingo,5,8,"i think the office feature is worth purchasing, too."
duolingo,5,8,up: i like the new update where i can now see my 'cracked eggs'.
duolingo,5,2,i love this pp!
duolingo,5,2,"it makes learning a new language easy and quick, and i find myself spending more time on it than i expected to."
duolingo,5,2,"there is an option for a premium version of the pp, but the pp isn't designed in a way that it's unable without it."
duolingo,5,2,"the as aren't intrusion, hearts can be gained with practise, and progress quires aren't really a necessity."
duolingo,5,2,"overall, amazing pp."
duolingo,5,11,fantastic.
duolingo,5,11,"makes learning fun with checkpoints, leaderboards, point systems, badges, positive feedback, and colourful animation."
duolingo,5,11,"it's structures in a way that feels easy, so you don't feel discouraged or overwhelmed, while still getting results."
duolingo,5,11,learning a language requires a lot of repetition.
duolingo,5,11,domingo guides you through this while removing the monotony that usually comes with it.
duolingo,5,1,fairly easy to get into!
duolingo,5,1,"i'm loving it, i like the streak system because it gives you a reason to practice every day."
duolingo,5,1,i think seeing your friends progress (at least for me) makes it so i anna work harder to pass them.
duolingo,5,1,also if would and will definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to learn a new language
duolingo,5,0,domingo is an excellent pp.
duolingo,5,0,the key is to stay consistent and follow the tips about writing down what you learn as you go along through the levels.
duolingo,5,0,the pp tracks your progress and gives great inventive to practice.
duolingo,5,0,"if i could request an additional feature, i'd like an audit/visual section specifically designed, to track nothing but my previously learned words."
duolingo,5,0,"that way, i can repeatedly review words i struggle with or may forget at my own pace, not just when its auto suggested within the pp"
duolingo,5,1,really helpful pp.
duolingo,5,1,"i am using this pp for 1 week now, it's really helping me learn japanese and it have really nice interface.the best thing is that the pp is free and you don't have to give a single penny for learning something."
duolingo,5,1,you can't learn other languages using only this pp though.
duolingo,5,1,you have to learn from other sources too like couture for better and faster results
duolingo,5,15,"i'm nearly 60, and this is the first language learning experience i have truly embraced."
duolingo,5,15,i am practicing all four language skill at my own pace (intensive!)
duolingo,5,15,and feel real progress in just a week.
duolingo,5,15,it offers sufficient repetition for duties like me to really get the details into my brain.
duolingo,5,15,strongly recommend giving it a try.
duolingo,5,15,"i also love the extra - the reading, blows, etc."
duolingo,5,0,excellent and easy way to learn other languages.
duolingo,5,0,worth every penny.
duolingo,5,0,a free pp that does all that you need it to!
duolingo,5,0,"you get to read, write and speak the language which is perfect to help you really learn."
duolingo,5,0,i'm acting through it!
duolingo,5,0,it's a perfect blend of learning a new language & also having fun in the experience.
duolingo,5,0,i love doing it regularly!
duolingo,5,0,great pp.
duolingo,5,0,really makes learning a new language fun and easy.
duolingo,5,0,i would recommend it to anyone who is trying to learn a new language.
duolingo,5,0,"great pp to learn a new language, very helpful and challenging."
duolingo,5,0,"brilliant pp, set out amazingly."
duolingo,5,0,you put in what you get out like everything-enjoying the journey thanks to the domingo team (:
duolingo,5,0,the pp is very simple and easiest way to learn english without any tutor.
duolingo,5,13,i can't believe this is free!
duolingo,5,13,"and now i can't believe i went premium, except wait, of course i did!"
duolingo,5,13,"this is a fabulous thing in my life, and when we go to the netherlands next year, i'll be able to read dutch rather proficient and hold some basic conversations."
duolingo,5,13,"the downside, of course, is that you need to use a language to really know it, and by that i mean converse in it."
duolingo,5,13,but i already find myself reading webster in dutch with relative ease after about 10 months.
duolingo,5,13,"dank je we, do!"
duolingo,5,0,if you want to practice languages anywhere efficiently i highly recommend this one!
duolingo,5,0,excellent liability.
duolingo,5,0,it's surprisingly simple to use with its neat design and layout unlike many apes.
duolingo,5,0,"the exercises, scores and rewards are strategic and motivation."
duolingo,5,0,the best free language learning pp i've come across.
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is the nearest to being entirely free since the free version includes full capacity of all its lessons, while other programs don't let you access full lessons for free."
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp!
duolingo,5,0,it helped me learn spanish.
duolingo,5,0,my friend sophia starting learning danish as well on this pp!
duolingo,5,0,"the only thing i need to say is there shouldn't be an option to remove modifications because since i removed modifications i lost inspiration to learn, but i'm starting again!"
duolingo,5,0,i need to give this pp more than 5 stars!
duolingo,5,0,😃
duolingo,5,0,this is the best pp ever.
duolingo,5,0,so adjective and you can just imagine what that means when the objective is to learn a language!
duolingo,5,0,"i really dont rate apes, but this is a first."
duolingo,5,0,"very educational, helpful and free."
duolingo,5,9,the only pp that i've actually managed to use daily.
duolingo,5,9,lots of mobile games have rewards for logging in daily and still that doesn't motivate me to do so nearly as much as this pp does.
duolingo,5,9,it's super easy to get into and is actually quite fun to learn with this pp.
duolingo,5,9,"with the daily reminders and the customizable daily goals, it is super easy to keep going."
duolingo,5,9,i'm currently on a 100 day streak and have used it every day =d.
duolingo,5,9,edit 1: still going strong.
duolingo,5,9,i only wish the quires were progress based.
duolingo,5,118,i have been using this pp for some years.
duolingo,5,118,the as did take away time especially for daily lessons so i upgrade to paid version.
duolingo,5,118,this pp is really fun to use!
duolingo,5,118,"i like the rotation of different types of nodules and the quick lesson format, both of which keep me engaged."
duolingo,5,118,chasing next level promotion zone is a natural reaction and makes it feel like a game.
duolingo,5,118,i is beautiful and mobile game like.
duolingo,5,118,i don't like memorizing but this all makes it easier.
duolingo,5,0,"the software have serious problems for play the voices , in fact i can't hear any voice"
duolingo,5,0,i really like domingo i've been using it for just over a year and it's very helpful when you want to learn a new language.
duolingo,5,0,the lessons are easy to understand and even if you are having trouble there's an option to ask other people for help.
duolingo,5,0,although i am a little scared of the domingo bird this is a very good pp with very few as.
duolingo,5,12,it really helps me keep up with french ( th grade french) but... it is still really helpful.
duolingo,5,12,"sometimes there will be an error with the sentence for example, on of the questions translated to ""what is you your name?"""
duolingo,5,12,but otherwise it is an awesome pp and i highly recommend it to anyone trying to keep up with homework or learn a new language.
duolingo,5,0,i have never loved an pp as much as i love do!
duolingo,5,0,"and the fact that it takes the form of an actual animal, the owl."
duolingo,5,0,❤️ domingo.
duolingo,5,0,"the stories are really helping me pick up the language faster, that too unconsciously."
duolingo,5,0,i just remember a lot of words just from doing the stories.
duolingo,5,0,adding more stories would be helpful.
duolingo,5,0,"the leaderboards end at the diamond league, but i wish they would work on continuing the leaderboards, as in adding more leagues, it kind of motivate you to practice on a daily basis."
duolingo,5,0,excellent!
duolingo,5,0,easy but gives help and printers where needed.
duolingo,5,0,"simple, helpful and fun"
duolingo,5,0,excellent pp!
duolingo,5,0,it's been incredibly helpful.
duolingo,5,0,"also, with the addition of stories in the spanish lessons i've been learning much quicker!"
duolingo,5,0,"and as a lesion, it was wonderful to see a story involving two women on their honeymoon!"
duolingo,5,0,thanks so much do team!
duolingo,5,6,it's a great and simple way to pick up a language and practice through your free time.
duolingo,5,6,the way the pp is set up makes it very rewarding and educational at the same time.
duolingo,5,6,"i've been using domingo on and off through my years for different things like french class, then spanish class, and now i'm using it again to learn german for my own purposes, not just a class."
duolingo,5,6,i honestly would pick domingo over a private tutor any day because of how convenient it is.
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is awesome, i've had experience with similar apes like memories but it's not even close to do."
duolingo,5,0,one of the best things about domingo is the totally free education which is a rare thing these days.
duolingo,5,0,as are not annoying and the practice to gain hearts is actually really helpful.
duolingo,5,0,i hope you can continue spreading the language knowledge free for ever.
duolingo,5,0,best wishes.
duolingo,5,0,"a great free learning pp when i needed in 2017 was one that helped me to talk and understand english, this pp will always stay in my mind."
duolingo,5,4,i've been using domingo for the past four years (learning german) and honestly it's the best language pp/webster i've ever used.
duolingo,5,4,"the pp let's you practice wherever, and the webster allows you to read and listen to stories so you can hear actual conversations."
duolingo,5,4,"it's better to use it while in a class for your goal language, but even on it's own (my high school doesn't offer german sadly) you're able to learn a lot!"
duolingo,5,0,it's a great pp to learn a new language.
duolingo,5,0,simple and awesome pp.
duolingo,5,0,really enjoy this pp.
duolingo,5,0,the hearts system encourages extra practice.
duolingo,5,0,i keep feeling...just one more lesson
duolingo,5,6,i really enjoy this pp.
duolingo,5,6,"it is quite repetition by level five of each lesson but as i am in my was and find it hard to remember some of the vocabulary, i find that helps me to learn better."
duolingo,5,6,sometimes i wish there was a bit more explanation on some of the grammar elements as you have to try and figure out why you got a translation incorrect.
duolingo,5,6,i use the free version and top up my lives between lessons on the practice sessions.
duolingo,5,6,i like that you can practice completed lessons without losing lives
duolingo,5,8,i have been using this pp for two days now and find it extremely easy to understand.
duolingo,5,8,"it uses a way of learning that fits multiple different people's needs such as auditory learning, written word, reading, excetera."
duolingo,5,8,it uses things in context in ways that make it so you can understand the words and the letters of different alphabet that you want to learn!
duolingo,5,8,i'm currently learning japanese and for the first time in a while i feel like there's progress thank you domingo!
duolingo,5,3,i've used other similar but computer based language programs.
duolingo,5,3,what makes domingo so good is having it on my phone so it's always with me.
duolingo,5,3,"it's optimized for smart phone use, and i can fill in any free time, during lunch, or whenever to practice and study."
duolingo,5,3,new words are highlight with drop down definitions.
duolingo,5,3,i do wish there was an index of words for review.
duolingo,5,3,love it!
duolingo,5,3,"i had done some learning before with audible, but this has been so much better."
duolingo,5,3,it warns you of accents on letters and i'm just doing the nodules i want....i don't need to know about grandparents or school stuff so i can dip in and out.
duolingo,5,3,the lessons may be slightly repetition but that's good....i'm learning a lot and in just a short few minutes a day!
duolingo,5,5,very well designed pp.
duolingo,5,5,"love the leader board, streaks, achievements, and up for added motivation and enjoyment."
duolingo,5,5,the content is great and in learning fast.
duolingo,5,5,i also like the idea that you can get the plus version by sending a link for other players to join.
duolingo,5,5,overall this is a much better pp than i had expected it to be.
duolingo,5,91,this pp is a great learning tool.
duolingo,5,91,"i successfully learned 25 words, definition and proper usage, in 29 minutes."
duolingo,5,91,the short lessons let you learn on the go for free.
duolingo,5,91,"no dealing with large course fees, transportation, due dates or the pressure of dancing, time consuming assignment."
duolingo,5,91,"they're quick, effective lessons that won't overwhelm or interfere with your other daily responsibilities."
duolingo,5,91,hopefully they'll branch out into other subjects as well.
duolingo,5,0,this is a great pp if you want to learn.
duolingo,5,0,it seemed slow initially but as i continued i began to see and appreciate the repetition.
duolingo,5,0,"it introduces material slowly and has you practice, practice, practice."
duolingo,5,0,"that is what i needed when i was taking spanish classes, but never took the time."
duolingo,5,0,thank you domingo.
duolingo,5,2,¡much gusto!
duolingo,5,2,domingo is a way of learning languages and doing so in the go.
duolingo,5,2,but it's more than reading the words.
duolingo,5,2,"you can learn key phrases, practice speaking them, listen to podcasts, the features are pretty deep for a learning pp."
duolingo,5,2,"therefore, if you want to brush up on a new language or refresh after some time away from speaking that language, domingo is the best pp to date...a modern day roseola stone for the digital age."
duolingo,5,0,"i hope that by ""bags,""you are referring to the vertical display of lessons for tablet users."
duolingo,5,0,i love domingo plus and have been using it for years.
duolingo,5,0,it is one of the joys of my life.
duolingo,5,0,if it can't be fixed i will have to live with it.
duolingo,5,0,i'm not going anywhere.
duolingo,5,0,"but i would love to be able to use it as it was in the beginning, a horizontal keyboard."
duolingo,5,0,i would still recommend domingo to anyone who wants to learn a language.
duolingo,5,0,once kent
duolingo,5,0,i've had a wonderful experience with domingo as an pp and language teacher.
duolingo,5,0,does exactly what it says on the tin.
duolingo,5,0,i only wish it had a word library for the language you're studying so you can see all of them and which ones are struggle with the most.
duolingo,5,0,i had thought they had such a feature in the past.
duolingo,5,0,the program has been fun.
duolingo,5,0,it could use a better vocabulary list to view before the lesson.
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp.
duolingo,5,0,"it is a very straightforward language learn pp and doesn't seek to completely ""ramify"" the experience but it still manages to keep my interest and motivate me to keep learning, practicing, and progressing."
duolingo,5,0,plus i feel oddly encouraged when the little owl pips out and says nice things.
duolingo,5,0,very good quality language learning software!
duolingo,5,0,good for gaining speaking skill along with learning the little things to becoming client in a language.
duolingo,5,0,the only downside is the 5 heart health system.
duolingo,5,0,i would much prefer to learn without using a health system.
duolingo,5,0,this is a great pp for the new years because my resolution was to learn a new language and this pp is helping me meet that goal!
duolingo,5,0,a very fun way to learn and practice a foreign language!
duolingo,5,0,truly motivation!
duolingo,5,0,i definitely recommend this!
duolingo,5,0,this is a very very very good language learning pp.
duolingo,5,0,i love it.
duolingo,5,0,it's the best pp for free learning.
duolingo,5,0,thanks for the owners of this pp.
duolingo,5,0,very good.
duolingo,5,0,as are annoying though and you keep losing progress when you are interrupted
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp.
duolingo,5,0,i've already began speaking short sentences in my job at the hospital in less th a's n 2 short weeks.
duolingo,5,0,great pp.
duolingo,5,0,it makes learning a different language fun and enjoyable.
duolingo,5,0,it's very easy to build up skill on any language through the apes as it guide you systematic way .
duolingo,5,0,i love this language pp and the fact that you don't have to pay for premium to learn any language you want.
duolingo,5,0,i really appreciate that.
duolingo,5,0,:)
duolingo,5,0,"it's nice pp to start learning a foreign language...easy , interactive and engaging"
duolingo,5,0,this pp is great!
duolingo,5,0,makes me feel that i can learn new languages very easy.
duolingo,5,0,great way of learning languages!!
duolingo,5,0,definitely recommend it!
duolingo,5,0,!
duolingo,5,1,domingo is to the point and easily accessible.
duolingo,5,1,navigation easy.
duolingo,5,0,fun and easy way to learn a language.
duolingo,5,0,i've been learning irish for a while now.
duolingo,5,0,just wish they had scottish garlic.
duolingo,5,0,that would make me love it with nothing ill to say about it.
duolingo,5,0,edit: scottish garlic for english speakers is here!
duolingo,5,0,but i'm not happy about clubs being gone.
duolingo,5,0,i miss it.
duolingo,5,0,that's one of the only reasons i can think of for why i wouldn't like it.
duolingo,5,0,p.s.
duolingo,5,0,"i'm on andros, so there is no heart system."
duolingo,5,0,i love it so much😀!!!!!
duolingo,5,0,"i like how they added so many more languages 🇮🇹🇳🇱🇱🇷,so i can learn lots of them.in school i learn french and with domingo i can get a higher mark."
duolingo,5,0,"but i don't like how you added a heart❤ ,now i can't play for long because it takes away a heart every time i get a question wrong.if you only have 1 heart left and your half way through a lesson,and make a mistake you have to pay or you quit the lesson and i can't pay so i have to quit."
duolingo,5,0,😣😭 but the rest of it is good.
duolingo,5,2,"very well done, it is rare to see an pp providing such comprehensive teachings and exercises for free (there are many stages and each has a few levels so you can be familiar with what you have learnt)... and each exercise is short, which makes it handy for those who are busy (i use this pp while i am traveling to school) i highly recommend this pp to you all :d and am currently learning german, good luck to you all!"
duolingo,5,3,this is a great system.
duolingo,5,3,good use of different tools to match preferred learning style.
duolingo,5,3,liked the fun and the competitive elements coupled with in pp incentive.
duolingo,5,3,also it really works.
duolingo,5,3,"i have tried many language learning systems and this one has delivered more progress in a couple of months at half an hour a day (more if i am having lots of fun), than others achieved with me in a couple of years!"
duolingo,5,3,top marks domingo!
duolingo,5,3,spanish next!
duolingo,5,3,"or maybe italian, or irish....."
duolingo,5,0,"i honestly thought i wasn't going to learn anything and that this pp would be super hard, but honestly i feel like its taught me so much in so little time."
duolingo,5,0,it's easy to use and it's fun!
duolingo,5,0,its so exciting.
duolingo,5,0,its like a game.
duolingo,5,0,learning have never been so easy and so much fun.
duolingo,5,0,great pp
duolingo,5,0,i love the pp and i've only had for about a week.
duolingo,5,0,"one small question, is it normal that for organ alphabet lesson 3 i keep getting questions about cities and starbucks?"
duolingo,5,0,i had those at basis 1 (borrowed words)
duolingo,5,1,it is great using domingo on andros and computer and it can help you learn a language free no matter you are a beginner or not.
duolingo,5,1,there are many languages to learn and i really suggest clinking on tips to learn deeper.
duolingo,5,1,"it helps you listen, speak, read and write and when you need more real communications, you can join events at your neighborhood."
duolingo,5,1,love it a lot.
duolingo,5,0,i personally love it it's a nice language learning pp but to really benefit you must use it regularly
duolingo,5,0,very helpful for practice and we can also learn any languages easily.
duolingo,5,2,i'm a beginner learning french and i love this pp.
duolingo,5,2,"i am quite competitive so this pp is great for my learning because it allows me to ""compete"" with others in getting to the next ""level""."
duolingo,5,2,i also really like a possibility of practicing different nasal sounds that are so difficult about french (there are exercises that get you to recognise very similar sounding combinations of letters and there are also opportunities to pronounce words and phrases where it tells you if you got it right or not.
duolingo,5,0,"i really love this pp , it's truly amazing you can learn so many languages with easiest ways and how it encourages you!"
duolingo,5,0,", i personally love french and i tried learning it and i can say i can talk in it good not client yet but it's truly incredible ."
duolingo,5,0,i recommend using it cause it's truly amazing and easy to use.
duolingo,5,0,thanks for making this pp💕
duolingo,5,1,"interesting approach, and it works!"
duolingo,5,1,"you learn a foreign language without even noticing it 😆 personally i'd love a bit more grammar (a lot of it, actually) but then again, domingo helps you getting accustomed to the new language well enough so it's up to you to go even further..., like, for instance, to study it at any superior (academic) level you'd like."
duolingo,5,1,"and, quite important, it sports such a lovely interface :) great job, domingo!"
duolingo,5,0,great experience and a fun way to learn.
duolingo,5,0,it would be greater if the pp does not stop sending modifications after a few days and maybe a little bit of change concerning the content of the notifocations would be greater as well.
duolingo,5,0,thank you!
duolingo,5,1,"fantastic way to learn another language i have had a really hard time in other classes and programs learning spanish, but this is actually enjoyable and game like that it makes it easy to learn, it's also really repetition to where the farther you get in you feel like you naturally know the words, and it's legitimate free where you're not wrapped into not exceeding without upbraiding."
duolingo,5,1,highly recommend.
duolingo,5,0,"i picked up the pp to refresh my high school french, and it has been efficacious."
duolingo,5,0,"i've been mostly taking very small, sub-10-minute lessons, improving slowly with practically no impact on my schedule, but i expect it would also support a far more focused effort, with the quit, stories and podcast functions they've added."
duolingo,5,0,excellent.
duolingo,5,0,only wish the stories were longer.
duolingo,5,0,and an interactive vocal list.
duolingo,5,1,domingo has been a useful and nicely structures way to keep myself involved daily with the languages i enjoy.
duolingo,5,1,"by itself it probably won't make you client, but combined with some classes or tutoring it is a nice way to practice and learn."
duolingo,5,1,"there are some pretty frequent jokes to purchase the upgrade, but they are not obnoxious and the free version is pretty powerful."
duolingo,5,0,a great way to learn and practice languages.
duolingo,5,0,"some things needed: 1. some better explanations on grammar rules, especially ones in the learning language but not present in the native language (e.g."
duolingo,5,0,formal).
duolingo,5,0,2. it would be nice to change the colour slightly on the entry box depending on whether the learning or native language is required.
duolingo,5,0,so many times i enter the wrong language.
duolingo,5,0,3. where's tagalog?
duolingo,5,0,it seems there are filipinos wherever i travel and there over 100m native speakers.
duolingo,5,0,excellent interface.
duolingo,5,0,well paced lessons.
duolingo,5,0,endure that you correct your mistakes.
duolingo,5,0,great tool for beginners to get familiar with the basis and to develop confidence while learning a new language.
duolingo,5,0,"reading, writing, listening and speaking are involved in the process, which makes it more fun and engaging."
duolingo,5,0,all gradually and at the pace you choose.
duolingo,5,0,thank you for all the work you've done refining this pp.
duolingo,5,7,absolutely love this pp.
duolingo,5,7,"when you have trouble with words or phrases, it gives you questions containing them more frequently so that you can correct your problem areas promptly."
duolingo,5,7,"even drops in for a few little ""congress on your hard work!"""
duolingo,5,7,messages as you practice.
duolingo,5,7,"its a very comfortable, fun and easy way to learn a language."
duolingo,5,1,"although its an awesome language learning pp, but sometimes during in any particular section of language, it goes few steps ahead without the person who is learning having any clue for it, so i would just like to suggest that, it would be nice if you make or sections easier and dont advance rapidly to another step without clearing up all the previous doubts"
duolingo,5,10,really good language learning pp.
duolingo,5,10,there are a few issues that could be improved.
duolingo,5,10,sometimes it assumes you've already learned a word and asks you what it means.
duolingo,5,10,i already knew some of the language i am learning so it didn't happen often.
duolingo,5,10,"this is great at teaching you how to read, spell and speak the words."
duolingo,5,10,not great for grammar and reasons why things are done a certain way.
duolingo,5,1,domingo is easy to use and a great way to learn a language or refresh one's knowledge through short daily exercises.
duolingo,5,1,"it's good if you just want to learn a language to communicate in it but if one wants to understand it more from grammatical point of view, one has to use other apes, webster or books."
duolingo,5,1,"however, this is not a flaw as it is not it's purpose."
duolingo,5,13,there is not enough space in this comment section for me to express how much i love this pp!!
duolingo,5,13,i've been using domingo for 2 years now and haven't had any problems or unexpected clashes.
duolingo,5,13,this pp works fearlessly!
duolingo,5,13,oh and you will learn the language you choose.
duolingo,5,13,couldn't be easier!
duolingo,5,13,best educational/language learning pp available on any platform.
duolingo,5,13,i love domingo!!
duolingo,5,13,!
duolingo,5,10,amazing.
duolingo,5,10,i love it!
duolingo,5,10,it's fun & i look forward to using the pp daily.
duolingo,5,10,"i'm a complete beginner and really feel like it has helped me read, write, and say words in spanish little by little."
duolingo,5,10,i'm confident i can become client or get close to it if i keep at it.
duolingo,5,10,my boyfriend also has the pp and enjoys it.
duolingo,5,10,he encouraged me to use it.
duolingo,5,10,he uses it to brush up on his spanish so he can help me if i have questions.
duolingo,5,10,i like how you can add friends through the pp and see how they are doing.
duolingo,5,2,this pp is really great!
duolingo,5,2,but i really would like if the time if the lives (in the premium version) will be shorten a bit because i'm always studying the course that i picked everyday when i have time.
duolingo,5,2,and it turns out that i really have many time to study the courses that i chose.
duolingo,5,2,"it's okay though, since the practice also helps me get better."
duolingo,5,2,i really love this pp since it makes my studying in languages is better that the other apes that i have tried.
duolingo,5,0,"super helpful, one of the best apes out there to learn a new language from scratch"
duolingo,5,0,no.
duolingo,5,0,"1 pp for learning new languages hands down, although some languages are a little only they have a great feedback system"
duolingo,5,0,great pp.
duolingo,5,0,i use it when i have free time instead of wasting my time on other social media platforms
duolingo,5,0,the best way to start.
duolingo,5,0,"i will recommend something like some grammar pills, but the rest is just perfect."
duolingo,5,0,"very easy to use pp, extremely well thought out engagement approach to keep the user engaged."
duolingo,5,0,steady pace which suits me.
duolingo,5,0,clever use of learned words.
duolingo,5,0,would recommend.
duolingo,5,0,"very easy to use, and i'm actually learning the language."
duolingo,5,0,highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn a new language in just a few minutes a day.
duolingo,5,0,i breaking love this pp!
duolingo,5,0,i've been able to learn welsh and the use of visual really helps!
duolingo,5,0,exceptional but though the letters are bit confusing in terms of survive or book type.
duolingo,5,6,i love learning languages on domingo.
duolingo,5,6,"i've tried irish, german, italian, organ, polish and greek so far."
duolingo,5,6,only thing i'd like more of is more pronunciation help in the lessons.
duolingo,5,6,"for a free pp, this one is great!"
duolingo,5,6,"ok, when i actually took the time to click on every possible thing in pp, i found pronunciation help and extra guidance upon clinking the light bulb icon."
duolingo,5,6,perfect.
duolingo,5,0,"update, great pp, very user friendly making learning fun."
duolingo,5,0,"i have learned so much spanish in so little time, recently however i have been unable to access lessons when office, though i am a plus subscribe."
duolingo,5,0,"i have contracted domingo support, but not heard back yet."
duolingo,5,0,this is particularly important to me as i travel a lot and it would be useful to use the pp when on a long flight
duolingo,5,0,awesome experience.
duolingo,5,0,it gets the job done slowly but surely.
duolingo,5,0,anyone determined can learn a language for free!
duolingo,5,0,i highly recommend domingo to anyone.
duolingo,5,1,"accessible, effective, and fun."
duolingo,5,1,the graphics and voices are pleasant.
duolingo,5,1,"good variety of ways to practice, with the option to test out of basic levels when ready."
duolingo,5,1,there are just enough game-like features to motivate extra study.
duolingo,5,1,"for example, errors cost ❤️; i love that you can earn extra ❤️s by practicing."
duolingo,5,1,"awards for ""streaks,"" consistency, etc."
duolingo,5,1,"as appear regularly in the free version, between lessons, clearly identified."
duolingo,5,1,"watching video as is optional, and ears gems you can spend in the game."
duolingo,5,0,i feel relaxed and confident when using domingo and am surprised at the amount of vocabulary i've learnt in such a short space of time.
duolingo,5,2,"well designed pp, that works very efficiently and which has finally made some basic rules of latin stick in my memory."
duolingo,5,2,"the only complaint is, apart from italy and rome, the use of mostly i american place names, which won't ever come up in classic or ecclesiastical latin literature, which is what i at want to be able to read eventually."
duolingo,5,224,i love this pp!
duolingo,5,224,it feels like a game which actually does makes learning the language fun.
duolingo,5,224,i really like that if you run out of hearts you're able to gain more by doing a practice round.. it forces you to go over the same words and phrases and verb tense over and over in order to continue and it makes retaining the information very easy.
duolingo,5,224,i'm 2 weeks into learning german and can't believe how much i've retained.
duolingo,5,0,easy to use interface and fun challenges make domingo represent a significant help for learning vocabulary of a language.
duolingo,5,0,should be treated as a compliment to other methods of language learning and not a standalone tool.
duolingo,5,0,on a 1010 day streak now with no signs of stopping!
duolingo,5,0,overall a great companion tool for language earners.
duolingo,5,0,the best pp to get the basis of a language.
duolingo,5,0,it makes it quite fun and the league can sometimes really motivate :)
duolingo,5,0,this is the best game ever!
duolingo,5,0,this is the first time i see a language learning game that doesn't need to be paid.
duolingo,5,0,"at first, from what people were saying on couture, i thought at first this was a horror game until i searched up 'language learning' this was the first thing that came up."
duolingo,5,0,keep up this great game!
duolingo,5,0,"just getting started, but the best part seems to be that i can squeeze in 5 minutes of practice anywhere."
duolingo,5,0,great pp to learn a language quickly!
duolingo,5,0,cuts to the chase
duolingo,5,1,this is a delightful pp that build up my language skill in a fun way.
duolingo,5,1,"i stated from nothing and i'm learning very quickly, enjoying it all along."
duolingo,5,1,i've been learning for nearly two months now and still enjoying it a lot.
duolingo,5,1,"today i discovered the story section on the webster, which is lots of fun now that i've learned quite a bit of vocal."
duolingo,5,0,i love working on this (almost) every day.
duolingo,5,0,refreshing my spanish over the last year has been great.
duolingo,5,0,recently i started scottish garlic which is so much fun.
duolingo,5,0,"dear do, for languages like garlic it would be very helpful to have an audit also on the pick one of three tasks."
duolingo,5,0,and i would love a course in mori and one of token's pelvis languages.
duolingo,5,0,thank you for providing free and fun education :)
duolingo,5,0,domingo is great!
duolingo,5,0,this is not a helpful review because there would be so much stuff to say about how awesome it is!
duolingo,5,0,so i am not going to list all that stuff that would persuade you to get the pp.
duolingo,5,0,"i am just going to say that i highly recommend it, especially if you are a student currently learning a large like me."
duolingo,5,0,great pp.
duolingo,5,0,maybe add some more languages.
duolingo,5,0,but overall it is good.
duolingo,5,0,really excellent pp.
duolingo,5,0,"it really has helped me learn french in a simple, fun way."
duolingo,5,0,love ❤️ the heart system...awesome and free!
duolingo,5,0,so far it's working pretty well.
duolingo,5,0,i like the different ways you practice and learn vocabulary and sentence structure.
duolingo,5,0,"it sometimes feels repetition, but hey that's how you learn."
duolingo,5,0,i also like the environment (the podcast and things) that let you experience the language in different ways.
duolingo,5,0,"this pp is so incredible, because you can learn more languages, and is so funny to use!"
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is a very easy pp to use it helped me learn new words, but the hearts kind suck but they do have practice on domingo witch i do every day!"
duolingo,5,0,i recommend learning bowels and continents first it really helps!!!
duolingo,5,0,but i definitely recommend this pp for anyone.
duolingo,5,0,it's the most helpful and the best language application i've ever used and been using it for 1 year now.
duolingo,5,0,"only got one problem in its new update about the sound of the word; when i click on the words to listen to, no sound is played."
duolingo,5,0,appreciate if this problem can be fixed.
duolingo,5,0,big thanks to domingo's team♥️
duolingo,5,116,this pp is by far one of the best things i've ever download.
duolingo,5,116,"not only has do convinced me to stop wasting time watching brain-dead couture video, i can now actually speak in a different language!"
duolingo,5,116,"also the whole stories feature is great as it gives a fairly good stimulation of how conversations are held, which in turn is vital for becoming proficient in a language."
duolingo,5,0,fun and easy to use.
duolingo,5,0,very practical for language learning.
duolingo,5,0,domingo is the best free language learning pp i've used.
duolingo,5,0,it's efficient for what it is and is still growing as they update it.

duolingo,5,0,thoroughly enjoy!
duolingo,5,0,this pp is amazing at helping me learn a foreign language!
duolingo,5,0,so many to choose from and they make it fun!
duolingo,5,0,would recommend 100 percent!
duolingo,5,0,easy to use and provides the necessary repetition for learning a foreign language.
duolingo,5,0,awesome the best pp for studying new languages.
duolingo,5,0,it provides speaking and writing exercises and new vocabulary words to learn.
duolingo,5,0,i just want dark mode pus
duolingo,5,0,it's very educational and guides me at a slow pace and it's an excellent language learning experience
duolingo,5,0,love this pp it is great!
duolingo,5,0,works very well for understanding words!
duolingo,5,0,why i can't hear the pronunciation?
duolingo,5,0,i reinstate the pp but it doesn't solve the problem.
duolingo,5,0,great free pp.
duolingo,5,0,i am very quickly brushing up on my spanish with their easy to follow and multi dimensions lessons.
duolingo,5,0,set up just like those adjective games but learning quickly at the same time.
duolingo,5,0,i can't wait each day for a moment to play again.
duolingo,5,0,"i enjoy these podcasts- varied subjects give the opportunity to learn diverse vocabulary; the true stories are inspiring, they spread progressive ideas and/or give a good insight into latinoamerican ways of life, culture, history but also of difficulties these countries encounter nowadays."
duolingo,5,1,"i prefer the old version that doesn't have lives, the reason i use domingo is because you don't need lives like all the other language learning apes."
duolingo,5,1,"with the current version, nothing is special about it please get the original with lights instead of gems and no need for live, it without these doesn't set domingo apart from any other language learning pp."
duolingo,5,0,great pp and you get a good amount of tools for free.
duolingo,5,0,the only issue i have is that for languages i've studied before its hard to find the right placement for myself.
duolingo,5,0,some skill are high level other parts low so i don't know how to assess myself.
duolingo,5,0,the tool itself is wonderful!
duolingo,5,0,it is a great software.
duolingo,5,0,but i have a request.
duolingo,5,0,"i didn buy the software but using it by watching adds.can you please let us use the nodules office which ever we already completed (because, as we have already supported your good pp by watching required number of adds for those completed nodules)...i think in this way you can more promote your good work towards free education."
duolingo,5,0,thank you in advance...
duolingo,5,0,i am finding the pp easy to navigable.
duolingo,5,0,"if you're not a paid subscribe there is a free practice option that gives you extra time to really learn what you have done during a lesson, when you run out of hearts."
duolingo,5,0,it is great so far!
duolingo,5,0,i am learning and pretty quickly it seems.
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp so far!
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp.
duolingo,5,0,"it's so much fun, smart and easy."
duolingo,5,0,and i am really learning!
duolingo,5,0,"si, si, es may buena!"
duolingo,5,0,here's an update five months later: i have been using the plus version and practicing daily and have learned so much.
duolingo,5,0,i highly recommend this program.
duolingo,5,0,i'm not very good with learning new stuff but this has helped me beyond my dreams.
duolingo,5,0,i know many people can just go and not look back but i have to frequently go back and do it all again and again and again.
duolingo,5,0,and i'm able to keep visiting the areas i need to the most.
duolingo,5,0,thank you for making a program that i can work on at my desire.
duolingo,5,0,"i know there are others like me out there, well this is what you need if you truly want to learn other languages."
duolingo,5,0,good luck and keep going forward.
duolingo,5,0,"it really helps with learning a language, if you want to learn a language for free just click on the pp."
duolingo,5,0,this a well designed pp that not only reaches you a language but encourages you to keep practicing skill you've already learned so you don't lose them.
duolingo,5,0,and it does it all for free.
duolingo,5,0,"yes, there are adds but they don't take away from the experience."
duolingo,5,0,i'm having fun learning a language and i didn't think that would ever happen.
duolingo,5,0,"easy to operate, mostly very accurate - a boon to learning a language!"
duolingo,5,5,"a current difference with the desktop version is that it costs five lights to test out of a level, but you can also earn double lights for watching an add."
duolingo,5,5,"the desktop version currently costs no lights to test out, and there are no video as."
duolingo,5,5,if you are in bed you can tell it you can't listen or speak now and audit questions will be suspended for an hour.
duolingo,5,5,once you hit checkpoint one you can read stories.
duolingo,5,5,in the german course they are cut and humorous.
duolingo,5,5,the whole learning experience is great!
duolingo,5,0,"i think it's awesome, i'm really learning!"
duolingo,5,0,there could be more peaks with the paid version though :)
duolingo,5,0,a very smart pp.
duolingo,5,0,"play with a benefit, learn in an easy, fun way."
duolingo,5,2,"it's great, but i wouldn't call it perfect, however, for learning languages like german, english, swedish, russian, chinese, arabic and more, domingo is perfect for getting a very good understanding of whichever language you're trying to learn."
duolingo,5,2,"and i appreciate them having option like naval and hawaiian, so domingo, rock on!"
duolingo,5,0,"this is hands down the best pp or technique i've used for learning a new language...i did rossetta stone for months and only retained a fraction.... still early in getting serious with learning, but so far i'm finding myself recognizing things and instantly translating them not just remembering that a symbol means something in my native tongue but actually picturing the thing in my mind sans english word!"
duolingo,5,0,i like the pp they make it easy and fun to learn and they really work with you in trying to progress.
duolingo,5,2,"having been using it for more than one year, i am really impressed by domingo for its concise and smart layout, systematic course design and various incentive to help you progress!"
duolingo,5,2,"recently i just got the new offering of short stories, really love it!"
duolingo,5,2,the stories are funny and very useful!
duolingo,5,1,native english speaker in the us.
duolingo,5,1,i've been using domingo for years!
duolingo,5,1,"after i took german in high school, i wanted to continue learning."
duolingo,5,1,"the most recent update added ""stories"" & that has been the best thing it's ever had."
duolingo,5,1,"this let's you read, & hear, a realistic conversation between people."
duolingo,5,1,"the words can then be tapped to review what they mean, & you learn a lot through the context!"
duolingo,5,1,"i've been very pleased with it as a basic learning course, but be sure to use external material to learn!"
duolingo,5,0,"like that it provides exercise with different language skill, including not only vocal exercise, but also listening and speaking practice."
duolingo,5,0,like that it even has speaking practice with a voice detection function to see if the pronunciation are correct.
duolingo,5,0,would be great if there are more advanced levels of learning.
duolingo,5,0,honestly a fun and easy way to learn something so very very valuable!
duolingo,5,1,just started as a beginner but so far it seems to be teaching in a way that i retain because i am already able to use what i have learned to start communicating with my much more advanced wife.
duolingo,5,1,it is very fun so far.
duolingo,5,1,you have to remember to fill your heart health to make sure you don't lose your progress!!
duolingo,5,1,!
duolingo,5,0,absolutely amazing!
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp.
duolingo,5,0,it makes learning languages fun and effective.
duolingo,5,3,i've only been using domingo for a few days but i enjoy every second.
duolingo,5,3,it can be quite repetition but i'm sure that's why it's effective.
duolingo,5,3,the way the exercises vary in format help with true comprehension.
duolingo,5,3,so far i love it!
duolingo,5,3,will probably pay for the plus version without adds.
duolingo,5,0,it's great.
duolingo,5,0,it takes its time to teach you slowly.
duolingo,5,0,before each lesson you can click a little icon and it gives you a renown of what you'll be learning.
duolingo,5,0,"i'm about 1 month into my german lessons and i feel confident that if i stick this out, it would only take a few more months for me to feel comfortable holding a conversation."
duolingo,5,0,love how it progresses in difficulty and provides different ways to learn.
duolingo,5,11,i like the fact that i can be learning while waiting for the elevator or the train.
duolingo,5,11,the step by step and repetition help a lot!
duolingo,5,11,and i love the new feature of speaking into the microphone as a test question.
duolingo,5,11,that's awesome!
duolingo,5,11,i wish i could be taught some words before being tested on them.
duolingo,5,11,"but often times, one can press on the word for the translation so that helps."
duolingo,5,0,lots of fun and learning a new skill.
duolingo,5,0,as adjective as a game.
duolingo,5,0,really great.
duolingo,5,1,"wonderful, i'm loving it, easy to use and you have taken many efforts to teach the languages that's really awesome."
duolingo,5,1,plus everything's free 😇now.
duolingo,5,1,"only one concern, please make available more practice for speaking, otherwise learning, reading,writing is very nice and easy to understand."
duolingo,5,1,🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 rest all the available features are too good🔥
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp, i've been on it for about an hour and already know a lot of basic swedish and i find it very fun, i also love how practicing more can get you more hearts to practice more."
duolingo,5,0,it makes it really easy and i'm really proud of myself.
duolingo,5,4,i would like for italian & japanese to be added to domingo stories.
duolingo,5,4,it's a pretty useful tool.
duolingo,5,4,i've been using it for spanish & it helps me better understand the language more than the regular way of studying with domingo.
duolingo,5,4,the regular way is also good.
duolingo,5,4,but seems like more of a way to reinforce what i've learned for me.
duolingo,5,4,so i wouldn't want to get rid of the regular way.
duolingo,5,0,"nice pp, learning easy and fun and helps to learn different languages and u can take 4-5 languages at one account, the best facilities of this pp are we can take many language on one account, makes learning easy and fun for free, it freeze but get back to normal at 4 seconds!"

duolingo,5,0,"it'll be better that can connect with friends live, such as live chats, audit calls.from that we can resolve our language matters with natives."
duolingo,5,0,i love it because the hearts make you focus more and its so easy to learn and how you can learn multiple languages on the same pp its just a perfect pp and i love it and so do all my friends!
duolingo,5,0,"i shared this pp with my friends and my family ,my sisters are learning japanese and my dad is learning french to!"

duolingo,5,0,super fun to use to learn a language.
duolingo,5,0,but always remember that you need be following a course as well.
duolingo,5,0,"this application can be used just for learning new words sentence formation, not for learning proper grammar."
duolingo,5,3,"i love this pp, but i do have a few ideas: 1) have personal data (e.g most up earn in one day, longest streak, etc) accessible so that we can compete with ourselves as well as others; 2) give us proper profile pages which could display this data publicly, including information about how long we have been using the pp and similar details; 3) let us set goals, eg no."
duolingo,5,3,of crowns in amount of time and give us ways to track our progress on these goals.
duolingo,5,3,thank you for putting stories on the pp!!!!
duolingo,5,3,!
duolingo,5,0,really helpful and instructive.
duolingo,5,0,easy to follow with target to aim for.
duolingo,5,0,"as an older person, whose memory is not as it once was, the lessons are very constructive and encouraging."

duolingo,5,1,it all adds up.
duolingo,5,1,"there are a few minor bags in some lessons, but nothing that really inhibit enjoying the learning process."
duolingo,5,1,deserved popular and recommended.
duolingo,5,0,"since domingo is so well established and probably the best pp for learning foreign languages, perhaps it's time to supplement some parts with some grammatical explanations about the various linguistic phenomena (such as common tends) for the additional benefit of the learner."
duolingo,5,0,pretty good pp.
duolingo,5,0,"but should show the translation of the words you are asked to recognise by sound, as is meaningless if you don't know what they are...and goose doesn't or can't translate either, as that's not that good either!"
duolingo,5,0,"so, you don't improve on the wee words!!"
duolingo,5,0,"otherwise, am enjoying and am learning."
duolingo,5,0,absolutely one of the best apes for learning different lingo.. definitely easy to use and learn from.
duolingo,5,0,found this pp brilliant to use in learning a new language.
duolingo,5,0,"good repetition, and introduction to new words plus the encouragement of practice hearts to progress with learning."
duolingo,5,0,you can also slow down the speech to make it easier to translate to your chosen language.
duolingo,5,0,great pp.
duolingo,5,0,although i am just at the beginning stages of learning it is fun and information
duolingo,5,1,currently am unable to hear the choice of sounds at the start of each lesson.
duolingo,5,1,"the audit description comes through fine, but the four option are not spoken once pressed."
duolingo,5,1,otherwise great.
duolingo,5,1,really like the restore function for completed lessons to ensure you don't leave behind previously learned content.
duolingo,5,5,this pp has been great at motivation me to learn a new language as well as refresh me on languages i've learned a little.
duolingo,5,5,i'm also learning new ways to say things in languages i was already familiar with.
duolingo,5,5,for beginners i strongly recommend that you click the lightbulb before starting a lesson test.
duolingo,5,5,the lightbulb takes you to a page that explains the lesson.
duolingo,5,5,most seem to miss that aspect of domingo and get upset when they are immediately asked about words and phrases they don't know.
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp i am learning french, spanish and welsh and i never dreamed of learning any language."
duolingo,5,0,it not got a lot of as and is a fun way of learning.
duolingo,5,0,if you want feedback i would add little games in between to help you and to know what you struggle with.

duolingo,5,0,"i love learning on here, it helps with all the relation."
duolingo,5,0,"one thing i would be nice to add is if there was a section with all the words we learned, definition and translation."
duolingo,5,0,so that way for those of us who don't write it down we still have a section to go back to and practice!
duolingo,5,0,great way to learn or refresh a language.
duolingo,5,0,great for daily use.
duolingo,5,1,this pp is really helping me practice and learn in a simple graceful way!
duolingo,5,1,"i'm really grateful for the flow of the lessons, and the convenience of learning from my phone whenever i please."
duolingo,5,1,thank you thank you thank you.

duolingo,5,0,:)
duolingo,5,0,i've been hooked on this for a few days now.
duolingo,5,0,"i've lived in china for a few years, mingled in japanese in college, and had a couple of awesome russian roommates."
duolingo,5,0,this pp is great for touching up on languages i haven't spoken in a while and has been teaching me russian at a surprising pace (cyrillic is no joke).
duolingo,5,0,sometimes i put in an answer that should be accepted but it's not for some reason
duolingo,5,0,not a big deal.
duolingo,5,0,"oh, and it's 100% free"
duolingo,5,0,"i've download this pp for three times but at each time the sound of this pp become mute ,could you guide me to solve this problem?"
duolingo,5,0,!
duolingo,5,0,"intuition, fun, and interesting."
duolingo,5,0,"top notch, superb - five stars, hands down!"
duolingo,5,0,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
duolingo,5,0,solid start in domingo.
duolingo,5,0,"started with spanish, to which i did have some previous experience learning."
duolingo,5,0,though it never really took back then.
duolingo,5,0,it seems to be taking now.
duolingo,5,0,"not sure yet if that's because of the previous base and the ten thousandth time is the charm for me, or if these short, repetition, simple lessons really help build an understanding."
duolingo,5,0,i'm willing to give domingo the credit!
duolingo,5,0,overall it's still a more fun method of learning than spanish 1 in school or random learn spanish d's.
duolingo,5,0,"pp is fully free, there are as to support the pp, but it's not intrusion or anything."
duolingo,5,0,the pp is also good and very well done.
duolingo,5,0,"the only ""bad point"" is the lack of explanation, so i would say that if you are really planning to learn, it's a side tool :)"
duolingo,5,2,from my experience domingo is actually a very good way to learn a foreign language.

duolingo,5,0,been using free version for couple weeks.
duolingo,5,0,"i have started with french as i once had 7 years instruction, though the last year for this was 38 years ago and i did not keep up usage of the language so have lost most of it; though apparently not as much as i thought as i'm doing very well."
duolingo,5,0,the reminders for lesson times are appreciated and not unobtrusive.
duolingo,5,0,i hope this can get me to conversational level sooner than book study.
duolingo,5,0,the garlic course is very enjoyable.

duolingo,5,5,"pretty good for practicing a language you've already had a bit of experience in, but i don't think it's the best for learning languages that don't use standard letters found in english, french, etc., like japanese or organ."
duolingo,5,5,"it simply doesn't go into enough details about the basis and just shoves it in your face, making new earners become discouraged from being overwhelmed."
duolingo,5,5,i suggest having some other beginner-friendly apes before trying to learn one of those languages on here.
duolingo,5,0,i do not know all language learning apes but from the ones that i know this is by far the best pp.
duolingo,5,0,i usually hate apes with as but i do understand their importance for you from a business perspective and their necessity.
duolingo,5,0,i hope it will always remain free.

duolingo,5,0,"from what i've used so far its excellent, repetition so that you can memories the words well."
duolingo,5,0,it takes time to learn and remember the language so i've learnt that you need to be patient with the pp as you won't learn it in 2 weeks but it could be months the more you use it.
duolingo,5,0,the best way to start learning a language i've ever tried (not there have been many) fun to pick up and easy to get started!

duolingo,5,2,the course is simple to follow and the forum allows for queried to be answered.
duolingo,5,2,"i haven't used podcasts yet, but the stories help."
duolingo,5,2,my only area of regret with the system is the abuse of extra points.
duolingo,5,2,there are some who compound more points than time allows and this stops target being achieved.
duolingo,5,2,"but, this course is still the best for learning a language and not just basic conversational ability."
duolingo,5,2,i have recommended domingo and there is now a group of six of us studying together.
duolingo,5,0,it really is free!

duolingo,5,9,"to me, the use of contextualized stories is brilliant and entertaining."
duolingo,5,9,i highly recommend this pp if you are interested in learning a new language.

duolingo,5,0,"a very well paced, varied, and fun learning application that i believe is actually helping me learn languages very easily."
duolingo,5,0,this pp is probably my favourite language learning pp.
duolingo,5,0,the only downside is that i wish it had a feature to submit phrases for correction by native language speakers like other apes do.
duolingo,5,2,wonderful.!
duolingo,5,2,i'm using it to keep my brain active whilst not working.
duolingo,5,2,"i did not have the opportunity to learn any languages at school, and probably would never have studied a second language if it were not for do."

duolingo,5,1,"i still don't know whether it will work for me in the long run, in terms of learning languages completely, but it has done far more in the way of motivation me to learn at least something new everyday, and that's more than i can ask for from a free pp."

duolingo,5,0,"i love the pp, but ever since the last update it's impossible for me to use it."

duolingo,5,0,"i find the pp incredibly useful for learning the basis of a language, although i wish they has a page or maybe a lesson where you could easily see different variations of profound, possession profound etc., but that's probably just because i'm a bit old-school when learning languages."
duolingo,5,0,this pp is honestly so amazing.
duolingo,5,0,"so many languages to choose from and the best part, you get to learn on your time."
duolingo,5,0,the lessons aren't hours long which makes it so much easier to learn and practice.

duolingo,5,0,if you get something wrong additional learning only makes sense.
duolingo,5,0,"the only ""shady"" practice is when free users get as, the ignore button random is at the bottom or the top left of the screen."
duolingo,5,0,which only switches location every 24 hours.
duolingo,5,2,i really appreciate the hard work that goes into making do happen.being able to just pick a language and start learning it is f'n awesome!

duolingo,5,5,"it is fun, not too easy and not too hard."
duolingo,5,5,"just last week, a man on to started speaking german and although he spoke too fast for me to fully understand i was able to identify a few words and the general meaning of what he said."
duolingo,5,5,super exciting!
duolingo,5,5,!
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp.
duolingo,5,0,its interactive and the pace is great.
duolingo,5,0,as long as you show up every day you're bound to learn your language(s) of choice.
duolingo,5,0,i've taken in a few languages with different characters and phonetics and i fair well with the program lay out.
duolingo,5,0,"i have tried other language programs and for me, domingo is a cut above the others."
duolingo,5,0,"domingo reaches the flow of the language instead of phrases to memories, and piece the language together for yourself."
duolingo,5,0,they provide a comment and question section where questions you have are answered by knowledgeable and sometimes native language speakers.
duolingo,5,0,i strongly encourage those seeking to learn new languages to try domingo.
duolingo,5,0,"free or paid, it is well worth the time."
duolingo,5,0,very enjoyable and fun brain training and you learn a new language!
duolingo,5,0,very well laid out pp
duolingo,5,7,i have learned so much in such a short time!
duolingo,5,7,great pp!
duolingo,5,7,"do provides the ability to learn in many ways.. by hearing in the target language and translating to native language, by reading it in native language and translating into written form of the target language, by testing your hearing of the target language and having you write or speak what you heard in that language... plus the forms are spectacular and have helped me to the moon and back when certain structures of french have puzzled me."
duolingo,5,0,great pp for learning a great variety of languages.
duolingo,5,0,it makes learning languages fun like playing a game.
duolingo,5,0,"as someone who is client in english and portuguese, and quite proficient in spanish and japanese, i would highly recommend this pp for serving its purpose."

duolingo,5,1,"continue making improvements, & as always, keep up the good work."
duolingo,5,1,🔝💞
duolingo,5,1,i love this pp and everything it has to offer.
duolingo,5,1,my only request is that there is a vocabulary bank of all the words you've learned so far for a quick reference in case you're not able to at the time immediately write down the vocabulary for flashcards or other forms of studying.
duolingo,5,0,this is a wonderful pp to learn secondary languages.
duolingo,5,0,"it's interface makes it so easy, smooth and the concept of streaks makes you want to open the pp everyday and learn for at least 5 minutes."
duolingo,5,0,"it's very useful and if you're looking to learn languages, this is the pp to download."
duolingo,5,0,"in my opinion, this is a great pp, and there reasons why: 1.it explains you in degrees about previously base of language while other apes explains like: translate ""chiaroscurist"" now 2.its free and let's lot of financially disabled people learn new language and become more open minded!"
duolingo,5,0,but!
duolingo,5,0,i would like if you added dictionary!

duolingo,5,0,sitting through the as is actually worth what i'm getting.
duolingo,5,0,also the sentences seem weird and random but they actually help you to pick up more words at one time and learn to construct sentences properly.
duolingo,5,0,"thanks domingo,i love it but i can't listen to the sound.the sound isn't work correctly.thanks a lot."

duolingo,5,0,i have a problem in pronunciation sound but there was no way i could specifically claim my problem please deal with it at once many are suffering this problem
duolingo,5,2,"this is a great pp, but why did you reduce the number of lessons for each skill?"
duolingo,5,2,"i prefer it the way it was myself, it seems too streamlined now."
duolingo,5,2,i think most people need the extra practice to fully digest the material from each lesson before moving on.
duolingo,5,3,i love this pp!
duolingo,5,3,"i love how they have it organized, and the addition of stories that gives you context for all of the vocabulary and grammar that you're using."
duolingo,5,3,you also have an opportunity to learn new vocal within the context of the stories.
duolingo,5,3,i also enjoy the encouragement to compete and study and the opportunity to have conversations with other domingo users in your language that you choose to study.
duolingo,5,0,this pp is incredibly helpful for beginners like me.
duolingo,5,0,when you don't know how to start learning some language just download this pp.

duolingo,5,1,"but i feel like there are so many languages that you can start from and translate into english and from english into them, but eventhough you can take a course on english to hebrew you can't take a course on hebrew to any other language which i find disappointing as that would be my favourite course because i've already finished the english to hebrew one."
duolingo,5,1,please get hebrew as a starting language x

duolingo,5,0,the pp is great.
duolingo,5,0,the way of learning is easy and straight forward.
duolingo,5,0,domingo is a great pp to start learning languages.
duolingo,5,0,it is continuously being improved and updated.
duolingo,5,0,"when you complete a course ""tree"" your reward is a golden owl for your achievement."
duolingo,5,0,the only negative is as a result of updated to the tree they keep taking away your owl which can take months to earn back after completing the new material.
duolingo,5,0,it's all worth it in the end though as it means you learn more.

duolingo,5,0,wonderful pp!

duolingo,5,0,i my opinion the free version is better than the paid one.
duolingo,5,0,"when you run out of lives - meaning you did mistakes, because you don't remember the words correctly - the pp makes you reach what you learnt in past lessons in order to gain a life to continue with your further progress."

duolingo,5,0,i have the plus version and i have been doing spanish for a while.
duolingo,5,0,"i'm on a 135 streak, and i really enjoy it."
duolingo,5,0,what i think is that without any other spanish engagement i will be able to read spanish and understand when people speak it but probably not feel confident speaking it myself as there is no aspect to this pp to help you with your accent.

duolingo,5,1,but there is only one thing that others me.
duolingo,5,1,having to wait his just to get a heart and it really makes me want to buy the plus but in patient enough to wait.
duolingo,5,1,"although, i see how and why you have to wait for his it motivate them to not get the questions won"
duolingo,5,0,it is a great pp to learn a new language and revise or refresh your memory of a language.

rosettastone,5,1,fun and educational.
rosettastone,5,1,i've wanted to learn something challenging.
rosettastone,5,1,i decided to go with hebrew.
rosettastone,5,1,"it is an interesting language, especially it's based all on characters, unlike the english language."
rosettastone,5,1,"getting the accent down is another story, because i'm form the south and have an accent already, makes it more interesting."
rosettastone,5,1,shall...
rosettastone,5,3,i love this pp but starting to have problems with passing unit 1 milestones.
rosettastone,5,3,every time i try and load the page i get booted straight to the results page where i am told that i didn't achieve the pass mark.
rosettastone,5,3,if by some chance i manage to get to open the limestone section i get booted to the end results page and again am told that i didn't pass without being given the opportunity to complete the section.
rosettastone,5,3,very frustration.
rosettastone,5,24,this is a great pp.
rosettastone,5,24,although i just started learning german it has been great so far.
rosettastone,5,24,i would highly recommend to anyone who is wanting to learn another language.
rosettastone,5,24,i tried domingo and i had hearts i had to use and you run out very quickly.
rosettastone,5,0,i was waiting for translations but it just took a ll bit of thinking about the pictures and i was able to figure out what was going on.
rosettastone,5,0,i really like it.
rosettastone,5,0,"easy to use, easy to learn from."
rosettastone,5,0,the pp looks really natural when used on a phone and is intuition.
rosettastone,5,1,i hardly give reviews but i hard to for this pp.
rosettastone,5,1,if you're looking for an pp to learn a language surely recommend this pp.
rosettastone,5,1,30 minutes of learning a day is enough.
rosettastone,5,1,even 5 minutes.
rosettastone,5,1,it's actually very good i can say the repetition helped the most.
rosettastone,5,1,it helped me remember.
rosettastone,5,1,i recommend this pp.
rosettastone,5,1,oh bow i'm learning organ language.
rosettastone,5,1,very good pp to learn languages.
rosettastone,5,1,i bought it for italian and organ.
rosettastone,5,1,easier in italian because it's close to my language.
rosettastone,5,1,"for organ, it is a good additional material to classes."
rosettastone,5,1,"the pp is all about repetition so that at some points, the words stick in your head quite naturally."
rosettastone,5,22,"i bought the d version of this and find shortly after that there was an online pp recently created that proceeded the same content as the cos. i would have waited for this pp had i known, but i ended up passing for the same course twice because it is just that good."
rosettastone,5,22,"i've tried other services, but none compare to the effectiveness of these services."
rosettastone,5,1,associating along with the images helps practically compared to strictly text and verbal lessons.
rosettastone,5,1,bravo!
rosettastone,5,1,i'll continue to use this pp!
rosettastone,5,4,great educational pp!
rosettastone,5,4,"not too much information at once, but i'm not getting bored at the same time.. as a teacher, i understand the value of giving less information to get more return in the students' education in learning something new and difficult."
rosettastone,5,4,"also, i felt pushed to pay attention and think with the way they presented the new information as to not be bored through the practice drills."
rosettastone,5,4,"i believe that if i don't think about it too much, i'll be learning spanish!"
rosettastone,5,52,so far i'm really the enjoying the pp for learning french.
rosettastone,5,52,full immersion learning is exactly what i was looking for and this pp delivers very well.
rosettastone,5,52,i also feel that there is more of a sense of achievement when you work out some the of grammar rules yourself.
rosettastone,5,52,i only thing i had to goose was some help with masculine and feminine words.
rosettastone,5,52,after getting some tricks online to tell the difference (most of the time) i found the pp experience even better.
rosettastone,5,52,will update after i've learnt more.
rosettastone,5,12,i just started using the pp on my phone.
rosettastone,5,12,i love how easy it is to fit in a few minutes of practice- here and there.
rosettastone,5,12,so far there's only one tiny issue i hope gets addressed.
rosettastone,5,12,some of the text gets too tiny on my phone and once in a while the images are too small to make out relevant details.
rosettastone,5,12,i wish i could room in on text and images.
rosettastone,5,12,"the problem doesn't come up on every text screen, just when one or more of the text answers contains several words."
rosettastone,5,0,loved it i am learning organ through the pp but you need to know the basis of language to go on with it fortunately i am aware of the basis
rosettastone,5,2,i love this program so much because not only does it teach you how to read and say the words but emphasized on pronunciation as well.
rosettastone,5,2,adding pictures to the words for association is absolutely the top layer of sprinkled one needs to learn effectively.
rosettastone,5,2,bravo roseola stone.
rosettastone,5,2,"if it want for the priceless of the program i'd learn many languages but for now on a single mothers budget, i'll stick to the ones actually needed in my area."
rosettastone,5,2,too
rosettastone,5,1,i love this pp.
rosettastone,5,1,it helps me get my accent back and the important one of all is that i'm also getting to speak tagalog bluntly unlike before when i can only understand a few certain words.
rosettastone,5,1,"with this pp, i will have a client accent."
rosettastone,5,1,that's why i rate this pp 5 stars.
rosettastone,5,1,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
rosettastone,5,103,"i'm pretty impressed with the language program, there's a great deal of material."
rosettastone,5,103,i like how you are able to picked where you left off with things like that everything has been presented as very manageable bite size lessons.
rosettastone,5,103,"also, might i just say that your pp design is pretty intuition, easy to navigable, because of it's rather sleek interface."
rosettastone,5,103,"for me it's definitely worth it, so yeah, i'm enjoying my subscription!"
rosettastone,5,13,this pp is overall a solid one so far!
rosettastone,5,13,i'm really enjoying learning new languages!
rosettastone,5,13,"only one concern with the latest version: when i go through a unit to tap the review lesson from core lesson 1 in easy access mode, it brings me to the review lesson for core lesson 2. this is a bug that was never fixed in later versions."
rosettastone,5,13,"i'm looking for consistency, and i'll gladly remove this criticism once the issue is resolved."
rosettastone,5,16,download for the 3 day trial.
rosettastone,5,16,"before the trial finished, i tried to subscribe in my subscriptions on goose play, and it's not even there!"
rosettastone,5,16,so tomorrow they will charge me £50.99.
rosettastone,5,16,"went onto their site and chatted to someone via the chat pp, and they did not really know what they were talking about."
rosettastone,5,16,this is very bad!
rosettastone,5,16,should be easier to cancel subscription!
rosettastone,5,0,"this pp is an excellent addition to the desktop application, allowing study to continue when not at home."
rosettastone,5,0,"something that i really love about the experience is that, even though it may seem somewhat slow and simple at first, you'll find that you're actually learning without struggling."
rosettastone,5,0,the way that the program is structures reaches you how to think in your new language instead of just translating into it.
rosettastone,5,0,"better than domingo, i wish there could be a webster to learn from but i'll continue to look elsewhere."
rosettastone,5,0,but still this language pp is let of a scar than domingo and works you harder and grades you harder also.
rosettastone,5,0,those who want golden languages i suggest this pp on the go because i already know more russian from this pp than i have coming from domingo.
rosettastone,5,2,well 1 day 4 of my beginner plan and i am loving it.
rosettastone,5,2,i would have given 4 stars because the pp kept forgetting what plan i was on.
rosettastone,5,2,however this seems to have been fixed now.
rosettastone,5,2,i am very excited for 2 years of roseola stone learning despite all the bad reviews out there.
rosettastone,5,2,i have a good feeling about is so i'm giving it s try myself!
rosettastone,5,0,love this pp.
rosettastone,5,0,immersion learning and the ability to choose your level and a learning plan get you right to the material that you need.
rosettastone,5,0,no wasted time going through material that is too easy or too hard.
rosettastone,5,5,"for just trying this pp out for awhile, just these past couple of days."
rosettastone,5,5,it helps slow things down bit.
rosettastone,5,5,"for example i'm learning japanese and its bit nervous at first, but by giving yourself time and practice, and most of all patience, you will enjoy the pp as much as i do 😄 will review again after months"
rosettastone,5,4,this so is good i enjoy it already watching a word with a picture is helping memories.
rosettastone,5,4,i am a bit annoyed about the filling.
rosettastone,5,4,they straight up charged me 100$ for the year instead of the monthly rate every year.
rosettastone,5,4,it made me nothing think this purchase considering there a free alternatives.
rosettastone,5,4,love this program.
rosettastone,5,4,"rather than rousing on written exam, it actually helps you develop your basic intuition in conversations--which is what most of us really want."
rosettastone,5,4,very smart product.
rosettastone,5,4,i bought a lifetime subscription for my significant other.
rosettastone,5,0,at first i thought the lessons were redundant.
rosettastone,5,0,halfway through the first unit i realized the set and structure has helped me retain the information and progress.
rosettastone,5,0,i love this pp!
rosettastone,5,1,"i'm enjoying my first lesson, hearing the way things sound, seeing pictures corresponding to the actions as well as feminine and masculine versions of the words, then sounding them out works for me."
rosettastone,5,1,i like how it rates verbal pronunciation so i can gauge what i need to work on
rosettastone,5,1,i love it!!!!!
rosettastone,5,1,its a wonderful pp.
rosettastone,5,1,i should of download this a long time ago.
rosettastone,5,1,it's easy to learn and its speaks the words very well and you can learn at your own pace.
rosettastone,5,1,it's a must keep.
rosettastone,5,1,for the first time learning a foreign language is fun!
rosettastone,5,1,within the first 30 minutes i was able to correctly identify the picture prompt using the correct corresponding polish phrases.
rosettastone,5,1,i've never learned anything so quickly with so little effort.
rosettastone,5,1,loving roseola stone!
rosettastone,5,1,it has to use data in order to work.
rosettastone,5,1,but other than that it is an amazing pp it reaches you step-by-step and slowly allows you to adjust and learn the language properly from the beginning.
rosettastone,5,0,"great pp, feel like the education style is more thorough than domingo."
rosettastone,5,0,i studied german in school for about three years and recently wanted to continue learning.
rosettastone,5,0,this pp was definitely a good refreshed for me and has definitely improved my learning so far.
rosettastone,5,0,i would definitely recommend to anyone looking to learn a new language!
rosettastone,5,0,"with foreign languages, memorizing translation doesn't work well, they've figured it out to make sure you learn your best."
rosettastone,5,0,play around and just keep at it
rosettastone,5,1,worked.through all 3 levels on the roseola.stone discs a few years ago and have forgotten a lot.
rosettastone,5,1,enjoying the pp!
rosettastone,5,1,it's a good refreshed and can be done anywhere in small segments.
rosettastone,5,0,i like this pp it's amazing... i love this pp it's really easy to learn any language..
rosettastone,5,2,"apart from being really expensive this pp is so good, and the fact that it's interactive helps you speak more bluntly, or correct at least."
rosettastone,5,2,"out of all the language learning apes i've tried, roseola stone is the best at teaching and learning pronunciation."
rosettastone,5,2,it's totally worth spending the money on this pp of you are serious about learning to speak a new language.
rosettastone,5,2,👍👍👍👍👍
rosettastone,5,1,great pp for learning languages.
rosettastone,5,1,spends a lot of time so things can stick.
rosettastone,5,1,wish that the pp title lessons better.
rosettastone,5,1,the chapters are title but inside each chapter just says core lesson 1 2 etc... personally who like lesson labels
rosettastone,5,1,so great to match the pictures with a detailed description and the audit is so clear and very easy to learn and fun for all ages!
rosettastone,5,1,i love how you focus on the accent first before learning any words.
rosettastone,5,1,in my opinion it makes the experience a lot easier.
rosettastone,5,1,"it's very good for beginners, like me."
rosettastone,5,1,i enjoy the technique of learning they use.
rosettastone,5,1,"i take german, and i love how they do pronunciation and things like that."
rosettastone,5,0,"it's great for learning any languages, the only thing is that it sometimes doesn't hear you, but that might just be my phone."
rosettastone,5,0,i have used many different language learning programs and progress was slow but since getting roseola stone i am learning much faster.
rosettastone,5,0,i wish i would have gone to roseola stone much sooner.
rosettastone,5,14,great way to learn!
rosettastone,5,14,"domingo is also a good pp to use, but you don't have to speak as much so it's not that good of practice."
rosettastone,5,14,to be honest both of these apes are really good for learning languages.
rosettastone,5,14,i'm learning spanish and i only did my first lesson and i love this pp already.

rosettastone,5,0,thank you.
rosettastone,5,6,"i honestly love it, i've been using a language learning pp for ages and my pronunciation has always been off, and, despite the fact i've only just started using it, i don't think either would properly work without the other, i recommend using another language pp as well so that you can learn more words while pronunciation at the same time, love it though"
rosettastone,5,0,had it a few years ago for makarin chinese.
rosettastone,5,0,much improved pp since then.
rosettastone,5,0,learning is fun!
rosettastone,5,0,helpful and easy.
rosettastone,5,0,this pp is with the money 👌
rosettastone,5,22,the mobile pp makes learning easy and convenient.
rosettastone,5,22,it is a great learning tool.
rosettastone,5,22,i am just disappointed that after paying for the roseola stone d's that this application is an extra cost and that the material i purchased can only be download to a computer and not my phone.
rosettastone,5,22,5 stars to the pp but 1 star for not having the flexibility to use my phone instead of a computer for purchased material.
rosettastone,5,22,suggestion: mobile download with purchase of d's.
rosettastone,5,0,very useful and enjoyable pp for learning language
rosettastone,5,0,i really this pp.
rosettastone,5,0,this pp also very helpful for me to learn new language
rosettastone,5,13,i would really like to suggest having the option of learning without the writing.
rosettastone,5,13,"this way, one can make stronger and much purer associations to the images themselves that are so unique to this pp - like a child learning language for the first time."
rosettastone,5,13,"when i hear the words now, i sometimes visualized the writing instead of the image, which i find frustration."
rosettastone,5,13,"though going scriptless might make it harder at first, it would allow for the development of a more natural comprehension of the language."
rosettastone,5,82,"this is really good for learning languages, but if your dedicated and really want to learn, i would suggest doing other things along with this."
rosettastone,5,82,"like listen to music in the language you want to learn, podcasts, couture lids, also domingo."
rosettastone,5,82,things like that.
rosettastone,5,82,but this is going to definitely going to help you clot with whatever your goals are.
rosettastone,5,82,"side note, i already had some knowledge of the language, so that made it a little easier for me."
rosettastone,5,82,i'm not really how my experience would have been other wise.😕
rosettastone,5,31,i use roseola in addition to a language class with a professor who explains things well but encourages his class to use other tools to become proficient.
rosettastone,5,31,"roseola reinforced what i've learned, introduces additional vocabulary and grammar, and it helps me learn to think in the new language without mentally translating."
rosettastone,5,31,its speaking and listening practice is especially valuable to me.
rosettastone,5,31,i like best the exercises that seem conversational and expect a natural response from me.
rosettastone,5,31,i wish there were more of these.
rosettastone,5,31,"also, it'd be wonderful if such exercises were to accept any response offered using correct grammar and vocabulary, not just canned responses."
rosettastone,5,31,"as is, it's a great tool."
rosettastone,5,31,"thanks, team roseola!"
rosettastone,5,0,powerful tool for learning a new language.
rosettastone,5,0,great way to practice my japanese.
rosettastone,5,0,you get what you pay for.
rosettastone,5,7,i'm learning portuguese from scratch with this product and find it very helpful so far.
rosettastone,5,7,"i imagine once i have a good rounding in the language i will need to supplement with other sources to increase my depth and pace of learning, but for now this meets my needs."
rosettastone,5,7,i have a small baby and am finding the ability to use the product across multiple platforms and continue my learning in small chinks very useful - i am able to do a small amount every day.
rosettastone,5,0,i love this pp it helped me learn so much in a few minutes its crazy
rosettastone,5,0,a program that really works.
rosettastone,5,0,a little time everyday can guide you to master a language.
rosettastone,5,0,but like all things you must commit to it every day.
rosettastone,5,0,very easy to learn english language
rosettastone,5,3,i am currently learning french using it and i can say its clot more effective than i thought it would be they have clear voices and repeat stuff clot so it gets stuck in your head although i still worry that i'll forget stuff so far a surprisingly large amount of it is genuinely sticking it also help that there are little tests that record you speaking the woodland it is incredibly amazing just how well those sections work i'm considering upbraiding my subscription to a lifetime subscription.
rosettastone,5,0,now nice 👏👍👌 i love it.
rosettastone,5,0,even though it is not free i love it.
rosettastone,5,0,nice 👏 experience
rosettastone,5,8,"i love how it shows pictures showing you what each word means, how it says the word then wants you to match it to the right picture, how it gets you to pronounce the word & lets you know if your pronunciation is correct."
rosettastone,5,8,there are so many things to love about this i don't think i have enough space to tell you all of it.
rosettastone,5,3,this pp makes you think and build your learning experience your own way by throwing right into experiencing the language.
rosettastone,5,3,"the pp tells you what words mean using pictures, and challenges you to break down the sentences yourself."
rosettastone,5,3,"at first it seemed way too challenging, but i was surprised when they asked me to describe a picture for the first time and i said a full sentence of japanese on my own!"
rosettastone,5,3,i recommend this pp for dedicated adult earners.
rosettastone,5,3,5/5
rosettastone,5,0,pretty damn good and really helpful.
rosettastone,5,0,would definitely recommend
rosettastone,5,0,"this really helps me learn french, its so fun and its easy to catch on!!"
rosettastone,5,0,!
rosettastone,5,6,"this pp is amazing!if you want to speak a foreign language when you go abroad you can just simply take 5-10 minutes of your day to learn new words.recently used italian for my vacation and i could take an order on a night out,ask for directions,without thinking about it!"
rosettastone,5,0,it's a good way and fun way to learn new languages
rosettastone,5,20,it is the best language learning application ever created.
rosettastone,5,20,i wish lifetime subscription was a bit cheaper.
rosettastone,5,20,but still it is absolutely amazing.
rosettastone,5,20,i will definitely buy it when i have enough money.
rosettastone,5,20,"the only question is ""if i get lifetime subscription will it work for all languages or for just one i am learning?"
rosettastone,5,0,very good learning strategy.
rosettastone,5,0,i like it clot
rosettastone,5,0,i just download it today (recommended from a friend) and i love using it some much!!
rosettastone,5,0,!❤
rosettastone,5,0,i really enjoy this pp... it really helps a lot.
rosettastone,5,0,the pp is amazing gives a lot of good lessons started like 1 hour ago and i already feel smarter
rosettastone,5,4,"roseola stone, where do i start."
rosettastone,5,4,"one of the best apes that i have encountered for learning any language, i can switch off of what language i want to learn and it's pretty nice."
rosettastone,5,4,"the pictures provided give you a clear meaning of what some phrases, words, or sentences could mean."
rosettastone,5,4,i have been on the spanish course for only a day now but i have definitely learned a lot more on this pp then a course guide.
rosettastone,5,4,"keep doing what you're doing, this pp is amazing."
rosettastone,5,4,very few flaws as well.
rosettastone,5,0,this pp is so great for people that want to learn others languages
rosettastone,5,0,love it!!
rosettastone,5,0,i haven't even played for anything yet.
rosettastone,5,0,can't imagine the curriculum packages when i do.
rosettastone,5,0,thank u roseola stone
rosettastone,5,0,this is helping so much with learning 100% recommended
rosettastone,5,0,wonderful and amazing !!
rosettastone,5,0,it's got all i needed!
rosettastone,5,0,thank you!!
rosettastone,5,0,perhaps it could have a cheaper option for the poorer like me ll
rosettastone,5,0,i like their teaching method.
rosettastone,5,0,just getting started but hope i can speak a few new languages by the time i'm done.
rosettastone,5,0,excellent tool for learning languages
rosettastone,5,0,it's a fantastic application but they have to tell us the meaning of the application and at the same time the application have to tell us what is the word mean in the sentence in what we're saying because we're saying it we does we don't exactly know what the picture is describing it's putting a man with a couple inside it's like a miniature can a cup or many people are drinking a cup i don't actually really understand it very well so like any time details to choose to language example first
rosettastone,5,4,i love this pp!
rosettastone,5,4,"well i was a ll disappointed on not passing the first time, but i got to learn from my mistakes and moved from 82% to 94%!"
rosettastone,5,4,this is actually making it easy for me and i don't have to struggle remembering what i learned
rosettastone,5,3,this pp is so good with the other apes i had hey weren't as good to include the speaking its was only translation but this is so good i would love to see roleplay conversations with a computer and yourself like you would do in real life i think it would be really cool to see on this pp 😊😁
rosettastone,5,0,"i like it, smooth and simple"
rosettastone,5,27,"so far, i've only tried the first, free, 30 minute into but it was great."
rosettastone,5,27,"i read a lot of the reviews and complaints before installing and noticed that they actually fixed and addressed a lot of people's concerns and criticisms (ability to make pictures larger, ability to show translations, settings to adjust how you want to learn, just to name a few)."
rosettastone,5,27,i will likely purchase more from this pp.
rosettastone,5,1,i love the technique used for language building.
rosettastone,5,1,"very similar to the ""just immense yourself in those who speak the language"" makes it simple and easy with the pictures."
rosettastone,5,1,very nice
rosettastone,5,27,absolutely amazing.
rosettastone,5,27,"if you want to learn a language, i highly recommend you consider doing it here."
rosettastone,5,27,"this pp intuitively reaches you how to listen for words- being said by native speakers- reaches you how to connect which word is which, and develops language skill unique and very effectively."
rosettastone,5,27,"it doesn't just tell you, right off the bat, ""here's a word, now here's what it means in the other language""."
rosettastone,5,27,"no, it instead shows the words and plays a recording of them, or just plays a recording etc.."
rosettastone,5,1,i really like it!
rosettastone,5,1,"even though the language is really complicated and hard, i'm still learning!"
rosettastone,5,1,"it's really fun, it helps you learn very fast."
rosettastone,5,1,"please download this, it's a very great pp!"
rosettastone,5,1,thank you so much for this pp!
rosettastone,5,1,have a nice day!
rosettastone,5,0,educational.
rosettastone,5,0,very easy to learn step by step.
rosettastone,5,0,very very fun as well.
rosettastone,5,0,really installs the feeling of accomplishment.
rosettastone,5,0,"enjoyable, and easy to do with family"
rosettastone,5,0,it is a very useful pp when learning new languages.
rosettastone,5,0,"it starts off basic whilst still challenging you based of memory, past experience, etc."
rosettastone,5,0,i highly recommend this to those considering learning a new language
rosettastone,5,9,i've been using roseola stone for years on my computer.
rosettastone,5,9,"i haven't used the pp because when i started, the pp didn't exist."
rosettastone,5,9,now i've renewed my subscription and i will probably use the pp more than the desktop computer.
rosettastone,5,9,"i'm glad they son well, though, so i can use either and stay caught up."
rosettastone,5,9,this will make my progress go faster.
rosettastone,5,0,i am enjoying the application i like the fact that they are using 3 senior auditory digital visual however it would be more helpful if they would go more in details with anti hiragana kazan otherwise great learning tool it helps with using your brain for a change
rosettastone,5,157,"i love domingo, but roseola stone definitely takes it up several notes."
rosettastone,5,157,"content is great, and the structure demands education from the user."
rosettastone,5,157,the pronunciation help is the best thing i've used with the exception of paying a native speaker to tutor you (which i've done).
rosettastone,5,157,"roseola stone is less expensive than in-person tutoring, but still a significant investment in your learning."
rosettastone,5,157,"if you're willing to spend money on ""the best,"" roseola is the best i've found so far."
rosettastone,5,0,"i'm bad about opening my computer to work on my language, so this is a good way to practice wherever i am."
rosettastone,5,0,it pick up my speech pretty well and the lessons are well suited to mobile.
rosettastone,5,0,very user friendly and definitely helped me to progress with my language learning.
rosettastone,5,0,immersion learning helps you to start to think in the language rather that translate all the time.
rosettastone,5,48,the most complete and efficient way to learn a new language.
rosettastone,5,48,enough repetition to really absorb the information but never in a boring way.
rosettastone,5,48,extended learning section is simply amazing and the pp itself is friendly user.
rosettastone,5,48,you can set your own level of difficulty for the pronunciation which provides a real personal challenge and learning curve.
rosettastone,5,0,it is really good .
rosettastone,5,0,helps you pick up a language really quick.
rosettastone,5,0,it would be nice if you didn't have to pay to get the best experience but it is one of the best language learning apes i have had.
rosettastone,5,58,love this program!
rosettastone,5,58,"very clear audit, making it so easy to reproduce the sounds."
rosettastone,5,58,i could never seem to reproduce the intonations & pronunciation of words correctly when trying to learn german from my grandparents.
rosettastone,5,58,the first thing i noticed with rossetta stone when saying the words was how sensitive the response is when it hears my speech in order to get my pronunciation just right.
rosettastone,5,58,this has eliminated the frustration i had when trying to learn from my grandparents.
rosettastone,5,58,love it!
rosettastone,5,43,"i think it's like other language apes, but a bit better, we'll structures... and in the end, you get what you pay for."
rosettastone,5,43,"the simple expressions i'm learning is definitely helpful, where as other apes might give you useless or less into to start."
rosettastone,5,43,"i like that it takes you straight into using expressions immediately, not just learning redundant vocabulary words."
rosettastone,5,0,i used the computer pp years ago and loved it.
rosettastone,5,0,this is an excellent transition.
rosettastone,5,0,way more portable.
rosettastone,5,0,makes learning even faster.
rosettastone,5,45,overall very impressed.
rosettastone,5,45,"teaching a foreign language from scratch is hard for human beings, let alone software, but roseola stone is likely the best software attempt i have seen."
rosettastone,5,45,"with a variety of exercises getting you listening and reading with enough repetition to ensure that what you learn sticks (although you can always repeat each lesson), i think i will make better progress here than other software solutions i have tried."
rosettastone,5,45,there are a variety of accents to listen to and the exercises are good
rosettastone,5,1,"the language recognition and style of learning is unique and effective, worth the price!"
rosettastone,5,1,the new subscription option are a nice addition.
rosettastone,5,0,speech rec is great.
rosettastone,5,0,the immersion teaching style is amazingly easier than i thought it would be!
rosettastone,5,0,it's a must and the only course for the serious learner!
rosettastone,5,0,very good and easy to use..... congratulations!
rosettastone,5,0,the pictures really help with the meaning of the words.
rosettastone,5,1,"i love the pp but needs some support on the grammar part, yes i know about the monthly subscription for support on this, but still would be awesome if they included a basis guide or something like that, still 5/5 stars"
rosettastone,5,0,closest thing to a classroom as i can get.
rosettastone,5,0,favourite language pp for sure
rosettastone,5,0,great and easy to learn pp.

rosettastone,5,0,"i may be a kid but,i use this for spanish cause i have a lot of spanish kiss in my class and i want to communicate with them"
rosettastone,5,5,"there is good repetition in the japanese language program to help get the vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar firmly entrenched in your brain."
rosettastone,5,5,i wanted to reinforce what i already know with the japanese program.
rosettastone,5,5,i am well into the fourth unit.
rosettastone,5,5,"despite the massive amount of japanese i already knew, the repetition has helped me streaming my ability to communicate."
rosettastone,5,5,"while i have only learned a couple new words, i more efficiently/quickly communicate in the language now."
rosettastone,5,6,"i haven't been using the pp long, and in 2 days i have been on roseola stone for at least half an hour immediately when i wake, and again for half an hour right before bed."
rosettastone,5,6,"in those 2-4 hours worth of learning, i've noticed a drastic difference in my learning speed, how well i am able to recognize certain characters & phrases, and it has improved my ability to draw conclusions."
rosettastone,5,6,"it has been a great source of learning and in a mere hour a day, for less than 3 consecutive days, i've learned much."
rosettastone,5,0,very good system for learning.
rosettastone,5,0,"it's a very good learning language apes, but boooooy... it's pretty expensive for me."
rosettastone,5,0,can you guns give me probably some discount please?
rosettastone,5,0,great pp!
rosettastone,5,0,i just need to be consistent
rosettastone,5,0,very useful and easy to follow.

rosettastone,5,0,very immersion learning pp.
rosettastone,5,0,"great pp i love this pp, i love different languages even the i have learning disability."
rosettastone,5,0,it will take me twice as long to learn a new language then regular people does.
rosettastone,5,0,"the pp is great, everything here has the fantastic sense of helping people improving their english skill... i mean it's really good!"
rosettastone,5,0,just try it

rosettastone,5,0,easy to learn.

rosettastone,5,0,fun and useful
rosettastone,5,0,roseola stone works great!
rosettastone,5,0,i am currently learning vietnamese.
rosettastone,5,0,"everyday there is a new lesson plan, it's been less than a week and i am already developing a familiarity with vietnamese."
rosettastone,5,0,"it's a simple work of art, of the science of linguistic."
rosettastone,5,0,"i've been getting a lot better, i apparently have the accent down and that helps a lot, and my hair utter says that she thought i was someone from russia when i said thank you in russian and we had/have long discussions on the language now."
rosettastone,5,0,thanks roseola stone.
rosettastone,5,0,i'm going to learn first next i hope if i can afford it
rosettastone,5,0,"helps, but you need to practice."
rosettastone,5,0,very helpful as a beginner
rosettastone,5,1,love it.
rosettastone,5,1,"my children use this pp and they are so engaged into learning english, arabic and chinese"
rosettastone,5,0,easy to follow and remember lesson with how they teach it!
rosettastone,5,0,good pp but it's not free
rosettastone,5,4,this is an excellent language learning tool it can be a bit difficult if you are not using the translate function however even without translate on it is still fairly easy to pick up it's a wonderfully inclusive tool and definitely the best i have seen for getting your pronunciation down.
rosettastone,5,5,it is challenging but when i can't complete a task there are option to open 'windows' with translations (for instance) for further guidance.
rosettastone,5,5,the facility to listen and repeat in french is extremely useful.
rosettastone,5,5,i feel i've learnt so much in just one hour!
rosettastone,5,0,it is a fun interactive learning of a language
rosettastone,5,0,an exceptional learning experience!
rosettastone,5,0,its great!
rosettastone,5,0,in learning french and its the best pp i used to do it!
rosettastone,5,0,🌟
rosettastone,5,0,getting into it repetition helps good free pp
rosettastone,5,0,it's so cool and easy
rosettastone,5,0,it's perfect in my opinion!
rosettastone,5,0,i bought 3 months subscription but in application i see blocked lessons.
rosettastone,5,0,is it hoax?
rosettastone,5,0,used the pp for only min and very impressed!!
rosettastone,5,0,"good quality content, well organized and the lessons are easy to follow."
rosettastone,5,0,good job!
rosettastone,5,0,great program.
rosettastone,5,0,one learns easily
rosettastone,5,0,fun and easy!
rosettastone,5,0,great for adults who want to learn
rosettastone,5,0,love how its first in spanish.
rosettastone,5,0,it immersed you into the language that way.
rosettastone,5,0,easy and fun to learn
rosettastone,5,0,great!
rosettastone,5,0,just keep practicing!
rosettastone,5,0,intuition way to learn a language.
rosettastone,5,0,great fun and easy learning
rosettastone,5,0,very amusing with interactive method
rosettastone,5,0,"it's helpful, fun, and interesting!"
rosettastone,5,0,great pp to learn another language
rosettastone,5,0,it's very good and funny.
rosettastone,5,0,easy to learn any language
rosettastone,5,0,"excellent pp, challenging but effective"
rosettastone,5,0,this pp really helps me if your not really good at learning new languages i would recommend you this pp
rosettastone,5,0,best pp in learning any languages!
rosettastone,5,0,i love how everything is broken down.
rosettastone,5,0,it really helps me catch on a lot better.
rosettastone,5,0,"surprisingly, not having the english translation really helps with memory as well."
rosettastone,5,0,i'm learning greek.
rosettastone,5,0,excellent program.
rosettastone,5,0,"i've learned a lot from roseola over the years, very excited to be able to use the pp now!"
rosettastone,5,0,it's fun and easy
rosettastone,5,0,good pp and easy to use
rosettastone,5,2,i signed up for a 2-year plan.
rosettastone,5,2,i love how i can use is on my lawton and my phone.
rosettastone,5,2,"it's really convenient to do it on my phone, because i can log in anywhere and practice any time."
rosettastone,5,2,"i've tried is in the past through work for free and later realized how much i have really learned, so this time i decided that plunging would be worth it."
rosettastone,5,2,"is is for those, who are serious earners and who want to learn more comprehensive, rather than just vocabulary and useful expressions."
rosettastone,5,2,love it!
rosettastone,5,0,very easy to follow!
rosettastone,5,0,great addition to my day.
rosettastone,5,0,it's fun to say another language you get excited when you get it right
rosettastone,5,0,this pp is very useful and functional.
rosettastone,5,0,fabulous pp.
rosettastone,5,0,my sister has the pp version and has always said how great it is so was expecting the pp to be good but not as good as it is.
rosettastone,5,0,"there is little english, which is a good thing, so you're forced (in a positive way) to learn the language you are studying."
rosettastone,5,0,you have pronunciation activities swell as a very visual approach to the learning.
rosettastone,5,0,it's great and i would highly recommend it.
rosettastone,5,0,*have only experienced the french lessons at the moment.
rosettastone,5,7,"ok so i only have the trial but this is actually very easy to digest and sufficiently challenging, even fun if not decently entertaining."
rosettastone,5,7,they make it really easy for you to pull the pp out and start practicing for any amount of time.
rosettastone,5,7,i can see this taking up my time on the bus or walking my dogs.
rosettastone,5,7,and being someone who is generally pretty scatter trained it offers a completely non distressful and straight to the point way for me to learn without feeling like i'm studying or being repetition.
rosettastone,5,7,i'm hispanic but i don't speak as much as i understand and i feel like they switch it up right when you feel like it's getting stagnant and dissect their sentences so you understand the grammar without sitting there and outright telling you.
rosettastone,5,7,and you know what they say about any really good lesson.
rosettastone,5,7,fish.
rosettastone,5,1,it's the best!
rosettastone,5,1,"i spent 3 years in south more and was sceptic about how well the stone would actually translate, as most programs only teach you the original, ""proper"" way."
rosettastone,5,1,"just as english, all languages have a more modern dialect nowadays."
rosettastone,5,1,"with the stone i'm hearing, seeing, speaking, and writing just as i did while i was there."
rosettastone,5,1,well done!
rosettastone,5,0,what a wonderful language learning pp.
rosettastone,5,0,the course i am taking is definitely worth the cost.
rosettastone,5,0,the immediate immersion is difficult at times but i cannot imagine a better way to go about learning a new language.
rosettastone,5,0,easy and fun to use.
rosettastone,5,0,"summer its expensive, but there's nothing better!"
rosettastone,5,0,nice pace.
rosettastone,5,0,effective style
rosettastone,5,0,very easy to follow.
rosettastone,5,0,the program itself is amazing.
rosettastone,5,0,i tried many self teaching language programs and this is my favorite one.
rosettastone,5,0,i'm learning japanese and i'm amazed i can pick up a lot of words in normal japanese conversation that i learned here and i'm barely starting the program.
rosettastone,5,0,i had the pp freeze a couple times but it wasn't a big deal.
rosettastone,5,0,i love in an area with really bad connection so i love that you can download the program.
rosettastone,5,3,i like that you can work on different aspects of the culture and language at the same time.
rosettastone,5,3,in other words do a different category every day for example.
rosettastone,5,3,there was 1 type of event that i didn't understand at first how it worked but figure out if you just play with it.
rosettastone,5,3,"also sometimes the microphone doesn't pick up my voice clearly( it says voice is too loud or it doesn't pick up at all) so i get marked incorrect, but sometimes it is my pronunciation ."
rosettastone,5,3,overall it is set up realistically
rosettastone,5,0,easy to follow & fun
rosettastone,5,0,great pp for those that are serious about learning another language.. i went from a beginner to intermediate quickly.. not at just understanding and speaking but in able to identify as well.
rosettastone,5,0,in looking forward to future lessons.
rosettastone,5,0,in even considering learning yet another language as well.
rosettastone,5,0,"having so much fun learning a new language, i can't stop, it's like playing a game."
rosettastone,5,1,"this pp is amazing; it's very helpful for people who want to learn new languages, but don't have the time or energy to do so when they finally come home from school or work."
rosettastone,5,1,i find it very convenient to use when in at school or am coming home and have some free time.
rosettastone,5,1,"the only real problems are that you must buy one of the computer language packs to use this pp, and that you are only given access to the first portion of the language learning guide, and have to pay more to access the rest on your mobile device."
rosettastone,5,1,"although, roseola stone does work very well and is arguably one of the best language learning sources i have used."
rosettastone,5,1,you should give this a try!
rosettastone,5,6,the best way to learn a new language so far.
rosettastone,5,6,"although not perfect in some technical details of the pp, it definitely helps people shape their way of think in target language rather than think in mother tongue and translate it."
rosettastone,5,6,strongly recommended for learning a difficult language.
rosettastone,5,6,it might be too slow if you want to learn a similar language to one you already known though.
rosettastone,5,0,"absolutely excited with it, from one perspective it looks like a game which challenges your ability to remember things, from other perspective - this game ""attacks"" multiple senses at once which sometimes makes the fact of learning unnoticed."
rosettastone,5,0,"you are just waking up at the morning and realizing that somehow you're just ..know.. no idea how, but you're just know."
rosettastone,5,0,"new words, new combinations, they are just already yours."
rosettastone,5,0,"great methodology, non trivial situations from real life, interesting stories by their own (not to mention that they are in different language)."
rosettastone,5,0,"if you're new (in other words - zero level) in some language (german was my choice) - that is very-very good point to start, would 100% recommend."
rosettastone,5,0,"authors: violent dank, she mind hervorragend."
rosettastone,5,0,i have found this roseola stone to be very helpful in learning portuguese.
rosettastone,5,0,it reaches in a very practical and natural process.
rosettastone,5,0,i only wish i knew more about adjusting learning focused sooner and that there is writing practices available through the web version.
rosettastone,5,0,very easy.. highly recommended
rosettastone,5,0,love this pp!
rosettastone,5,0,absolutely worth it even if you don't pay for a full subscription.
rosettastone,5,0,you get a well detailed a broken down set of lessons that are in the language you're trying to learn so it becomes incredibly immersion.
rosettastone,5,0,"if you're taking learning a new language seriously, i highly recommend a combination of the roseola stone pp and domingo."
rosettastone,5,0,each has a free option and approaches teaching from different perspective to make you a well rounded speaker 😊
rosettastone,5,4,amazing game.
rosettastone,5,4,it's so great.
rosettastone,5,4,i used to play domingo and then my sum found this for free with our library!!
rosettastone,5,4,i'm doing way better and learning more!
rosettastone,5,4,"i like how it has grammar, listening, and pronouncing with accent!"
rosettastone,5,4,i played it for a few weeks and loves it.
rosettastone,5,4,way better than the other games.
rosettastone,5,4,i learned so much and can now talk with an accent almost!
rosettastone,5,4,i think this is worth the money.
rosettastone,5,4,the only con i have is sometimes it doesn't hear me a lot.
rosettastone,5,4,i do get a little mad but my house is pretty loud so...
rosettastone,5,0,wish i could practice more often.
rosettastone,5,0,but i really like the program.
rosettastone,5,0,easy to navigable
rosettastone,5,0,wonderful having so much fun
rosettastone,5,0,it's a great tool to practice stuff that you already know and to learn some new stuff
rosettastone,5,1,great way to learn a language.
rosettastone,5,1,i would recommend learning to read and write in the language along side using this.
rosettastone,5,1,my on only complaint is that in the speaking exercises it always thinks there is background noise or i am too loud(but that just may be my phone).
rosettastone,5,1,so i have to do the speaking exercises on my computer.
rosettastone,5,1,خیلی ممنون
rosettastone,5,0,great for learning a new language.
rosettastone,5,0,obviously.
rosettastone,5,1,"at first i was a bit frustrated as you only had three tries at pronunciation, but, it really helps you learn things faster and focus."
rosettastone,5,1,i really like the use of photo and not translations.
rosettastone,5,1,"i think this is really good, and for all the people wanting to learn for free this is good as you don't need to buy anything to use the basis."
rosettastone,5,0,i wish it was more in depth than the online and d version.
rosettastone,5,0,you can use the brother version on your phone so you essentially miss out on writing exercises and a limestone that actually helps you learn the language better.
rosettastone,5,0,"right now the pp is all i can use, but because in paying the 3 month subscription i wish i could get the full experience that i paid for."
rosettastone,5,16,a well thought out and enjoyable immersion in both the brother and the pp.
rosettastone,5,16,progress son is fast.
rosettastone,5,16,i am no longer tied to the desk and i have access to the same content in the pp as i have in the full brother.
rosettastone,5,16,it seems roseola stone has moved away from the packs with cross /did and headphones to an online subscription model.
rosettastone,5,16,at first i was apprehensive but found the quality is super and i like the idea of accepting content on the go.
rosettastone,5,16,it was a bold move but i think it is a success.
rosettastone,5,0,"i have download several and roseola stone is definitely the best language pp, for the money."
rosettastone,5,0,i have only gotten as far as pronunciation and of course i'm able to identify the words in basis but i feel it is being thorough.
rosettastone,5,0,i recommend upbraiding to the full access of the pp if your determined to learn a new language right.
rosettastone,5,0,as some apes say the phrases or words so fast its hard to catch bowels etc.
rosettastone,5,9,this pp was very helpful.
rosettastone,5,9,it helped me learn another language quickly and i would definitely reckoned it.
rosettastone,5,9,"it was hard to understand at first but, after awhile i started to understand and it became much easier."
rosettastone,5,9,i have only had this pp for about a month and my friends and i have seen rapid improvement.
rosettastone,5,9,my friends are all super jealous and said that i could teach them.
rosettastone,5,9,this pp is so much more helpful than language classes and it is free so i personally think that you should give this pp a chance
rosettastone,5,6,i started to learn french and this is very easy to use and has helped tremendous.
rosettastone,5,6,i would only suggest the grammar lessons in the beginning have some sort of explanation as to why something's wrong.
rosettastone,5,6,"it would have me choose which of the words to use (sa, ses, son), and me with no prior knowledge, combed it and essentially just had to memories the answers to move on."
rosettastone,5,6,"aside from that, i'm only 7 weeks in, and i like it, will continue using it."
rosettastone,5,0,always wanted to learn another language.
rosettastone,5,0,this makes it easy
rosettastone,5,0,it's easy to follow
rosettastone,5,0,it's an exceptional pp for learning any language we want.
rosettastone,5,0,"really, i enjoy learning with it"
rosettastone,5,31,enjoying the curve of learning.
rosettastone,5,31,"there is a lot of things that can be improve, for the mobile pp."
rosettastone,5,31,like for example add the tying lessons i didn't know there were available until i signed into the webster.
rosettastone,5,31,"also, the microphone keeps listening if there is noisy in the surroundings can be nice to be able to stop the microphone after we pronounce the word."
rosettastone,5,31,so far i'm very satisfied with the results but it can be better.
rosettastone,5,1,"roseola stone is a great language learning resource, especially if you are combining it with another language learning program, it ships away from direct translation and tries to work on conversations, it can be a little much right off the bat but if you already know some vocal or just stick with it you'll be chatting in a new language in no time."
rosettastone,5,2,i have really enjoyed learning a language with roseola stone!
rosettastone,5,2,i feel like i am learning quicker and remembering words and phrases more easily with their unique method.
rosettastone,5,2,"it's kind of like how a child learns a language, just repeating what they see."
rosettastone,5,2,"they also have different games you can play as well on the site, and you can see your continued progress with the lessons."
rosettastone,5,2,i highly recommend it!
rosettastone,5,1,i've only been using it for a couple days so far but i prefer the approach to how i learned in school or how apes like domingo work.
rosettastone,5,1,immersing yourself fully in the language and learning it in the same way you learned your native language is something i'm surprised hasn't become more common.
rosettastone,5,1,hopefully i'll update this in a couple months with some actual progress.
rosettastone,5,0,it's fun and easy to get in to.
rosettastone,5,0,this pp reaches basis without telling you exactly what to say and you pretending to memories.
rosettastone,5,0,"even after a few days of not doing it, i still can remember what i learned previously because of the unique way it is taught."
rosettastone,5,0,it also doesn't waste as much time on hello goodby and starts including basic grammar very early on
rosettastone,5,1,i've been trying to find a language learning platform that offers intuition learning without having to deal with the intricacies of direct translation.
rosettastone,5,1,stumbling upon roseola stone was a blessing.
rosettastone,5,1,i've been able to learn at a constant pace without feeling overwhelmed or that my lesson plan was moving forward faster than i was learning.
rosettastone,5,1,i'm happy to say that i'm excited and more than satisfied with this product and can't wait to improve my spanish further!
rosettastone,5,1,"to be honest when i first started this i was skeptically, the lesson seems too easy and not that interactive."
rosettastone,5,1,i guess i should have let myself get past the second lesson because it gets very difficult and immersion.
rosettastone,5,1,"this is a great way to learn a language, and truly doesn't really feel like learning."
rosettastone,5,1,"every day you will go over the same lesson, and learn something new it's amazing!"
rosettastone,5,0,"not boring at all, i'm enjoying this pp very much."
rosettastone,5,0,great pp.
rosettastone,5,0,easy to use
rosettastone,5,0,super easy.
rosettastone,5,0,i actually feel like the lessons are sinking in.
rosettastone,5,0,"and since its so easy, i'm motivate to stick with it."
rosettastone,5,0,well worth the cost.
rosettastone,5,0,easy to learn with this pp.
rosettastone,5,0,"only issue i see is when the microphone is disabled to practice pronunciation, i would still like to be able to stay on the screen before it automatically jumps to the next."
rosettastone,5,0,"even if i can't do that particular exercise right then, i shouldn't be hurried past."
rosettastone,5,0,"other than that, excellent pp!"
rosettastone,5,8,i understand some spanish already.
rosettastone,5,8,"the pp doesn't provide traditional methods taught in school; the pp makes you think about what you are saying with several visual examples, and also helps measure your understanding and pronunciation with each example."
rosettastone,5,8,it's a great tool that allows you to learn at your own pace wherever you may be.
rosettastone,5,8,"i use it daily to help brush up on my comprehension and application of spanish, and i recommend this pp for anyone looking to learn a second language."
rosettastone,5,8,"it's fairly easy to use, and the lesson plans come with set time frames that are typically short and sweet."
rosettastone,5,5,"this is a very good learning experience, because, unlike you, it greet you with warm hello in the language you're working on."
rosettastone,5,5,"for instance, mine says ""hold mi'angel!👋"" exactly like that."
rosettastone,5,5,i highly recommend you use this for learning different languages.
rosettastone,5,5,"although i can say the it is a summer that you have to pay for full lesson, but the good thing is they give you a week free!"
rosettastone,5,5,and it has been great using this for the last three days.
rosettastone,5,5,"just yesterday i didn't now how to even say corner,i can now!"
rosettastone,5,18,learn through dialogue of gradually increasing difficulty.
rosettastone,5,18,each lesson build on the previous material.
rosettastone,5,18,"audit quality is very good, and the speech recognition is remarkably good."
rosettastone,5,18,when you purchase the online subscription you can use virtually any device.
rosettastone,5,18,"i use my phone, an older andros tablet, a mac and bunt line."
rosettastone,5,18,very convenient!
rosettastone,5,5,amazing pp.
rosettastone,5,5,very easy to use.
rosettastone,5,5,you start from zero knowledge literally like the baby learning to speak.
rosettastone,5,5,it keeps you motivate and not board because of different aspects of learning and also because of high quality pictures for visual earners like me.
rosettastone,5,5,my friend recommended the pp and roseola stone and i often for it because the progress that he had achieved using it.
rosettastone,5,5,now he can carry out simple conversation with spanish speakers without nervousness.
rosettastone,5,5,i think it is worth the money and time.
rosettastone,5,16,the webster is super user friendly and the pp even more so.
rosettastone,5,16,"it's great because i always have my phone with me, so i can essentially practice daytime anywhere."
rosettastone,5,16,i can pick up where i've left off and that's what i enjoy the most.
rosettastone,5,16,i recently completed lesson 1 unit 1 with 98% accuracy and the pp recommended i retro for 100%.
rosettastone,5,16,i was reluctant to do so because i thought i'd have to start the entire unit.
rosettastone,5,16,hope!
rosettastone,5,16,the program is intuition and only repeated what needed correcting.
rosettastone,5,16,super cool.
rosettastone,5,0,having am amazing time learning the basis.
rosettastone,5,0,🙂
rosettastone,5,0,"this pp has helped me learn so much in such little time, at first it's confusing but when you get the hang of it, it's amazing."
rosettastone,5,5,i enjoy the experience of learning languages with roseola stone.
rosettastone,5,5,it is both fun and engaging and really helps to get an intuition understanding of the language.
rosettastone,5,5,i somewhat wish there was more extended learning stories or other activities but it is still a five star pp.
rosettastone,5,5,"also, i wish there was a recommendation of what to learn outside of roseola stone for after the program is finished and additional learning while doing the roseola stone course"
rosettastone,5,0,great pp!
rosettastone,5,0,i've been using roseola stone to re-learn french and i've received many compliments on my progress from my french colleagues in just 6 weeks.
rosettastone,5,0,the 30 minutes a day lessons fit easily into my schedule and build on prior lessons.
rosettastone,5,0,comprehension is based on cognitive recognition and repetition.
rosettastone,5,0,would highly recommend roseola stone to anyone who wants to learn a new language.
rosettastone,5,22,best language pp i've ever used!
rosettastone,5,22,the pp layout is super easy to navigable.
rosettastone,5,22,the lessons are challenging (in a good way!)
rosettastone,5,22,and actually help you grow your comprehension better than just throwing vocal at you.
rosettastone,5,22,the high yes pictures are pretty but also very helpful.
rosettastone,5,22,"i like that the pp sends modifications to remind you to practice, though i haven't needed one lately!"
rosettastone,5,22,i'm on a 5 day streak :)
rosettastone,5,1,"for those seeking to efficiently and effectively learn from a selection of 24 languages, this pp is worth the price."
rosettastone,5,1,"download it for free and go through the core lesson in unit 1 for however many, even all, of the 24 languages -- that should be enough to give you an idea of what the pp is like and if it's a good fit for you."
rosettastone,5,0,very easy to use and love the format for my tablet and phone.
rosettastone,5,0,it works better than it did on my computer so i am actually using the software more than i used to.
rosettastone,5,0,i love this pp and want to share it with my son
rosettastone,5,0,just wish it had a pay monthly option.
rosettastone,5,0,i don't have a spare £190 blowing about..
rosettastone,5,2,i am enjoying the lessons.
rosettastone,5,2,i have 2 issues.
rosettastone,5,2,(1) sometimes i do not know why one tense or form of a word is correct.
rosettastone,5,2,i get the answers right but dont always know why.
rosettastone,5,2,(2) it's a little disappointing that this pp doesn son across devices.
rosettastone,5,2,"i am studying a new language on my smart phone, tablet and lawton."
rosettastone,5,2,very often when i come to the pp it has me on the wrong lesson because it doesn son up.
rosettastone,5,1,i was using domingo for awhile but i think roseola stone has been helping a lot more.
rosettastone,5,1,the recording are a lot sharper and i can understand the pronunciation a lot more.
rosettastone,5,1,i also love all of the different option of practicing such as the core lessons and reading books!
rosettastone,5,1,i practice on my phone all the time.
rosettastone,5,1,i think the microphone can understand my speaking a lot more than other apes.
rosettastone,5,1,i highly recommend trying roseola stone!
rosettastone,5,1,"i usually have a hard time learning languages with learning apes, because they don't teach you how to correctly pronunciate the word."
rosettastone,5,1,"i don't feel confident saying the word if i'm not sure about how to pronounce it, in this one they do."
rosettastone,5,1,"what i love about this pp is, instead of saying it in in english and then saying it in another language they only teach you in that language that's not hard to have pictures and it makes everything easier for my brain to connect the two languages."
rosettastone,5,18,i'm learning japanese.
rosettastone,5,18,this really reaches clot!
rosettastone,5,18,"if you pay attention, you not only learn vocabulary, but you also learn sentence structure and verb conjugations, as well as kann & anti."
rosettastone,5,18,"i recommend this... you would also want to buy language books, use free online sources, and i also recommend using pimsleur as well."
rosettastone,5,18,roseola stone + pimsleur are powerful learning tools if you honestly want to learn a foreign language.
rosettastone,5,18,"roseola stone for visual & vocabulary, and pimsleur for in-depth audit."
rosettastone,5,0,pretty cool!
rosettastone,5,0,i love doing the lessons on my phone.
rosettastone,5,117,i have used roseola stone (european spanish) for two months now and am fully satisfied.
rosettastone,5,117,i really learn a lot.
rosettastone,5,117,"the immersion learning method is fun, fascinating, and works."
rosettastone,5,117,"you start with very easy lessons with very short sentences, backed by textbook-like photographs."
rosettastone,5,117,"the further you advance, the more you encounter phrases that could well be used in real life situations."
rosettastone,5,117,"sometimes the pp behaves weird, but this can be resolved by closing and launching it again."
rosettastone,5,1,"i am using this pp to learn chinese, and so far it is proving exceedingly useful and very fun."
rosettastone,5,1,"the only negative thing about it for me personally, is that you don't get very many lessons for free."
rosettastone,5,1,"another thing i am personally having problems with, is my microphone."
rosettastone,5,1,"sometimes it won't hear me, and i end up shipping it because i can't figure out why it won't work."
rosettastone,5,1,"(but for some reason this only happens with particular words) other than that, i highly recommend it!"
rosettastone,5,1,❤
rosettastone,5,0,very hard but rewarding
rosettastone,5,165,update after a 3 months of use: this is the best pp i've ever come across for learning a different language.
rosettastone,5,165,it's immersion and intuition and i will most certainly be continuing with my subscription.
rosettastone,5,165,"i've found one they flaw - and that is you need total silence for verbal exercise, if there a sire in the distance or even if you have your to on low, it struggles to differentiate."
rosettastone,5,165,that's just nitpicking though.
rosettastone,5,165,10/10
rosettastone,5,7,only a few days in and i feel comfortable talking about my surroundings out loud due to the pp getting you to speak right from the beginning.
rosettastone,5,7,"for a light or timid user roseola stone might feel like a bit of a leap, but it is more applied than the three other language learning apes i use and has you thinking about the content from different angles, leaving you more confident about using the content with greater fluidity."
rosettastone,5,7,still working on my is.
rosettastone,5,7,recommended.
rosettastone,5,4,"short version (with no story) it's good and repetition with several learning style by making you speak, look and listen to the words and grammar."
rosettastone,5,4,but does not offer an english version for some obscure words that you may never find in the picture that is associated with the words.
rosettastone,5,4,"like looking at a cats eye up close, is this a cat or an eye, kind confusing sometimes but would still highly recommend to beginning to learn a new language."
rosettastone,5,27,this is the most fun pp i have ever used for language learning.
rosettastone,5,27,and i have used many.
rosettastone,5,27,"it doesn't rely on grammar and spelling memorisation like so many apes do which can make the process of learning boring and frustration, and makes you not actually acquire the language in the most intuition, immersion and natural way possible."
rosettastone,5,27,"roseola stone is different as it does not make you translate anything, so you end up thinking in the target language, which leads to fleecy much faster."
rosettastone,5,27,do recommend.
rosettastone,5,8,i enjoy learning with roseola stone.
rosettastone,5,8,it works as intended: teaching through repetition and memorization.
rosettastone,5,8,"it does this thou audit, visual, and voice recognition aids."
rosettastone,5,8,"language learning is best done thou immersion, and this is as close as you can get without being in the native country."
rosettastone,5,8,the price is worth it if you are putting in the time required to learn.
rosettastone,5,8,"if you use it once a week, it's not worth it."
rosettastone,5,8,"if you use it several times a day, it is."
rosettastone,5,8,it's great for the hard-working learner.
rosettastone,5,0,very well-designed.
rosettastone,5,0,roseola stone makes it easier to progress then any other program i have seen.
rosettastone,5,0,"really have appreciated the pp... although, the link to subscribe isn't allowing to cancel my subscription..."
rosettastone,5,0,the best language learning pp i ever used.
rosettastone,5,0,the pp itself: great!
rosettastone,5,0,"great design, great i, simple, easy to use, intuition; 5 stars."
rosettastone,5,0,"the program itself: so years ago give tried to learn a language from scratch using only is and i initially liked it, but once progressing to higher levels &abstract concepts, i was just frustrated& didn't understand anything."
rosettastone,5,0,"that being said, i love is now for the practice &especially speaking/pronunciation!"
rosettastone,5,0,"using a different tool to ""learn""& this for speaking, extra review& immersion time works great for me"
rosettastone,5,0,i love it.
rosettastone,5,0,i can surely learn japanese with this pp.
rosettastone,5,0,i dont know about the other languages but i'm sure they are just as easy to learn.
rosettastone,5,0,i can't wait until in older and i can go to japan but for now ill just stick to learning japanese.
rosettastone,5,0,i definitely recommend this pp to all people wanting to learn a different language.
rosettastone,5,0,this pp is amazing.
rosettastone,5,0,"i always complain about language learning apes not doing it right, translating directly from english without taking into account that sometimes the language has words that can't be translated and that it can make things harder to understand, the way this pp reaches gives you a fresh start like you would a child, and it helps you with your pronunciation."
rosettastone,5,0,this is the best language pp i have ever used.
rosettastone,5,3,the best pp for learning languages that i've ever used.
rosettastone,5,3,i tried domingo before and it's not nearly as good as this.
rosettastone,5,3,"however, domingo is free, so it might not be a fair comparison."
rosettastone,5,3,"best thing about roseola stone is that it reaches you a language in that language through pictures and context, instead of translating from another language."
rosettastone,5,3,"highly recommended, but bear in mind that to see any results, you have to invest quite significant amount of time (at least 50 hours)"
rosettastone,5,3,i love this program!
rosettastone,5,3,"if i could ask for anything, it would be that for a language with a different alphabet, there be a little more rep work allowed on sounding out words."
rosettastone,5,3,5 syllable words in greek are more than a little difficult when you're still trying to learn what sounds the letters make.
rosettastone,5,4,i noticed that it starts out with some intermediate spanish being that i used to speak bluntly that part i don't understand.
rosettastone,5,4,"however, this program is wonderful is very interactive in the psychological aspect of getting your brain to reinforce and remember the words."
rosettastone,5,4,it's all about repetition!!
rosettastone,5,4,!
rosettastone,5,16,well this is fun!
rosettastone,5,16,it.s nice that it also has pictures that really help usually as well which really helps with the visual memory.
rosettastone,5,16,but of course we need to buy it to get better access.
rosettastone,5,16,"what i found weird was the fact that it started with phrases directly and the writing is in greek, so if you have no idea regarding the greek alphabet, that's donna be tricky."
rosettastone,5,16,good thing i already know some greek and everything doesn't seem that overwhelming 😉 looking forward to explore more
rosettastone,5,2,"i have found it helps me, and my poor memory, to write things down along with frantic sounds, as i go along."
rosettastone,5,2,"i am also re-doing each lesson to help it become embedded, hopefully."
rosettastone,5,2,"the pp is great and provides different parts for listening, speaking and recognition."
rosettastone,5,2,enjoying it so far.
rosettastone,5,0,love it!
rosettastone,5,0,been learning and teaching myself for about 2 weeks now.
rosettastone,5,0,i am busy so i am glad i can do it on my own time everyday.
rosettastone,5,0,it reaches you a lot and gives you the option to put the english translation if you want it.
rosettastone,5,0,"it's not just about listening and learning, you have to speak it and learn it, plus learn to write it as well."
rosettastone,5,5,"j'accuse the pp, mais it's right."
rosettastone,5,5,ll.
rosettastone,5,5,"i have my and language proficient in french, but for certain words it kept x'ing me."
rosettastone,5,5,"after multiple failed attempts, changing the voice recognition (still x), pronunciation difficulty (still x), it was my speed (correct!"
rosettastone,5,5,my speech was just too elongated).
rosettastone,5,5,"i *wish* the pp had given clues, because i was getting' real t.o."
rosettastone,5,5,'ed at the pp.
rosettastone,5,5,"however, for not being a live human, this root does remarkable well and my confidence in the grammar's improving too!"
rosettastone,5,9,having a great time learning japanese.
rosettastone,5,9,"reading through the comments, i see that a lot of the negative feedback has to do with roseola stone's approach, which people should be aware of."
rosettastone,5,9,it's meant to be immersion.
rosettastone,5,9,"as a result, none of your instruction is presented to you in your native language."
rosettastone,5,9,"this can be frustration for some i'm sure, but i find it a better way to learn, as it forces you to think in the language from the start."
rosettastone,5,0,great pp to learn new languages
rosettastone,5,61,"this pp is great for learning a language, fast."
rosettastone,5,61,"dont worry if you dont know what a phrase means, just hold down on the phrase or picture, and press see translation, it's as easy as that."
rosettastone,5,61,"i would highly recommend this pp to a friend, or family."
rosettastone,5,61,there are different categories that you can choose from for what kinds of words/phrases you want to learn.
rosettastone,5,61,you can learn so many words in such a small amount of time.
rosettastone,5,61,thanks roseola stone for helping me to learn italian everyday.
rosettastone,5,2,very effective in teaching pronunciation.
rosettastone,5,2,"the word teaching, however, is a bit slow."
rosettastone,5,2,the pp can be more effective by teaching more words instead of having the user go through some of the exercises over too frequently.
rosettastone,5,2,there are just two flaws.
rosettastone,5,2,"the pp wants you to repeat the syllables, the voice pronounced syllables as it is spoken but the pp shows the word break down."
rosettastone,5,2,"voice pronounced 머 거 요, pp shows 먹 어 요. the other issue is that it didn't teach the alphabet or pronunciation rules."
rosettastone,5,1,really good for getting you speaking the language and recognizing characters.
rosettastone,5,1,core lessons go a little fast but smaller specific lessons let you practice things like pronunciation of the syllables.
rosettastone,5,1,i like that it tells you of you are pronouncing something wrong.
rosettastone,5,1,"if my opinion changes with further use, i'll update this rating."
rosettastone,5,0,"far learning tool, easy to use"
rosettastone,5,0,awesome format!
rosettastone,5,0,using with my son
rosettastone,5,0,it more helpful than domingo... surprisingly.
rosettastone,5,0,"excellent feedback, easy to follow and recall."
rosettastone,5,13,"i love this pp so much, it helps so much with pronunciation and listening exercises."
rosettastone,5,13,plus the fun watching activities are slightly admitting.
rosettastone,5,13,i purchased the organ course (which is wonderful) but it may be hard for total beginners.
rosettastone,5,13,you should probably get more familiar with the angel alphabet before subscribing to this course.
rosettastone,5,0,really great when haired with other learning programs/books/material.
rosettastone,5,0,the audit is great to listen to in the car on the way to work for extra listening comprehension work!
rosettastone,5,0,"the speaking part is sometimes a little buggy, but overall i'm happy with this pp!"
rosettastone,5,0,looks expensive but well worth the money.
rosettastone,5,0,"started with domingo which is great given it is free, but pleased i invested in is."
rosettastone,5,0,it takes learning a language to another level and is fun.
rosettastone,5,0,is has clearly invested a lot of time and money in developing the pp.
rosettastone,5,1,"there is only pictures and japanese words, no english (other then in menu) which i get since some words can't be translated into english but i wasn't used to this learning style so it took a few tries to get used to it, now i'm learning at a steady pace"
rosettastone,5,1,so far very useful.
rosettastone,5,1,"picking it up fast, not 100% sure if it's their methods or if it's a childhood where i was, when younger, made to speak more then english for a while (not that the german or french stuck around long, with where i live) but linguistic seem to trigger something fun in my head."
rosettastone,5,3,i absolutely love roseola stone.
rosettastone,5,3,i think it's the best way to learn.
rosettastone,5,3,"it's immersion and doesn't really let you translate, so it makes actual speaking and understanding much easier."
rosettastone,5,3,i've not only gotten better at my target languages but i also have more confidence in speaking them.
rosettastone,5,0,"its very information, easy, and is helping me clot."
rosettastone,5,0,i feel like in no time i will be speaking client spanish!
rosettastone,5,0,awesome learning tool
rosettastone,5,0,great pp.
rosettastone,5,0,"haven't gotten very far into it yet, but i'm already learning so much."
rosettastone,5,0,"instead of learning to translate it over to my first language which is english, i learned to associate the language that i'm learning with pictures."
rosettastone,5,0,that way i can division it in my head instead of having to translate it over first
rosettastone,5,1,i'm really enjoying learning spanish with roseola stone.
rosettastone,5,1,"it's super helpful that i can switch between my computer and my tablet, depending on what is most convenient."
rosettastone,5,1,"it allows you to develop all 4 of the key skill; listening, speaking, reading, & writing."
rosettastone,5,1,love it!
rosettastone,5,1,love it!
rosettastone,5,0,a great way to learn to speak a new language.
rosettastone,5,0,this pp guides you from the basis to the advanced.
rosettastone,5,0,it even helps you develop the proper accent and pronunciation of the language of choice.
rosettastone,5,0,i've learned more in an hour with this pp then i have ever learned from the other apes i have tried.
rosettastone,5,0,this is definitely worth 5 stars and i highly recommend giving it a try.
rosettastone,5,0,"there are some i elements i am critical of in the pp, such as having the play button to hear the option with a smaller live area than the button it's within (leaving little room for failure)."
rosettastone,5,0,"however, the content is fantastic and a great way to learn."
rosettastone,5,0,super effective and a nice pp in general
rosettastone,5,0,great way to sharpen skill.
rosettastone,5,0,so far so good.
rosettastone,5,0,easy to use
rosettastone,5,0,outstanding method of learning
rosettastone,5,0,was not so hard a little issue with my pronunciation
rosettastone,5,19,it has a very good balance of vocabulary training and pronunciation training.
rosettastone,5,19,it also reaches you about the grammar which a lot of foreign language apes lack.
rosettastone,5,19,it doesn't really let you go too fast either.
rosettastone,5,19,it really makes sure you understand before going on to the next lesson.
rosettastone,5,19,definitely recommend!!
rosettastone,5,19,!
rosettastone,5,1,"if you don't mind paying, this a has the best learning outside of complete immersion."
rosettastone,5,1,"you attach sounds with images and ideas, not to english words."
rosettastone,5,1,it tests your pronunciation.
rosettastone,5,1,"the written word is not for beginners, though."
rosettastone,5,1,"you may need another a to learn angel letters, chinese or japanese."
rosettastone,5,0,this pp is really helpful.
rosettastone,5,0,i never get bored learning english because of its fantastic and modern methods.
rosettastone,5,0,"when you start using it, you can obviously see how much effort they have put to it so users will enjoy and learn at the same time."
rosettastone,5,0,happy to had come across such an amazing pp.
rosettastone,5,0,"simple and fun, great pp"
rosettastone,5,2,good method and format.
rosettastone,5,2,i like that you can pause the exercises now.
rosettastone,5,2,i had a lot of success using this to learn german while stationed in germany while in the army.
rosettastone,5,2,i'm working on spanish now.
rosettastone,5,2,it wont make you client but it gives you a great start.
rosettastone,5,2,you can certainly carry a conversation by the time you finish.
rosettastone,5,4,"having tried memories and domingo, i find that this is by far the most in depth and consistent teacher of another language."
rosettastone,5,4,"i would like it to continue on beyond where it finished and would like the questions to be more randomised and call back to previously learnt topics, but it still managed to be the best."
rosettastone,5,2,i purchased the d version of tagalog (filipino) 12 years ago and it has been sitting on the shelf for the last 10 years.
rosettastone,5,2,i recently decided to pull it back out to try and learn more before another trip to the philippines only to discover there is no d drive in my lawton.
rosettastone,5,2,i decided to purchase the online subscription and i love it.
rosettastone,5,2,the method of learning is the same but greatly improved interaction with the pp.
rosettastone,5,2,i am thrilled to be able to use it on multiple devices too.
rosettastone,5,3,absolutely love the speech and communication breakdown technology and visual association!
rosettastone,5,3,each lesson is broken down to help improve pronunciation and build confidence speaking and perfecting tone and patience.
rosettastone,5,3,such neat educational technology development that is organized and super effective in producing results!
rosettastone,5,0,easy to use and fun
rosettastone,5,0,good pp but expensive
rosettastone,5,13,loved the pp because it actually reaches you the basis and how to pronounce the words correctly.
rosettastone,5,13,"i've been wanting to learn italian for some time now and this pp is the best, better than domingo, and it has languages that other apes normally don't have, so that's cool too"
rosettastone,5,1,"the system is really effective because it allows your mind to associate words with images, not their english translations."
rosettastone,5,1,"this prevents you from getting caught up trying to think of what you want to say in english and translating it, and instead allowing you to think of the language directly"
rosettastone,5,3,i usually use the lawton version because i think this method gets more effective by seeing larger picture and in a quiet room.
rosettastone,5,3,"however, for the use of the audit clips on the way, the pp version is useful."
rosettastone,5,3,thanks for the steady updated.
rosettastone,5,0,"i really like the fact that phrases, sentences, words are not translated into a language that i understand."
rosettastone,5,0,just a combination of picture and words and there you have it.
rosettastone,5,0,great approach to learning a language!
rosettastone,5,0,not to mention the convenience of having the pp with me wherever i go...
rosettastone,5,0,i really enjoyed learning japanese here.
rosettastone,5,0,it's more like a project based learning method than normal methods learning from recognizing the alphabet.
rosettastone,5,0,i think it will be more efficient for one to master a language.
rosettastone,5,0,good luck.
rosettastone,5,2,great..easy to use..very information.its clot like having you own personal utter with you whenever you need them..its one on one so you have the program all to yourself.i feel like his is the beat and easiest way to learn a new language..you get to learn at your pace so you dont have to rush through the lessons.
rosettastone,5,2,no language is available to be learned.its cheap so anyone can afford it and if there something you need to focus on in general then its not a problem.you can always fresh up
rosettastone,5,0,absolutely incredible.
rosettastone,5,0,you will surprise yourself with how fast and quick you will learn the basis of the language.
rosettastone,5,0,spanish in my case.
rosettastone,5,0,the structure of the learning process is done in a unique way.
rosettastone,5,0,you will cruise fearlessly throughout the learning units.
rosettastone,5,0,great pp!
rosettastone,5,0,love the easy steps and great ways to learn a new language.
rosettastone,5,0,"in short, the best of them all!"
rosettastone,5,0,i've used most of all the other apes but none of them can be compared to even the half of roseola stone.
rosettastone,5,0,it's awesome but need some feature..
rosettastone,5,0,"good , but only one lesson."
rosettastone,5,11,"i love rosettastone, i learned a lot and is fun."
rosettastone,5,11,i recommend it to everyone.
rosettastone,5,11,i have also taken the tutoring class and i been able to understand an answer all of my tutor's questions.
rosettastone,5,11,"the only thing i think they could improve is the ""microphone"" on the pp, sometimes it makes me repeat and marks the pronunciation wrong while on the webster marks it right"
rosettastone,5,1,i've had a blast learning makarin chinese.
rosettastone,5,1,"in my experience so far, roseola stone is best for asia languages because they don't do english association."
rosettastone,5,1,english association can be confusing with asia languages because they're so different.
rosettastone,5,1,that is my experience at least.
rosettastone,5,1,your brain learns it as though you you were fully immersed in the country.
rosettastone,5,1,the fee is a small price to pay for the amount of content you get access to.
rosettastone,5,0,i enjoyed learning with this pp.

rosettastone,5,0,unlimited languages at your fingertips.
rosettastone,5,0,surprised and relieved!
rosettastone,5,0,no translations to feel bad about when forgotten.
rosettastone,5,0,just started using this pp for makarin at a beginner's level.
rosettastone,5,0,"i'm just so relieved i've got a chance to put aside brute memorization technique and learn through a process of, what i'd like to say, elimination and revelation."
rosettastone,5,0,"i have utilized several, at least 5 different methods to learn hebrew, including those with personal teacher interaction -- as well as having researches over a dozen other methods before purchasing; yet, i have found roseola stone incredibly far more effective than any other method -- also, though i've formally studied both spanish & russian, hebrew is not an easy language for an american to learn, i have been surprised at how well through roseola stone that in a short time i've already..."
rosettastone,5,0,fun!
rosettastone,5,0,the way every letter or syllable is pronounced is different than english.

rosettastone,5,162,for me this is a great resource.
rosettastone,5,162,"however, i would suggest a basic background in german if you have never studied before."
rosettastone,5,162,"the noun declaration, propositions, sentence structures and verb congregations can be confusing to a novice."

rosettastone,5,2,having visited the netherlands me and my partner decided our retirement plan is to move there as we don't speak dutch i decided to learn first in most other languages i'm regarded as having a speech impediment making it hard to learn this pp actually recognises that and still tells me that i would be understood in the netherlands i'm looking forward to testing out a little bit of my dutch when i go for the next visit and hoping the eventually i'll pick it up and be client
rosettastone,5,1,liking it so far.

rosettastone,5,11,i use it for free through my local library.
rosettastone,5,11,"unfortunately the pp doesn't allow you to complete milestones like you can on the desktop version, and some of the pictures are difficult to see on my phone screen."
rosettastone,5,11,maybe if the borders between the pictures were smaller it would help
rosettastone,5,9,roseola stone provides the best service ever.
rosettastone,5,9,"they do all the work for you, just sit back and learn!"
rosettastone,5,9,the learning process is not overwhelming with complexities yet very reasonable with advances in the target language.

rosettastone,5,1,this pp is a good way to keep up with your language learning on the go.
rosettastone,5,1,"make sure your phone doesn't have a rotation lock installed (or set it to stock auto for this pp), since the venus are in portrait and the lessons are in landscape."

rosettastone,5,3,!
rosettastone,5,2,i love how it is challenging.
rosettastone,5,2,it's a nice contrast to other pp just teaching beginner stuff.
rosettastone,5,2,wouldn't use this pp by itself though if you are a beginner.
rosettastone,5,0,great so far.
rosettastone,5,0,love that it makes you associate the words with images and sounds rather than giving you the english.
rosettastone,5,0,seems a more immersion way to learn
rosettastone,5,0,"although it may seem prices up front, it is an excellent value for a busy person getting in a 20 minute lesson per day during breakfast."
rosettastone,5,0,"commit to at least a year's subscription, and it is pennies a day."

rosettastone,5,0,very convenient and easy to use on my phone (motor ze).
rosettastone,5,0,makes it interactive and fun to use.
rosettastone,5,0,i can use it anywhere when it's convenient for me.

rosettastone,5,0,this pp is really helpful!
rosettastone,5,0,"it's great because it doesn't directly tell you what anything means, it makes you figure it out, so it's resented in your brain."
rosettastone,5,0,really enjoying using this pp.
rosettastone,5,0,it is helping me learn a lot.
rosettastone,5,0,however it is not a replacement for speaking the language with a native speaker.
rosettastone,5,0,that's where you really learn!
rosettastone,5,0,i love it!
rosettastone,5,0,"i'm learning so much, but i don't like how it needs money to clock the rest of the tasks."

rosettastone,5,0,roseola stone focused on immersion rather than translation.
rosettastone,5,0,it's a little longer to get started (and much more expensive) but seems like the best way to learn a tough language.
rosettastone,5,0,i'm learning organ.
rosettastone,5,2,"good visual learning tools, l like the stories books, it would be an improvement to have an ai communicate back in conversation with different possible variations in that particular language."
rosettastone,5,2,i give this pp a 5.
rosettastone,5,0,i like being able to use roseola stone anywhere.
rosettastone,5,0,the pp runs cleanly and is almost more user friendly than the program itself.

rosettastone,5,1,"although, i must say that it is quite advanced, it's not at a beginner's level."
rosettastone,5,1,so if you have never learned spanish before i suggest you try to learn the basis then maybe try the pp.
rosettastone,5,1,but i'm sure you could try to learn with the pp as some activities are quite repetition.
rosettastone,5,0,this pp really helps you understand the language and pronounce it correctly at a reasonable pace.

rosettastone,5,0,"this pp is awesome, i was learning basic phrases and questions within an 90 mind of beginning its easy and you can go at whatever pace is comfortable for you, learning in school was never this easy."
rosettastone,5,0,go slow with learning the language as learning a lot of words could be difficult to remember.
rosettastone,5,0,although this pp helps a lot but its still difficult to remember all those words.
rosettastone,5,0,it's extremely easy to learn specially that i can speak with it at well
