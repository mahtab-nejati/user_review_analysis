"the app itself is a convenient learning tool, and i enjoy having a cup of coffee while learning a new language every day!",0
"â­ðŸ¦‰duolingo, in my opinion and experience, ist the number one app for learning for example german.",0
"eventough, that's something we can fix with premium!",0
and i'm considering it.,0
this app is total worth it!,0
4'5/5!!,0
!â­ love ðŸ’–,0
i got this app to learn japanese so i could eventally play japanese games without google translate.,0
"the first couple lessons were focused mainly on a small set of characters and the sounds they made, with one or two simple words tossed in.",0
"the next two lessons also have new characters in it, however are mostly focused on words, and not the new characters.",0
i can't learn with those.,0
it is very easy and fun at first.,0
i have been stuck for days on a level because of this.,0
it can be frustrating and rewarding at the same time.,0
wonderful to be able to access language learning at home and at a time to suit your own convenience.,0
"but still, a great app.",0
heather,0
i downloaded to learn mandarin.,0
it's good.,0
i've learnt numbers and greetings.,0
"for example i could recognise the numbers and match them to the characters and which were what numbers, but found it hard to just count to 10 on my own.",0
however a lot of practising helps,0
"this is really fun to use, while it is useful as well.",0
overall pretty good,0
as a virtual beginner it has given me a good start.,0
i find i can now read french somewhat but have some difficulty with understanding speech at normal pace.,0
slow speech i can deal with.,0
as a brit i have had to also learn american english.,1
but that's fine.,0
duolingo is an amazing app for learning a new language!,0
there is nothing i dislike about the app.,0
the only problem i've come across is this weird glitch.,1
it may be a server thing.,0
"but besides that, this app is definitely worth your time!",0
i highly recommend it.,0
a pleasure to use and fun at the same time.,0
the leagues make it a bit more competitive and motivational if you need it and the comments system allows you to learn from others as well.,2
quite addictive once you move up the leagues.,0
4 stars :),0
duolingo is a great app for casual and on the go people who want to learn a new language.,0
"i think that the home screen with lessons is clear, and it is easy to switch between language courses.",2
"its built to teach both beginners and pros, and its smart to let the learner replay lessons that they previously completed.",2
the app is better with uncommon languages.,0
"it's a fun app, and addictive.",0
worth checking out at any rate.,0
this app is really great for beginners to learn new languages but that is also its limit.,0
what's really good about this app is the fact that it's free.,2
"you have a 5 heart system that if you lose all your hearts, then you either buy duolingo plus or you can take more practice, to earn 1 heart back.",0
the practice tests are unlimited giving you a truly free experience while also encouraging you to practice your language more.,0
"duolingo is a great language learning app, but it's not perfect.",0
"any assistance to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated, danke schoen!",0
"duolingo is a very nice, efficient app for learning languages, which has become a hobby for me now.",0
"something happened, though, and unfortunately i can't give my full 5 stars.",0
"i took a test to advance through a lesson which i already know enough about, which i had to use 5 lingots for.",0
can something be done about this?,0
i love this app!,0
"i'm learning latin, because as a writer, it's something that i've always wanted to do.",0
"duolingo is terrific for folks like me, who instinctively ""get"" language and how it's structured.",0
that's it.,0
the hardest thing about duolingo for me is slowing down so i don't get too frustrated - but that's completely on me.,0
makes it fun to learn another language i did not give 5 stars as i feel that there still room for improvement.,0
this is really a handy little app to help teach you language basics.,0
easy to get the hang of.,0
quick to introduce higher level content.,0
in the free app you have 5 mistakes before you have to wait 4 hours to move on.,1
paid app there isn't a counter.,0
"paid app offers offline content, free app doesn't.",0
this is a solid app for getting an introduction to just about any language.,0
i like to practice with this app for a couple of months before i go an international trip so that i'm not completely lost when i arrive.,0
i gave it 4 stars because there are bugs from time to time.,0
"otherwise, i think this is a great and useful app",0
this app has been really good at giving some basic lessons.,0
other than that i've found this app really useful at learning some key vocab and sentences.,0
it's a great way to keep your mind active and learn another language.,0
there is room for improvement though.,0
"but i do love the format, ease of use, tracking of progress and my vocabulary is growing.",0
thank you!,0
"really helpful overall, with a few issues.",0
"i'm doing the japanese lessons, and there a couple of things other users have mentioned as not quite correct.",0
"as long as you do the research on your own, you can figure these issues out.",0
"overall, fun and useful!",0
this app is a great way to learn how the speak in a different language.,0
my only problem is that if you take a break off the app then when you come back you might not remember alot of the translations.,0
i tell you it is worth the paid version i was frustrated with the free version i love this app it has really helped me expand my vocabulary and understand verbs the only reason why it's not five stars is because i'm not that great at spanish yet lol and i think it would be nice to have practice conversations somehow in the app not just random things like your cat is pretty.,0
this is a good app .,0
for example a certificate which you could print off to remind yourself of how far you have progressed in your study.,0
i really like this app!,0
a great app overall!,0
"it's good, but lacks some needed features.",0
fun intuitive learning experience.,0
"some errors in the french learning module, however, that (according to question-specific message boards) have been outstanding for years, i.e.",1
therefore i personally almost always get the first try of those wrong.,0
i had no problem with this app until i upgraded it to the latest version.,1
how can i solve it?,0
a great way to learn a language!,0
easy to use and fun too.,0
it isn't fun having to put up with that nonsense.,0
i've been using this application and all was great since last week.,0
"very helpful to hear and see at same time, fast and slow speeds .",2
"encouraging to succeed, that is built into the app, so helps you continue trying language.. but quite clunky program.",0
but grateful for access.,0
great tool for language practice on the go.,0
it's perfect for learning languages.,0
although that would probably be more difficult to teach with how this app is set up.,0
i love this app.,0
it allows me to continue to practice and use the language that i learned without having a native speaker to speak with.,0
excellent app to enhance learning.,0
and what they mean.,0
i mix them up to much.,0
i've to close the app and open it again to fix it and sometimes it still doesn't work.,0
i hope you will fix this soon,0
stay focused and keep with it.,0
then i can not complete the courseðŸ˜,0
"while the introduction of the health system first ruined this app, its worst consequences were now fixed and you can regain hearts by solving more difficult lessons.",1
that's actually a good solution.,0
duolingo is fun again!,0
ultimately i don't think i make a lot of progress.,0
i'm trying to expand my limited french vocabulary and duolingo is definitely refreshing my knowledge and improving my speech.,0
this app seems pretty solid!,0
great app.,0
"wife already learned german, had many conversations in german with local speakers.",0
i'm learning spanish now that we are stateside.,0
thought it would be more useful.,0
can't wait to be able to communicate better with my soldiers.,0
it discourages me from using the app.,0
"before, we could even congratulate the weekly winners.",0
i hope the duolingo team take all these into consideration and effect.,0
this app is so amazing!,0
"it helps me a lot in learning french, english, and korean.",0
can you tell me what should i do or please fix this?,0
thank you.,0
nice program.,0
learning japanese.,0
the use of hiragana while learning words makes the characters stick well.,2
training based on three weeks of use.,0
pretty good app.,0
i just downloaded it and have all ready learned a lot.,0
great selection of languages.,0
very easy to learn and the app slowly increases difficulty.,0
it's a learning process and there has to be a little room for error.,1
please improve this function.,0
thanks ðŸ˜Š,0
very useful for learning french.,0
i have to say that i had passed the beginning levels in a class and that is why it was easy for me.,0
i don't know how to report the problem!,0
thanks for the good days,0
a bit too much forceful and overly motivating.,0
but it might be only because i am older and know what i want.,0
i do appreciate the work and time that went into producing the romanian course.,0
i t is imperative that these at least be reviewed by a native english speaker!,0
"so far, so good.",0
"covers reading, hearing, writing, speaking, translating from and to.",2
"i have no idea if it's teaching me latin american spanish or european spanish, but being a beginner, it might not matter right now.",0
"(are you listening, app developers?)",0
that needs to be fixed.,0
great app i feel like i'm learning more here than in spanish class.,0
"i like the app, i like the languages it promotes and the learning program and everything.",0
"so, that's the only part i don't like.",0
great app and fun to use.,0
"all the lessons are beneficial though, especially for a free app & i can certainly recommend it.",0
i like it alot but if i had not previously dabbled in the language i would be totally lost.,0
like i said if i had not dabbled in the language in my younger years i would have thrown my phone across the room and quit.,0
they are only featured on the computer version.,1
it should be available to all.,0
hopefully duolingo will change this.,0
excellent and getting better.,0
a bit harder for beginners with no knowledge.,0
"would like to see more done, such a new fun and situational activities.",0
the new reading one is excellent!,0
"idioms, flirting phrases and 3 outfits is it so far.",0
great for not letting my a level knowledge get rusty after years :).,0
great and free.,0
it's a lot of fun and i would recommend it to anyone who is totally new to a language.,0
i downloaded duolingo to learn arabic.,0
"it's a powerful learning tool for sure, and the interface is intuitive and well thought out.",2
"because of this, i've stopped using the app and moved on to a study guaranteed to reach only msa.",0
"for other languages, this app is a no brainier.",0
i find that too be very strange when there are so many lesser spoken languages,0
"if i was rating only the learning experience, 5 stars.",0
the lessons are fun and effective.,0
"i'm learning so much, and enjoying the process.",0
the app itself is 4 stars.,0
very good app for basic learning.,2
"the approach to learning is fun and easy, though.",0
no boring lessons.,2
the new gaelic course is well written and well thought out.,2
"very, very quick work to get it online.",0
congratulations to the epic volunteers ðŸ™‚,0
"suggestions from users are, however, mostly accepted.",0
"it is a great app, especially if you want to practice vocabulary.",2
"that's a pity, because many times the first word is an article and identifying the gender is a challenging part in some languages.",1
really great for free version!,0
i have had a great experience using this for the oast week.,0
refreshing my spanish because i've lost connection to my mother tongue.,0
wondering if it'sin the works as i'ma hands on learner.,0
i also have the keyboards downloaded on my phone to use as an option.,0
hope to see this included if it's not.,0
:),0
a very good way to learn the basics of a language.,0
"fun and quite addictive, which makes you want to keep using it.",2
the app is great!....,0
ðŸ˜Š,0
great app for learning a new language.,0
lessons are quick and the ads aren't terrible - just one at the end of each lesson.,2
"the app is great, especially if you are learning from scratch, but there are one or two little niggles that i found difficult to get past.",2
with japanese i went to another app that moves through the lessons more slowly but gives me a more solid grounding in things i really need to know better.,1
"having a fun time learning polish with this app, its ad driven for revenue but the ads are not in your face all the time which is nice, the learning format is fun and the progression is gentle.",2
i can only compare to the rosetta stone app which is obviously a lot more expensive in comparison.,0
if this was included i would definately buy the premium.,0
a great app to get your feet wet in learning a new language.,0
"sometimes, however, it is not always accurate.",0
"well the final two remaining were ""prego"" which means ""you're welcome "" in english, but the only remaining option to select was ""thank you"".",0
this could be very confusing to many people!,0
that would help.,0
love the incentives.,2
"great app, very helpful.",0
"my wife and i are learning french together, and we are having so much fun!",0
there is one issue i can think of.,0
"i am currently in the ruby league, and for the achievement i need to be in the gold league.",0
"sure, you can take the long way through the language, but it's time consuming and annoying.",0
doesn't completely replace traditional instruction but does a good job.,0
this app was great.,0
"so, would duolingo solve this problem?",0
it's a wonderful application.,0
i am an english speaker who had been studying japanese for 2 years prior to using this app.,0
"the app is very easy to use, but i have encountered some problems.",0
i also speak german so i practice on this app.,0
hopefully this will become better in the future.,0
"so far, very easy to use and im learning quickly.",0
i signed up for the free trial and its a lot better.,2
"but i am learning, so there's that.",0
this is a very good app for learning different languages.,2
it has many different languages to choose from.,0
"excellent way to learn with listening, writing, and speaking a new language !",2
this app is amazing!,0
i love everything about!,0
"i'm currently trying to speak french and korean, and so far i'm doing good in french!",0
i'd like to study any time without having to wait.,0
"so far, good job!",0
it requires your effort to learn properly.,0
"but it's a good app, functional, and with more effort i feel i could learn well !",0
great app.,0
great variety of languages.,2
definitely a great learning tool and it plays like a game so it taps into the reward centers of the brain and keeps you coming back.,2
"because some people don't want to write to someone, or something like that.",0
"but, duolingo is great in all other ways.",0
"however, it is staying 4 âœ´ until it is added.",0
and i really wanted to give this app 5 âœ´.,0
pretty good app.,0
very useful.,0
four stars but overall the app is great.,0
so far i've really enjoyed learning with duolingo.,0
however i am learning the fundamentals of sentence and word construction.,0
the syllabus is the best i've experienced with any language learning application i've tried.,2
i don't recommend only using duolingo though.,0
you should supplement with outside sources to learn how natives actually speak.,2
editing my review because after updates i have seen great improvement with the app.,2
"overall a good app, it's just a bit hard to get used to.",0
hopefully i can learn better the more i use it though.,0
this is a really helpful app.,0
i've learned so much already since i started using it.,0
but it can be very frustrating in the way that some of the features work.,0
i love it.,0
i can't believe how much i am learning.,0
plus it is free.,0
i'm using a free version and it's pretty good considering it's free.,2
i'm i upgrade that one day.,0
a great starting learning tool if you lack the proper time or schedule to take classes.,2
"so new learners with scratch their heads in confusion as to why ""boy"" is spelled as ""balach"" but in other phrases and exercises as ""bhallaic"".",0
this may also apply to languages with declensions.,0
pretty good for learning vocabulary.,2
doesn't use that much data or space (unless you have plus and download courses).,2
it's great for a free app and tries really hard to keep you motivated.,2
"for context, i was learning german through english.",0
really easy to use.,0
the free version comes with adds but they aren't too long and come at the end of the lessons rather that interrupting anything.,2
you can choose from a wide variety of languages to learn and the lessons are entertaining and challenging enough to keep you committed.,2
"very good for learning with much pictures, and it brings me lots of fun!",2
"i really love it, and it's easy to control yourself go keep doing it and it won't takes long everyday.",0
"oh whatever, it's really a good app.",0
download it!!!,0
),0
"learning arabic, german and french on duo is fun.",0
"there may be a few little flukes, but these can be discussed in the forum.",0
"for becoming a fluent speaker, you should immerse yourself in a language in different ways though.",0
this is a great app for languages.,0
"i'm in 5th grade, and i'm trying to learn korean.",0
"other than that, i love this app and i really recommend it.",0
this is an awesome application.,0
tyy for reading this comment and for making this app and updating it â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,0
i appreciate having an app that actually helps me learn spanish.,0
it is a blessing that it is free.,2
the ads are few and not too annoying.,2
"if so, then the slow pace is on me.",0
duolingo enables me to intensively practise polish.,0
both in reading and in writing.,0
"it is a good tool to practise speaking as well, however that is completely up to you, not required by the app nor checked by the app.",0
for that purpose i bought a book.,0
this is app is unique.,0
"it teaches you a language, for fun, for free.",2
"it offers a 7-day free trial for there upgrade to plus, and you can even compete on a leader board.",2
"there is one problem, though.",0
i lately have gotten too much homework to complete in one night.,0
so i set duolingo aside... and didn't have enough gems to buy streak freezers for 4 days.,0
"my 25 day streak disapeared, and the cute mascot was left crying in my inbox.",1
"not only the mascot that didn't deserve this, but my streak, gone.",0
however i have loved every moment of using this app,0
love this!,0
so convinient to use!,0
instead of spending mindddless hours on social media doing nothing you can learn something!,0
easy to follow and learn from...i didn't give it 5 stars only as it isn't perfect but it does appear as if they welcome the feedback to improve the software.,0
i enjoy learning the languages on duo lingo.,0
good and simple.,0
this app offers a way to learn english every day.,0
"its good actually, i'm learning a lot.",0
"but still a good app, probably just me, but please do some minor improvement for people like me that can easily get bored.",0
hoping for a fun learning experienceeee,0
"so far, very interesting and fun way to refresh my basic level of spanish.",0
"i am almost done with most of the levels available, not sure what happens next and if you need to pay to get to further levels.",1
already recommended to some friends.,0
their points system keeps me motivated to keep learning!,2
i'm learning japanese and they integrate kanji seamlessly into the lessons.,2
"after 3 years of studying japanese in school, i couldn't tell you any kanji.",0
"now with duolingo, i feel like a pro!",0
much more confident speaking to my family in japan.,0
this is a decent app for beginning to learn spanish.,0
"really educational, fun and easy to use.",0
it has been very helpful in getting basic phrases down.,0
i like using it when i want to relax and to my surprise i have managed to memorise some expressions and words although my sporadic use of it.,0
"i think is a nice app to use in one's free time to learn without stress and effort, but ease and comfort.",0
very good.,0
fun.,0
otherwise everything is good.,0
might just be my phone?,0
but it only happens with duolingo.,0
i find it easy to use.,0
it has built my confidence and desire to stick with the effort to learn spanish.,0
love the app.,0
this prevents me from moving on to the next question..please fix.,0
i'm using moto g5-plus,0
good language learning app that can be used for free without too many inconveniences.,0
it is a good app for learning new langues.,0
"duolingo strarts you off with basic levels, there is different subjects.",0
pretty good overall but has a few issues.,0
it's nice to use but i don't really like to type a lot.,0
i prefer to press on the words because it's quicker and my keyboard on my phone is not the best.,1
it's finicky.,0
but overall i like the app.,0
most of the times it's easy to use.,0
"been great learning it so far, easy to use while traveling or just have an extra moment.",0
it might later as i'm still new to this.,0
"great overall, glad to be learning!",0
!,0
"other than that, it's great!",0
i don't know how to explain it but i did learn quite a bit but for some reason i can't quite comprehend i could say or get the whole lesson class and leveling doesn't quite seem right or feel right if that makes any sense at all?,0
this is a great way to develop language skills.,0
i love that it gives me daily accountability and that i can do a little or a lot on any given day.,2
sometimes i confused in many words so i can't share my problem with them .,0
team duolingo please give an update with messaging feature as soon as possible,1
"i love this app, so far ive learnt alot.",0
pros: positive self-paced language app that does a great job.,2
even the ads are not overwhelming and horrible.,2
i think it would help in the learning process.,0
"it is a great app, i'm learning spanish and i think it is very effective.",0
i really love this app.,0
they are not as clear as i would like them.,0
i have learned though how to see the characters in hindi.,0
really learning alot.,0
thanks!,0
it is a very helpful app.,0
i am learning french and it is so much easier and fun to learn.,0
i recommend it.,0
misleading it says learn english.,0
but in options there are many languages.,2
fun and easy to use for now.,0
sure it will be getting harder.,0
i work on five sessions a day and am progressing well in french.,0
i hope duoliongo can solve this problem sooner.,0
this app is perfect to learn languages.,0
if there is marathi included then i am sorry for the comment.,0
ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„,0
"the app generally works well, my phone case makes it hard to complete the speaking sections.",0
so inane!,0
makes learning foreign languages easier than other methods for free.,0
"helps you to learn to not only speak, but also properly pronounce the words also which is important.",2
"good free app, ads are a pain but can get rid of if you pay plus you can also get unlimited hearts, but if your like me and don't like paying for extras you can still learn extensively without a problem using the app",1
"pretty good app for learning languages, especially for a free app.",0
"duolingo, please fix this.",0
"awesome way to refresh a language, but i find that if you want to learn from scratch, you should supplement duolingo with some other textbooks or learning software.",1
"feels like a game, but you're learning a new language.",0
super easy.,0
i love this app!,0
it has been a great way for me to learn gaelic!,0
"still, it's a great app!",0
i recommend it all the time.,0
i'm glad i have this to both review for my spanish courses and even learn irish gaelic from my heritage.,0
thank you developers!,0
"""some girls are cleaner than others"".",0
many fun and similar phrases to follow!,0
that would be useful.,0
great application for learnng and improving language levels.,0
very easy to use and learn from.,0
except when you asked in the comments for others opinion.,0
overall the app is excellent.,0
a nice app.,0
"but, overall, enjoyable.",0
very educational and very fun it lets you learn a lot of different languages!,0
duolingo so far has been very helpful in my learning experience.,0
"i personally need a lot more practice with learning new things, and thanks to this app, i can do that without burdening anyone else.",0
purely amazing!,0
it is very helpful and even refreshes your newly acquired knowledge of the language.,0
this is the perfect app for learning a language.,0
"very nice app, with nice exercises.",0
haven't spent to much time on it but so far it seems that it can provide a nice introduction to languages.,0
i've tried their names and emails yet it keeps saying no results found.,0
still this is a great way to learn a language that you like.,0
i'm having a great time learning a new language.,0
i really enjoy using this app and the challenges it presents when learning a language.,0
my boyfriend who is german was caught off guard when i told him good morning in german.,0
keep plugging along and hope to improve.,0
i think this app is helping me to wrap my brain around spanish.,0
i find it fun and just enough challenge to want to come back.,0
it seems that the recent few updates made it work worst.,1
categorizing the essentials seems to be very good.,2
very few glitches and the voices are clear most of the time.,2
i am enjoying the learning experience,0
"i'm really liking the way it allows me to check that, i'm getting the understanding of what i'm saying and, the prononciation of each word so that i am not sounding like a nut âœŒ",0
i'm thrilled that there is a free app for learning a language with such a smooth interface.,2
great app.,0
"a good, free option to practice another language.",0
"best if used as a supplement to a bigger, more fleshed out course.",2
i really enjoy this app.,0
"it's almost like playing a game, but i'm learning a language!",2
thanks!,0
very good.,0
other than that its amazing .ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,0
"overall, i love it.",0
please fix this.,0
otherwise the app is great.,0
the paid version does offer a little more in terms of ease of use compared with the freemium and helps to support a community of learners.,2
don't always have time to get them.,0
personally i think that they are useless ðŸ˜¤,0
btw it's pretty helpful.,0
very easy to learn if you have the time and eagerness.,0
above average to excllent.,0
to have a free app that drills one in a language is quite excellent.,0
"there are a few bugs (greek), but overall an app i heartily recommend.",0
duolingo is great to use if you are an avid traveler.,2
i like the easy set up and daily reminders.,2
"if you are trying to learn a language, duolingo is free, try it.",0
i have taken spanish for at least 4 or more years in my life but haven't been consistent.,0
i love the culture and language.,0
"i like duolingo because it makes you speak, read, and type your answers.",2
it also creates friendly competition to advance.,2
plus its free!,0
great and easy way to pick up a new language.,0
great app for learning various languages.,2
the lessons are progressive and fun.,0
you can also check on translations by clicking on the words to check.,0
enjoyable and educational.,0
occasionally frustrating but i find the comments section usually explains any quirks or glitches in the system.,2
has some faults but only slight and altogether a brilliant app,0
good app.,0
assisting me in learning a tough language in a very easy and playful way.,0
just love it.,0
really helpful and pleasant to use.,0
it is wonderful!,0
i recommend this app.,0
so far good.,0
simple to use.,0
user friendly.,0
all positive.,0
i don't need them to ensure engagement,0
"great for practising a language that you're somewhat rusty on, but not that good for learning a new language from scratch.",2
"a good teaching app for sure, and it is not a play to learn scam...i am excited and really do believe that if i apply myself daily with this tool, i can actually become fluent!",0
i like the style of learning.,0
my reading is still better than my speaking.,0
my hearing and understanding is improving.,0
"a bit slow, but aggressive in its reminders (which is exactly what i need in the busy times).",2
"so far its a great app their are alot of options to choose from and you get the first core lessons free before having to purchase anything not, only that but it is actually really helpful with being able to hear the word rather than just reading it and the fact that if you get some words wrong you dont have to worry about starting the whole lesson over there is an option to go back through once you finish to fix any mistakes, they also put the words you struggle with in to a revision lesson",2
"i've been instructed to ""use an apple product"" which i dont like or use.",0
"i'm feeling a little sh** on, here... i'll request a refund before spending $800 on a new phone, just so i can use their product!",0
will update if they ever correct this...,0
"it's fixed, but that was weird.",0
arg.,0
for a 12 year old this is pretty fun it gives you many ways to learn and it pretty easy to i am trying to learn japanese,0
"there is a free version with limmited use and adds, it will bug you to buy the premium thing but you dont have to.",0
"it asks you your levle of the language, what type of things you want to be learning (whether its the basics or tourist language).",2
"it judges your prounciation and asks you to repeat things, as well as flash cards with visual and hearing and spelling.",2
"it will give you new words without a defination, but your alowed to look at the translation.",0
realy great over all,0
lessons are interactive.,2
learning is more intuitive than traditional lessons.,2
the best part is the app lets you practice the sentences after you have used them to match the pictures.,2
so far so good.,0
it uses repetition to help understand the language.,2
the app is also easy to use.,0
it's really good for pronunciation and gets you speaking fast,2
i love this program.,0
the exrcises are interesting and helpful.,0
it's like i am playing a game but learning a language!,0
if this is enabled i rate all stars.,0
this is a really good app!,0
i havnt memorized alot yet but it is proboly because it is my first day.,0
its great and the apps seems to be working well.,0
i am trying the trial and i have decided that i want to get it for my family and myself.,0
it's very helpful when you are last-minute and need to learn quickly.,2
very nice pattern to learn any new language.,0
i can say it's best.,0
it very good learning apps but the in app price is high pls make it 10$ for a month otherwise it's a good app,1
free lesson is great but u have to pay for other lessons.,0
but its good though.,0
genuis!,0
"adding pictures and pronounciation is probably what makes this app so successful, one top of that the structure of learning is very good.",2
i can feel my brain making associations.,0
strangest thing but beautiful to recognise.,0
no english even needed!,0
"so far, so good.",0
"just started, but this seems the best app i have found so far to learn italian.",0
it seems like a good app so far.,0
i just wish learning these different languages didnt have to cost anything...i mean that's what everyone lacks is communication skills regardless of region.,0
but it's not my call lol,0
learning has never been easier.,0
the pictures and repetition mean i really absorb the content.,2
so far this app is very helpful with learning a new language.,0
it's not easy learning japanese but so far i'm having fun doing it.,0
not a really great experience if you don't pay .,0
"if i had no previous hebrew studies, this app would not be very helpful.",1
my knowledge of hebrew vocabulary is the only reason i have any idea what i'm saying or hearing.,0
nice app and very user friendly.,0
i would say this language software is a great supplement to learning a new language.,0
easy patterns and simple instructions.,0
all you need is persistence and the willing to learn.,0
"pretty good, wish i could get to the level im already at and go from there but the beginning stages are a good refresher",1
i like the app.,0
it helps me with my homework and other languages i always wanted to lear,0
it's really good (^^)!,0
good app and walks you through easily and logically,0
iteractive and informative .,0
very straightforward and practical,0
pretty good.,0
the 30 min lesson took less than 30 minutes.,0
please help,0
good job with having you repeat words so you retain it with images.,0
it could be fun if only i had the attention span to keep up with it,0
a great app for learning a new language intuitively.,0
it uses pictures to build associations between your new language and the word's meaning.,2
simply asking you to try again.,0
that said it is a brilliant app and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn a new language.,0
i used it and went to a french conversational class.,0
"early days so no conversational stuff yet, but a really good foundation.",0
"i recommend learning in conjunction with an audio program to get additional speaking practise in (with mandarin, it's all about the intonation).",1
"so far, so good.",0
"even with those issues, rosetta stone works well for me, even with its 'throw em in the water and hope they swim' strategy.",0
it actually works and helps me learn the verbs and grammar of the target language without explanation.,0
"i must say, thanks, rosetta stone!",0
it's pretty good!!,0
"the mobile version of rosetta stone is great, but has some flaws.",0
"mild annoyances, but overall worth your time and money.",0
user friendly and i am learning.,0
you never know if you are perceiving it wrong and therefore learning the language wrong.,1
"especially in the beginning, you don't want to mess up the basics.",0
"if using this app, learn the words first on another app but then use this one to practice those basics.",1
"even though it wouldn't be the first app i would use, it is still really great practice!",0
i like rosetta stone's approach.,0
"the zero translation and repetition until it sticks seems to work best for me even if it can feel a little tedious at the time, it's still fun to use.",0
it also includes more speaking than other apps i've used as well as listening exercises where you can't read what's being said which is good practice for conversations.,2
"a lot of reviewers mark it down for no translations which is the whole point of rs, would recommend trying it",2
good way to learn on the go.,0
speech recognition works well.,2
no crashes or delayed response in lessons.,2
pretty good but i think it starts at a weird place ??,1
maybe it's made for people who already have some knowledge on the language.,1
i'd like to know exactly what i'm saying you know ?,0
other than that i really like it.,0
it's a very useful and well put together app and program.,0
im only on lesson 2. i am familiar with japanese.,0
"its seems good at introducing vocab and gramma, as well as kanji.",0
i enjoy spending time on it.,0
great app.,0
pretty good so far.,0
being a new user i liked the most part of this app it has a very easy interface that a beginner can also use very smoothly and can be familiar with any new language he want to learn.this app also lets us to learn new languages with a very easy method with a great convenience of time.,2
great app to learn from,0
i really like rosetta stone because they teach you how you pronounce the words but i just wish that they gave you an actual schedule to follow that shows what you should do everyday because i have found some other things on the app that i didn't even know were there or when to use them.,1
find spend more time with this language app than others.,0
pat,0
that is aggravating.,0
otherwise the program seems to function well for other lesson types.,0
great native speakers.,2
great!,0
starts with basic but engaging exercises.,2
there are exercises focused on this to which are very useful.,0
i love how easy it is to use,0
this could have been bad.,0
it's still an easy awesome way to learn.,0
"i like it, i'm learning- slowly.",0
easy to use and easy to alternate between the app and the computer lessons.,2
being able to download lessons to use off line is handy,2
so far so good.,0
even without doing the initial intro to explain it were able to figure what they were doing in the pictures.,0
so far so good.,0
good app for simple learning french quickly.,0
immersion works better than vocabulary for me personally,0
trial seems pretty helpful.,2
i'm trying to learn a language for a trip coming up.,0
yes it really is good.,0
but thought it was free.,0
just unit 1 is available.,0
but that's fine.,0
thanks,0
easy to use.,0
easy memorization.,0
good app for perfecting your pronunciation.,2
it breaks difficult words into syllables and sound to help.,2
"after having my eyes set on rosetta stone for several years i've come to discover that there are better products for less, such as doulingo or memrise.",0
good and clear pronunciation.,0
i like it.,0
am sure my prononciation is improving as i move ahead learning,0
but i'm learning and that's a big plus thanks,0
quite enjoyable tool indeed.,0
it is a fun learning experience.,0
thank you rosetta stone.,0
"so far, so good.",0
i'll check back in once i'm past chapter 1... :),0
really good at helping you retain information,0
working fine so far,0
"i am just at the beginning , i like it.",0
it is easy to understand and learn,0
i've only completed a few lessons but am already picking it up.,0
i like it so far.,0
user friendly app!,0
works well to teach language.,0
helpful and images are great and easy to remember,2
very good and easy,0
very intuitive and comprehensive.,2
it's a process for sure but a great tool for learning,0
very nice and helpful,0
learning curve made easy,0
"just getting started so too early to give 5 stars, but so far this is great!",0
i think it's very good.,0
this app make you learn the language.,0
"great so far, but really a refresher.",0
interested in how it will progress.,0
"it's great for the deal they are offering, brings them at or below the cost of the other paying services",0
what am i saying?,0
it tells me with pictures and ect- but what am i saying exactly?,0
very helpful in grasping a foreign language,0
easiest way to learn s new launage should use this in schools rather then a teacher,0
simple to use and convenient,0
it's easy to use and a fun way to learn,0
a great addition to other programs,0
easy to learn and use,0
they give you the perfect platform to start to learn is up to you to be consist that so don't blame the program blame yourself for not being consistent on doing the work,0
so far easy to start and learn 1st lesson!,0
"learn, fun & easy tool(:",0
good app to refresh with as well as learn,0
otherwise i feel i am learning,0
this is my first time learning another language on an app and i am very thankful for your app you very much for helping me trying to learn new english new languages to learn and talk any languages with my friends,0
working on spanish using both rosetta and duolingo.,0
"so far i feel they work similarly, but i personally enjoy rosetta more",0
educational and engaging.,0
challenging but fun!,2
great and fun,0
it's good for your fluency and help you spell and be a good reader.,0
i to like this app can help a lot of people in the world ask me my parents my family everybody in the world can you this app.,0
i find it very useful and convenient,0
just starting week 2 (day 9).,0
fun is not the right word.,0
but effective might be.,0
we'll see.,0
fun and easy!,0
i tried learning portuguese as kid by using rosetta stone.,0
i was easilu distracted and i didn't learn the language.,0
now that i am older i am able to appreciate the app by how it teaches someone how to learn a language.,0
truth be told.,0
"this app is hard, but fun and worthwhile if you are willing to put two hours everyday into learning a language.",2
"trust me, i am already seeing great results with my mandarin class.",0
learning to speak spanish by thinking in spanish.. wow.. the app.is really good..,0
and the monkey flips the switch.,0
its great to learn a new language,0
this program is the best at learning a new language,0
very nice and well done!,0
i think i am catching on.,0
will see how it goes.,0
very satisfied so far with unit 1 completion,0
fun learning and needs working here and there but greay,0
"my reason for not leaving 5 stars is because the app and website are so different, and i use both!",1
"in high valyrian, the grammar explanations dont exist in app, but do in the website.",1
"in the app you can ""break"" your completed lessons and restore them, but not in the website.",1
"also in the app, some lessons are longer/shorter than on the website.",1
i'd like to get consistency,1
"korean for example it's more difficult for me, because i don't understand the characters so i make a lot of mistakes trying to guess the meaning and because i'm not premium, i waste hearts.",1
"i know that practicing you earn hearts, but in this way it's difficult to advance.",1
"the only ""practice"" these lessons have for the new characters is a match the character to the sound.",1
except it does not actually teach you what the words mean for a while.,1
"that's somewhat confusing, especially when it adds unknown words.",1
you have to guess what the phrases say to translate.,1
please work on translating english to arabic words a little more.,1
"sad to see the heart system in place, pushing people to opt for the plus option.",1
"perhaps if this option was cheaper, more would access the service.",1
"also, more explanation of why something is wrong would be very helpful.",1
it randomly throws in things like characters and sounds and words.,1
sometimes i'd forget what something means and have to wait for it to come back up when practising rather than just looking at what it means.,1
"i am trying to learn russian and i'm only having issues with using the microphone to speak the words, i feels like i'm saying it properly but it says incorrect i just brush it off.",1
i would like to see if it could teach sign language or even braille.,1
sometimes the voice audio is not brilliant.,1
"when i open the app, it often says ""there was a problem with the connection"" even though my wifi is fine and i can access other wifi required applications just fine.",1
personally i would prefer more spoken challenges but otherwise a great app!,1
"very good app, good lessons design, balanced and very addictive, unfortunately like for other apps you need to pay to get unlimited time and advert free, but for begininnig is more than you need, before you use all hearts its enough to learn the app and decide if you want to buy premium, i will definitely, knowledge is priceless!",1
i do think that duo would benefit from teaching the letters or alphabet in the languages that use an alphabet.,1
"spanish, for example, has a limit on what you can learn per day, which doesn't exist on some other languages.",1
but the drawback of those uncommon languages is inconsistent audio clips.,1
some sound like they're from the inside of a tin can and are really hard to make out.,1
"i am learning chinese and japanese and duolingo has taught me how to read, hear, and talk; however it didn't teach me how to write.",1
users are also not able to customize the theme of the app or change the voices of narrators.,1
"on the bright side, tests are simple and beginner-friendly, but it won't allow you to be very proficient in the language you learn.",1
"it gives tips on each lesson module, but there are no external links embedded.",1
"i actually enjoy this app quite a bit, the reason why i gave it four stars is because there was a pop-up advertisement that said if you got your friends to join that you would get a week of free unlimited access.",1
i got two of my friends to join which means i should have two weeks of unlimited access yet for whatever reason this does not appear to be the case.,1
app crashed in the middle of the quiz.,1
"once i restarted the app, i'd lost the lingots and need to use 5 more lingots again.",1
"the only thing i think that would make the app better is not only a translation, but a brief explanation of your error when you get something wrong.",1
"one suggestion is to have more tips, guidelines especially when it comes to sentence construction.",1
"i am studying japanese now, and i have to regularly google to understand some concepts (wa, ga, ka, etc).",1
"there is a forum and while the comments are useful, i can't always filter which is exactly an ""opinion"" or an actual correct answer..",1
my only issue is how hard they push the paid program.,1
it feels like the free app is more of an advertisement/trial for the paid app.,1
free app has tons of advertisements.,1
"fyi the sound won't play or the images won't show, but it's rare, and not unusual for a free app.",1
the thing i really don't like is that there is no way to report these bugs!,1
"a couple of things that would make it even better though; being able to look over past lessons for reminders if you haven't been on the app for a while, and have some sort of vocab dictionary of all of the words you've learnt so far.",1
"i think if they made it so you could hear the sound of new words /phrases when they're presented it would help learn faster, in my opinion.",1
"also it would be beneficial if you could chat with others, perhaps someone that speaks the language you're learning to help get used to writing in a conversational manner and someone trying to learn our language could chat with us for practice too.",1
so happy to learn scottish gaelic but the american english requires a level of translation for english.,1
"a bit buggy in the audios, how i was taught to pronounce things at gaelic classes by native speakers in glasgow can be different as well as different phrases.",1
it might be better if you were put back a level or two once you've had a break.,1
however if there was more little virtual rewards for getting to particular levels i think it would be good.,1
"it can actually teach you a new language and does a great job encouraging you, but something that i want developers to add (pleasee) is dark mode (because it's 2020 and only having light mode is quite outdated).",1
"i'm taking an english-german course, and only half of the lessons have ""hints"" (which is actually required if you want to learn a language).",1
"also, the hints on desktop are much more mature than the mobile ones",1
not accepting one of two correct answers for the write what you hear questions.,1
overall helpful but sometimes new characters you haven't seen before are put in front of you when you have to figure out a complete statement.,1
i don't have the sound so i can't do the listening exercises.,1
"anyways, the microphone works and i have no problem with speaking parts.",1
"i wish there was more explanation about different endings to words, and an option to pay monthly for the service but will definitely keep using it.",1
"it's a very good app, but i think u should add something has the ability to till us if our pronunciations is right or wrong and that would be perfect,one more thing, please add arabic language ðŸ’“",1
fun and addictive but my maxed out learning topics keep breaking even if i got my streak and did lessons i come on later in the day and they all break.,1
voice for some exercises doesn't work and i can't do listening exercises... very bothering,1
"content is high quality, ads are quite intrusively annoying but i guess they have to make money somehow, and the ad free option is way too expensive.",1
it would also be amazing if it was able to teach different kinds of sign language too!,1
"it's great, i just wish they would spend more time on verbs.",1
maybe have separate lessons where you learn just the verbs.,1
the mic doesn't work well and stops a lot.,1
small bugs thay hang up the ohone but can easily switch to the computer to bypass those (usually happens during a practice),1
"it's an interesting app to boos my dutch,but i don't know why there is no voice in listening exercises!!!",1
the app' gives lots of revision of words i already know.,1
i don't think i get enough repetition of the things i fail on.,1
it's really good and helps me learn spanish very easy but the hearts are just annoying especially when you only have one left and you get a question wrong you can't save your progress ðŸ˜ž,1
"why has ""tips"" suddenly disappeared?",1
each lesson segment used to have a tips section with basic info on that subject and it's just gone...,1
"i really like this app, only problem is that it doesn't have my language in it sadly.",1
i'm hoping duolingo will add some more languages in the future.,1
would be nice if they gave more definitions.,1
"it is great for brushing up in my chinese skills, but it was impossible to learn ukranian since i dont know the alphabet.",1
this new health system should be abolished.,1
"i prefer the former groups before you introduced these leagues, we normally compete in a group and complete challenges, that was more fun than this present league.",1
i really loved the app but sadly these recent features are not reaching my satisfaction as a consumer.,1
newest update: 12.30.19 i don't know what happend but i can't use the speaking ability test.,1
"each time i tried to speak, the microfon suddenly turned off by itself.",1
"i've waited for an hour until the mic turn on again but the same things kept happend until i uninstall it and re- download it, but nothing happend.",1
"it still the same, the mic won't work.",1
the only problem is that since you are learning something new you are going the make mistakes and the whole heart thing ruins that.,1
otherwise it should provide an opportunity to teach alphabets to learners.,1
"btw, from the second level i couldn't hear the voices.",1
"it was a very good experience for me learning french with duolingo, untill recently i have found a bothering problem with sounds, i'm reporting the problem of sound missing in every single exercise and it's still there.",1
"now i'm considering leaving duolingo, without sounds playing it's more likely waste of time for me.",1
"too many interruptions to the lessons, too much focus on bonuses based on gaming theory.",1
"main issue is the interaction of the app with the phone keyboard and dictionary, an improvement would really help.",1
"it's utility is greatly lessened, however, by the frequently incompetent or confusing translations, which make it impossible to know what the romanian actually means.",1
"one annoying detail, is that the lessons accept the ""down arrow / new line"" button on the android keypad as an alternate enter button, in addition to their ""check results"" button.",1
"since the ""new line"" button is right below the backspace button, i often submit an incorrect answer when i'm only trying to correct a typo.",1
"i like the app, it's just why do you only get a certain amount of hearts.",1
if you lose< how come you have to quit and lose all your progress.,1
my only complaints are i think the hearts should be unlimited.,1
i like learning spanish and i can't do that if it's limiting me on how many mistakes i'm allowed to make.,1
and when i do the speaking test i'm positive i'm saying it right and it dosen't process right sometimes and i loose a heart.,1
"but what i don't like is that i have to wait like 5 hours for 1 heart, so you can't really make mistakes when that's part of learning a new language.",1
i think we should get more hearts like 5 hearts in an hour.,1
only lost a star as i think it would be helpful to have a section on phrases you will need on travelling to italy earlier on which i personally would have found reassuring.,1
"good with basics, but you would have thought the ads pay for the lessons, bit you have to get these heart things which discourages you from learning.",1
i wish they had something that explains the tense of words it really would be helpful.,1
"i also hate that when your out of hearts you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can play again, unless you accumulate them through practice runs.",1
it's a great app but sometimes the hints don't exactly help you with questions.,1
plus some languages don't have the tips section.,1
i'm learning russian and there is no tips page so i have to assume what the ending of the noun is.,1
there's also not much content regarding what you can spend your lingots on.,1
"would love a range of outfits to motivate me to earn more lingots, or a house!",1
would also love thai to be available.,1
unfortunately doesnt work well put of good wifi zones - crashes and fails to work on 4g,1
sadly enough you can't start at a higher level,1
"however, for learning arabic, i would tread with caution, as the lessons have a bad habit of mixing modern standard arabic with dialectal arabic, which should never be done.",1
looks great but it didn't have thai.,1
"it frequently freezes, and randomly doesn't record my progress.",1
there also seems to be issues syncing between the website and the app.,1
"i would like to see the stories on the app, not just the site.",1
and it would be nice to be able to collapse the lessons once you pass a checkpoint.,1
all that scrolling is tedious.,1
:) and a vocab review.,1
"the only downside is that it does not explain rules or basics, so the approach is really intuitive (a guessing game sometimes, and left to your interpretation of the rules as you go along in learning translations).",1
would be good if they had a reference portion if you want to understand grammar rules.,1
"the only reason it is not 5 stars is one of the voices has too thick an accent to hear properly, and it is only on guess work that i get the words and phrases correct when her voice is used.",1
"being dutch, it is interesting to use this app but often very frustrating, particularly with computer voices that race through a sentence with the consequence of misunderstanding the words.",1
"the translations into english are often strange to my ears, obviously 'dictionary translations' and not in english vernacular, having unusual placement of nouns and verbs.",1
"the dutch is often extra long winded, not simple to translate, even for me.",1
"i have a couple of suggestions: 1) the sentences are never too complicated and they rarely used vocabulary from previously completed lessons; 2) in the word selection pool most of the time the first word has a capital letter, which makes it too easy to identify.",1
"for new languages however, i'd like for there to be writing included.",1
"i can type in the spanish, but for the korean and japanese there isn't even tracing.",1
"when it works.ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸ for those having offline courses not downloading, i just cleared my data under the duolingo app in settings and it fixed my issue.",1
"i had to log back in, but at least it was better than waiting a week for a response from their team (that never happened).",1
"besides this one bug and no email response ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸, the app is great.",1
"the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the speaking portions; i'm taking korean, so i don't know if the other languages are like this, but the lady talks way too fast.",1
"there's no option for her to speak more slowly, or to say the sentence in parts.",1
it'd be helpful if you could practice the sentence in parts more slowly before trying to repeat the whole thing.,1
will you be adding basque to the list at some time?,1
"4 stars only because i would like to see a feature whereby it listens to my pronunciation, which rosetta stone does have.",1
"for example, in a ""match the pairs"" part of the italian portion, it asks to match the english words with their italian translation.",1
"very good, only want to communicate casually, annoying to be punished for minor spelling mistakes but otherwise can't complain at all.",1
"i love this app, it should start full conversations though.",1
"( completing the circles, etc) but it's too picky about minor spelling errors.",1
you have to keep typing a whole long complicated sentence over and over because of one or two small errors.,1
the more complicated grammar is equally frustrating.,1
the more different grammar needs to start with simple tasks rather than whole sentence translations.,1
some of the achievements are bugged.,1
"however i've already completed the league, and did not get the achievement.",1
"great app, but please fix your achievements.",1
"the way duolingo teaches is great; however, the app is increasingly adding paywalls and is taking most user interactivity away.",1
"clubs, which were a good way for users to learn from each other if kept active, were discontinued, and leaderboards replaced them.",1
"leaderboards make people more competitive, but there's no way to root for each other or learn about others so that they are more than just numbers...",1
"robot voices for spoken french, japanese, and german makes it difficult to know if pronunciation accurate but is a relatively ok stand-in for humans speaking.",1
grammer lessons would be a very welcome addition.,1
actually it would be great if it didn't have the problems that it has now  for example the women don't talk anymore or the listening won't be listened or error to load a lesson and so on.,1
"however, there are some minor changes i would like to see: 1. please make it harder to pass the test (i have never failed once) 2. please add drawing characters in different languages (not just choosing) otherwise, it's a wonderful free application with only a 2-second ad at the end of each lesson.",1
sometimes the sound files are broken and also if the english translation isn't exactly as the have it the answer will be marked wrong.,1
the german language app is more complete than the japanese app.,1
"however, the ads are very annoying and you only get so many chances to get the answers right or you have to wait until the next day.",1
"i find that there is no explanation of words before hand, you're left to figure it out on your own.",1
you also have to spell correctly to complete challenges.,1
its more of a bunch of quizes than a relaxed learning experience.,1
"i rated this four stars instead of five because although it's very helpful, most of the sentences they teach you, you wouldn't need to know or they are things that you wouldn't normally say.",1
"i think they should teach you basic sentences that you would use everyday rather than something like ""lots of young men live in america"" or something similar to that.",1
"besides my journey, there is one thing bother me and it is the hearts.",1
it would be a lot more fun if i didn't have to wait four hours for at least one heart.,1
"you need to do lots of practices, and spend more than 5-10 minutes a day or you won't learn much !",1
would be great if it had a speaking only option and a written option as i feel speaking it is more important than reading mostly.,1
"one drawback for me is, (in italian) the lessons aren't comprehensive.",1
"three or four verbs are introduced (sometimes without all the conjugates, which makes irregular verbs difficult), but the exercises will ask for dozens of verbs that weren't introduced.",1
"while it's a great app (and i use it enough to use the paid version), i still need a notebook to write down and learn verbs with all their conjugates, along with all the nuances of the language.",1
the lessons could stand to explain certain things a little better though.,1
like each lesson should have a little intro that lays out what will be covered.,1
i would like it much better if there is an option to turn the writing portion of the language you are trying to learn off.,1
just needs more words in every category possible :) thanks,1
i noticed that you don't learn the alphabets yet.,1
it feels slow paced as i expand my french vocabulary.,1
but now i am very disappointed in the lack of lessons.,1
you would get up to 20 lessons at the higher levels which is good for retention as repetition is key but now you only get 4 for each level and that is ridiculous.,1
"ok, this app is a great free language-learning app, but i just feel like it doesnt teach you correctly sometimes in the exercises, and it doesn't give you too many tips during the lesson either.",1
so if you have the patience and willing to dig for some answers when it marks you wrong (even though 90% of the comments from other users on the app show that your answer was the same as theirs) you might really enjoy this app.,1
"i wish the lesson would explain a little more, but the community is so friendly and willing to teach it makes up for the lack of content in the lessons.",1
"i really love the app except for one piece, the health.",1
"i get they are trying to push the premium service, but the website doesn't employ this feature and i can learn all day.",1
but if you get into a lesson you struggle with on the app your health can run out before even completely finishing a single lesson.,1
the reason i don't give it 5 stars is because grammar rules aren't explained you just learn how to say things in other languages.,1
"in the scottish gaelic, for example, the lenition rules aren't explained properly.",1
"the incentives to practise leagues regularly are mostly positive, except for the 'leagues' feature.",1
can run a bit slowly on my phone.,1
"the occaisional bug making lessons unpassable, very rare, i've only seen them in practise mode",1
"but the errors, the lack of some vital information while learning and the pure translation-focus of the app takes away from the learning experience in my opinion.",1
"but, maybe it will be kinda lots of ads and makes you send some money on the better version.",1
i hope duo further develops 'stories' to help with immersion.,1
"the reason i took off one star is because it's a little straight forward, and when you're still learning the alphabet or something, the next thing is something you've never seen before.",1
i also don't like the lives/hearts and how you have to wait to refill them.,1
"please, i cant do audio lessons.",1
he cannot start recording somehow.,1
"and please, add a lesson to learn the symbols of the language, letters, kanji, etc.",1
"i love it so much and it helped me a lot learning a new language but the"" hearts "" take a very long time to refill that lead me to quit the app and i wish u would look at this matter and make it better!!",1
"i wish the progress was faster, but the pace seems related to my demonstrated proficiency.",1
the only thing missing is some explaination of theory.,1
"love this app, it's very useful for learning all types of different languages, it's very useful because i am using it for school, i just wish you didn't have to pay to get more unlimited hearts, or just make it so you have more hearts, beside that it's a great app.",1
"has helped me for sure, but small criticism would be that it is overly repetitive.",1
"repetition breads familiarity, but i feel it can be too repeititve.",1
perhaps an algorithm to measure how many times you got something right or wrong could be used to progress quick learners more quickly?,1
"superb but try to avoid repeating the same sentences in the same lesson several times, it becomes very boring in fact, try to use the words you want me to learn in different sentences to avoid making anyone feel boring, and one more thing, each lesson have many levels, try to make each level is especial and make me feel that i learned new thing even a new sentence",1
i love using duoling but sometimes it takes soo much to load the lessons and sometimes it cant load them:(,1
problems with timing of the speech function makes me miss words on the app that i didnt mispronounce,1
the latin course forces you to an english sentence structure for translations.,1
"i like the app, but honestly the passive aggressive notifications get on my nerves.",1
if you skip a day the notifications get snippy.,1
at times iacnt hear any of the audio but it might be the fact that i have a crappy phone otherwise great app.,1
"but i think the process is a bit slow :/ waaaayyy tooooo slooowwwww that instead of pushing myself to learn, i get bored and annoyed.",1
there is a lot of repetition in the lessons which seems to limit the amount of new words that could be introduced under each category.,1
its mainly learning vocabulary and not verb conjugation.,1
occasionally have issues with lessons loading up and there have been a couple of the speaking questions that wouldn't accept your answer unless it was in english but all in all it's a good app.,1
"it doesn't do much to explain some of the syntax and the voice speaks too quickly when you do some of the audio tests but for a free app this is very, very good.",1
"the app is enjoyable to use and motivating, but you need to get a book with some grammar in to understand the rules of the language",1
silly typos can get annoying but overall awesome product,1
teaching methods are great but please add urdu to the languages taught.,1
"also, if the tips contained a list of all the vocabulary taught in lesson for memorizing it would also help (ex: for japanese, all the letters with their pronunciation).",1
"a fun way to learn, however the app could use a glossary of words you've learned, as well as a proper pronunciation guide.",1
"i can copy the voice perfectly, yet the app still won't register that i've said it correctly.",1
"it's a good start for a new language, but the audio seems to cut out for no reason periodically.",1
there are times when i must select words and i can't because they don't fully appear on the screen.,1
it lacks a bit of depth to explore the grammar or actual dialogs to listen to and learn from.,1
"if you get like 5 wrong on a lesson and you don't have duolingo plus well ,your heart will have no lives and you'll have to wait 4 hours and about 23 minutes.",1
lessons sometimes start without giving you enough information such as using words not previously taught.,1
would be nice to have a vocab library to keep track of words you've learned so far.,1
i wish it let you practice the so each part more.,1
"it's has helped me learn the basics so far, but the only small complaint i have is knowing how to resume where i left off in the lesson.",1
i would say the app isn't well organized in the home screen.,1
could say don't like the whole set up and everything for leveling and ect ..,1
"nice application, very interactive, but i would have loved it more if we could possibly be able to do an online quiz competition with our friends, would be nice.",1
however i have encountered glitches and reported it but never received any sort of response.,1
"the app interface is awesome, but for some languages like mandarin, i feel that it is not beginner friendly.",1
it's more of an intermediate practice for people who already know the basics in my opinion,1
i love this app but i find one fault in it that i couldn't talk to native speaker .,1
my only suggestion is to design better contexts for the lesson you work on and some more detailed explanations as to why the answer is right or wrong,1
"i love the app and it teaches me a lot, but i am still learning a language and whenever i get a word wrong i lose health points and you have to do a lesson and get them all right to earn back health points.",1
i gave it 4 stars because i don't really like the idea of hearts i think you should be able to just keep on learning rather than being forced to pay Â£60 a year for infinet hearts,1
con: would like to see explanations of grammar.,1
"however, because we have to have hearts, it slows down learning progress.",1
"duolingo, please can you stop the hearts as they let down your app.",1
the app is great but sometimes the voice just stops working,1
i just have a hard time hearing the sounds.,1
"i use a phone and tablet, phone app has more oral exercises.",1
as an australian some of the american usage is frustrating in translation.,1
"it is a good app to learn languages but lately it has problem doubling the lingots, it supposedly to watch the adv for few secs but turns out the screen goes all black and stuck.",1
just that there are some specific languages which could be involved like marathi but other than that it is all awesome.,1
what i hate is that you have to complete the day's lesson by midnight in order to maintain your streak.,1
"issue is, i cannot add my friend so that we can track each other's progress.",1
"the hearts are a bit annoying, and i wish the app wasn't so pushy for you to get pro, but otherwise it's great.",1
i do wish there was a tab for explanations of things like why the same word can be spelled different ways.,1
"i also appreciate the ui, the only thing is i wish the duolingo podcasts had a tab in the app rather than a separate webpage.",1
"really great app for free use, but they may need to review some of the romanian phrases.",1
would've been great if you add latin.,1
and also add an option wherein you look for simeone to chat in order to practice your language.,1
"and yeah, can you add a feature where we can save tips offline?",1
it just dont have many explanations for the usage of words.,1
might be useful if they put how a word is used in grammar properly.,1
i think it could and should be one of the apps that you don't need to connect to internet for it will be nice for that otherwise great for kids and adults.,1
"somewhat repetitive, but can move forward easily.",1
should be some explanation of vowel usage.,1
"lessons move along a bit quick for me, need more time to learn the symbols(letters) new words are not well expressed before expecting you to know them.",1
however i gave it a four because of way too many adds however i recommend you download ðŸ˜‰,1
amazing app but sometimes the formulation of the sentences seem weird and also in some cases they ask you to translate something and it is just a name that you have to rewrite like : hallo hans > hello ...,1
it is sad that there is no feature to switch the default language.,1
"my first language is russian but my phone is set to english, so the app is also in english which makes it really inconvenient to learn.",1
"it's so useful but i have a major problem, none of the listening tracks play on my phone so i can't answer them, by the way i gave all the permissions, what should i do?",1
this is very nice but my only problem is i can't find friends.,1
i notice that some things aren't explained clearly.,1
"a few things here and there that aren't exactly translated right, but i'd like to think it's more of a difference in dialect.",1
why suddenly the app became unstable?,1
"it messes up xp points, days, the number of lessons done and leagues.",1
i do not have access to listening and speaking tasks...,1
"great app, but it would be perfect if you'd add the grammar explanations and stories in the other languages besides german, french, english etc.",1
i do wish it would challenge me a little faster though.,1
"but in learning arabic the font of assignments is very small, difficult to read, especially for a beginner.",1
.....except that sometimes has problem with its audio system.,1
"the sound doesn't work properly most of the times unfortunatelyâ˜¹, unless the application is awesome",1
would be easier though if there was european portuguese because it's not the same as brazilian.,1
after the last update the app sometimes doesn' t count your progress.,1
also im somehow losing the gems by no means.,1
good app.... i would prefer if the app had an explaining feature towards grammar/vocab so i could better understand why the words are in the order that they are etc.,1
i updated my app but there is no sound for vocall quizzes when u tape the sound tape,1
"great app, really helpful ðŸ˜‰ don't think the hearts are necessary though.",1
"it's a good app for learn basic vocabulary, but it's just work on the beginner level.",1
"for spme reason they make a lousy japanese course, not even covering all the hiranga and giving zero lessons for katakana which is essential to learning japanese... you need to have some kind of 3rd party study aid for these and other asian courses if you want to learn them in depth and not just play a game (>.>) be it a text book, charachter chart, etc, which is totally unnecessary.",1
"there are better apps for asia but if you're interested in a european language, this application is a must have!",1
"pretty good, except the first time i downloaded it, i disabled it because it wasn't working very good...",1
duolingo is a great app for learning a new language but you have to pay in order to continue learning without any interuptions like hearts or ads.,1
"good app, just takes too long to get to an intermediate/senior level for when you already know basics and want to learn more complex sentances.",1
just wish it had dark mode for those late night sessions before bed.,1
"it didn't didn't hello with grammar, just sentence structure.",1
i love this app but but there are some things i don't like about this app.when i get things wrong my heart goes down and later i have none so its hard to play sometimes.,1
"the app is great and i'm learning 2 languages at one time, but the adds are a little ridiculous at times.",1
"it's a little childish, and i wish i was learning more useful language for traveling, but i bet that'll come.",1
might be better if the developers add some more exercises to practice speaking.,1
good app but does not explain the grammar rules.,1
requires a little research outside of the app to progress in some of the lessons.,1
mixed voices.,1
get annoyed with the rewards though.,1
app wont work with android device?,1
"- samsung galaxy 8 i'd love to provide a 5 star review, but as technical support doesn't seem to be able to get my account to work on android devices (which is what i have) i cant use the product i purchased.",1
same here the program today started to glitch i cannot access my plan.,1
i had to sign in again and looks like all my progress saved is gone.,1
"also the audio was struggling to use either with wired headphones, bluetooth or just my phones microphone.",1
it's stuck in offline mode.,1
"excellent, but needs an option to reset all lessons, not just one at a time which is too cumbersome when wanting to restart after a period away",1
in the past you could slow the pronunciation.,1
mostly good only issue that i'm having is occationaly the app/ or phone is not picking up what i say,1
a little pricey but helps a lot.,1
i'd say getting a brand new phone or using a good microphone would indefinitely help.,1
"i only wish that it would explain the grammar more, as in why the grammar is different i certain situations.",1
it's a bit frustrating when it doesn't recognize the word i'm trying to say though.,1
good app for learning but it costs a lot .,1
a four only in that it is immersive and having a tough time connecting the dots.,1
some hints on pluarity and diction in early stages might help in particular with non-euro based language.,1
"easy to learn, good for beginners but would be good if you didn't need to repeat activities if you got them all correct in the core activities!",1
i love the experience and the ability to learn from this app the only thing i wish was different is for there to be a way to earn more lessons or even just the ability to get the lessons cheaper.,1
the voice recognition needs improvement though.,1
it is very good but all of it needs to be free.,1
communication should be free!,1
but i wish you let your users try until they get it correct.,1
wish i could repeat it over and over to ensure retention.,1
very good but its a bit annoying u have to pay,1
i am not able to find the option to change from beginner to intermediate on my app.,1
the audio analysis is great at telling you when you've not pronounced a word correctly however it's not great at helping you improve.,1
"great app, bit expensive and it is limited in that once you've done the 20 units that's it, nothing more.",1
i think you need both as grammar isn't really explained.,1
tried to sign up on their website but due to some glitch could subscribe.,1
contacted customer service but what seemed to me an automated reply.,1
overall app is good but expensive and limited.,1
"a bit on the expensive side, but if you can get a half price deal i'd say it's worth it.",1
one criticism is that the reading lessons in unit one are so ridiculously easy they feel like a waste of time,1
"i made an account for the japanese unit and my only issues is sometimes, the voice lessons don't work and you have to restart the app.",1
the other issue is that you can only do unit 1 without paying money.,1
"i got it to learn more english welll and work on my pronounciation, so far i think it is working, the only down side is that you can't log onto another device until you log out in your other device.",1
i use this app with my laptop the most and there has been instances where i forgets to log out and can't use the app during my lunch at work on my phone or tablet.,1
i don't like that it can't be opened on multiple devices.,1
most pertain to speaking.,1
"unless you have a professional level microphone, it will tell you that you failed the first time, but upon saying the word or phrase a second time, it will say you got it 100% correct.",1
"i do wish there was more help with pronunciation, like if i get a word wrong repetitively, i'd like to be given the option for extra phonics help.",1
"i use duolingo along with this, because being able to write(type) out words helps me learn them and that is one thing this app is missing.",1
"also would be nice to have a ""general grammer rule"" section to refrence for help.",1
"i like it a lot and it is really helpful to visualize and pronounce these words, but without telling you the definitions it can be difficult.",1
but some lessons seem not optimized for phone size as pictures seem too small or mis alligned with caption bubbles.,1
also seems to miss some of the desktop apps features like character selection.,1
for japanese there did not seem to be a way to toggle to only hiragana and katagana.,1
i wish they also translated what it all meant weather just have us guess ??,1
the only reason the app is not five stars is because every once in a while it won't register my voice.,1
so i either fail or have to say a phrase or word multiple times for it to register.,1
"i do feel like the multiple choice makes it easy to make educated guesses, but maybe it works out in the long run.",1
i seem to have some issues though between syncing.,1
"every time i open the app it says congratulations on finishing week, even though i'm on week 3. there's a button that takes me to my latest though so it's not too much of a bother, but still weird.",1
the speech recognition is spotty though.,1
"more interactive, work on conversation actually saying the words, like the speaking analyser so know saying it right.",1
just need to have short note why something right or wrong answer in grammar.,1
the program has a difficult time with speech recognition during exercises requiring me to respond verbally.,1
"but it'd be better if there were basic alphabets of the languages, plus, the words' translation (from pictures) into our selected native language.",1
recognition skills develop quickly but pronunciation skills need more work.,1
i am learning vietnamese some of the words don't mean the same thing.,1
it said that ong and ba is an older man or woman but i was corrected and told it's elderly man or woman.,1
it would be better for me if it focused on recreational words and phrases since my trip is for fun not business but it works,1
having a slight issue with the speech recognition but overall i love the new format.,1
some thumbnail photos are too small to be easily understood on a phone screen.,1
"good simple bite size learning you can fit around your day, hard to work out if the voice recognition issues are my microphone or the software.",1
"great app, little pricey but worth it!!!",1
4 stars only because the mobile doesn't include noweigen as an option yet!,1
"works pretty well on the mobile app, just the occasional issue having to repeat into the mic.",1
would like more of a word to picture game for beginners.,1
i started using this app to learn japanese for travel but i'm having issues fully understanding it just because it doesn't actually directly translate and tell me what each word means,1
seems to have trouble picking up my accent/tone.,1
i get some pronunciations correct but it says i did not.,1
"the teaching method is great, my only complaint is that there's not an easy way to review if you get out of the habit of studying.",1
"would like to see the games available via pc on the app; otherwise, works as described!",1
"very good, albeit phone mic sometime gets drowned out by fan and other common ambient noise",1
"i love it except that the acuracy bar doesnt display when you replay words your struggling with, wich make me struggle more.",1
sometimes voice detection hangs/lags making me repeat the phrase or word.,1
too much kanji for the first lesson.,1
prefer more hiragana and katakana.,1
i turned off the microphone and now it doesn't enable it anymore.,1
syncing between multiple devices needs to get a little better but overall good,1
this is a good language app but it takes too long to load.,1
"i say the words, and it says, i said it wrong, idk what that's all about.",1
good app sometimes lags behind and appears to get stuck occasionally but otherwise very useful,1
its dope and kinda fun but i really wish it could have nothing but argentine accent... but fun 2ay to learn spanish...like i wish i could have an argentina setting ya know,1
awesome so far but wish it had more free content.,1
some of the pictures are hard to make out.,1
other than the price of subscription it's perfect,1
excellent except the voice recognition is touchy,1
its great tho the words need to be pronounced more clearly!,1
doesn't really give the translation,1
although a great app i wish it wasn't so expensive :(,1
pretty good for learning vietnamese although some prior knowledge of the language may be necessary,1
"it's too fast for a novice..please allow more time on pronunciation and grammer other than that, it's grrr-eat!",1
right now a four just started simple but still a little slow when learning spanish,1
lost progress on phone.,1
i wish i could unlock the full version but it is too expensive.,1
i need to log in every lesson,1
doesn't have all the features/lessons web does,1
i think this app should add the meanings of the words before letting us say them,1
"it's slow, but fun.",1
good program but more like guessing game.,1
doesn't teach what i am exactly saying or grammar syntax etc.,1
the app is good just wish there was a latvian course then it would be 5 stars,1
