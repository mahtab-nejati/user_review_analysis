rosettastone,1,1,i have no other accounts.
rosettastone,1,11,absolutely terrible in every way.
rosettastone,1,3,c. children.
rosettastone,1,1,"arabic grammar is probably the most complicated of all languages, yet no grammar, no vocabulary."
rosettastone,1,2,admit
rosettastone,1,1,terrible experience.
rosettastone,1,16,but a picture is worth a thousand words.
rosettastone,1,30,the pronunciation exercises are really irritating.
rosettastone,1,0,does not pick up your voice very well.
rosettastone,1,1,no motivation step or anything to direct me to my subscription.
rosettastone,1,1,incredibly frustrated by this pp and getting nowhere with customer support.
rosettastone,1,1,"was wrapped by misleading ad for ""free"" trial."
rosettastone,1,0,"when you're to repeat word(s) that you have no clue as to what that spanish word(s) mean, but are expected to choose from the images that describe what you're saying?!?!"
rosettastone,1,13,considering the cost the lessons are rather bland and not very useful from a practical language usage.
rosettastone,1,0,have used other applications and they have no problems recognizing my words.
rosettastone,1,0,i also take one on one lessons and my teacher even has no issues with how i pronounce words.
rosettastone,1,0,not user friendly.
rosettastone,1,3,speech recognition is horrible.
rosettastone,1,0,doesn't help pronounce all words!!!
rosettastone,1,0,i wouldn't be at all surprised if this was managed by a root.
rosettastone,1,0,"sides load to fast not giving you ability to pause things and really understand, there are wrong word meanings which is a no no for a language leaving pp."
rosettastone,1,7,also its not free
rosettastone,1,6,"this used to be a great pp, but forget passing any pronunciation tasks with it."
rosettastone,1,31,if you're a beginner i wouldn't dare touch this.
rosettastone,1,31,for beginners even advanced i'd say no unless you have extra cash around and want to strengthen some minor points.. maybe.. i have no clue why this sold so much.
rosettastone,1,26,"i no your going to reply wit dynamic immersion, i can watch the spanish channel for dynamic immersion for free."
rosettastone,1,0,of makes learning fun by turning it into a sort of game where you compete against others.
rosettastone,1,0,no free lessons.
rosettastone,1,0,no!
rosettastone,1,2,"unlike every single free pp i've used, this pp only provides words in first script.. there is no english alphabet entering to help with pronunciation eg ""salem"" for سلام."
rosettastone,1,0,only the first 4 are free.
rosettastone,1,4,terrible experience .
rosettastone,1,8,these people are crazy.
rosettastone,1,0,there no way to learn with these lessons.
rosettastone,2,1,just practically flash cards.
rosettastone,2,8,no!!!
rosettastone,2,2,speech recognition is horrible?
rosettastone,2,1,"nice concept, intuition execution."
rosettastone,2,1,very sluggish pace.
rosettastone,2,0,i work my way 3/4 through core.
rosettastone,2,9,"last, but not least, i cannot switch the user interface language."
rosettastone,2,0,"not worth paying for, there are programs that are just as effective but with smaller price tags."
rosettastone,2,0,concepts are not.
rosettastone,2,0,my accent and vocabulary are really improving!
rosettastone,2,0,i got a better experience with top 1 pp.
rosettastone,3,1,a picture can tell many stories.
rosettastone,3,0,slow loading at times but fun
rosettastone,3,0,good and exciting when needed
rosettastone,3,0,not by itself !
rosettastone,3,5,"since it does not teach language principles, you learn slowly and are literally being babies along."
rosettastone,3,0,i don't like guessing at what the sentences are saying.
rosettastone,3,0,it runs smoothly but want consistent enough.
rosettastone,3,38,"lessons are good, but there is not very much repetition of previous lessons once a unit has been completed."
rosettastone,3,38,not sure why is doesn't emphasize repetition more.
rosettastone,3,0,photo are nice to describe nous but some profound are confusing and i need to research outside program to find definitions.
rosettastone,3,28,very intuition.
rosettastone,3,0,was offered a few introductory lessons free.if i had no basic spanish it would be difficult for me to match the conversation with the pictures as no english is used and words are not defined.
rosettastone,3,0,this pp helps in learning any language very easily.
rosettastone,4,1,are.
rosettastone,4,4,"st core lesson is great, but spoken voice is much too fast."
rosettastone,4,1,there are no specific grammar theory lessons as most things tend to make perfect sense with this conceptual learning approach.
rosettastone,4,1,"it judges your pronunciation and asks you to repeat things, as well as flash cards with visual and hearing and spelling."
rosettastone,4,16,lessons are interactive.
rosettastone,4,0,it uses repetition to help understand the language.
rosettastone,4,1,the exercises are interesting and helpful.

rosettastone,4,1,great pp takes u step by step in each lesson.
rosettastone,4,0,interactive and fun but sometimes it clashes
rosettastone,4,3,i can feel my brain making associations.
rosettastone,4,20,how this is set up can be rather greeting or intense.
rosettastone,4,44,other than that i have no complaints at all.
rosettastone,4,0,i enjoy learning phrases instead of just individual words at a time.
rosettastone,4,0,communication should be free!
rosettastone,4,0,my phone doesn't capture my pronunciation very well but the lesson was clear and easy to follow.
rosettastone,4,0,good pronunciation drills.
rosettastone,4,0,interactive and information .
rosettastone,4,0,good job with having you repeat words so you retain it with images.
rosettastone,4,0,works smoothly.
rosettastone,4,4,"a little frustration, however, i'm absolutely sure, it doesn't hurt to practice my pronunciation over & over, ll!"
rosettastone,4,8,"even though there are no direct translations, it's easy to pick up on what's going on by looking at the pictures and noticing patterns."
rosettastone,4,0,i mean using pictures to teach vocabulary is great but i think learning grammar will be much clearer and less ambiguous if learned directly and then aided with visual rather than having them figured out solely from pictures.
rosettastone,4,4,i love this pp but i wish that there was more organization with tense that go along with each verb.
rosettastone,4,2,"thankful, it doesn't prevent you from progressing through the lessons by not passing them."
rosettastone,4,51,"i have lots more comments, no space to write."
rosettastone,4,0,"not complicated once engaged, and defiantly allows to learn at your own pace"
rosettastone,4,5,marvelous interactive pp.
rosettastone,4,0,especially considering i have no previous experience in makarin.
rosettastone,4,0,"so far works great at voice recognition, not really clot of english explanations, but i believe its favoring pronunciation and a degree of memory associations between calling out singular subjects and multiple."
rosettastone,4,0,great pace and carefully put together.
rosettastone,4,0,"avoids the ""tourist"" phrases and uses every day phrases."
rosettastone,4,0,only comment: not sure what you are buying when subscribing!

rosettastone,4,0,needs more interactive conversation
rosettastone,4,0,very intuition and comprehensive.
rosettastone,4,0,it's fun but i'm not sure i'm retaining a lot of the words but i'm not sure if that is the goal with this learning
rosettastone,4,0,no translations but other than that is good

rosettastone,5,1,"the pp is all about repetition so that at some points, the words stick in your head quite naturally."
rosettastone,5,52,i only thing i had to goose was some help with masculine and feminine words.
rosettastone,5,2,i love this program so much because not only does it teach you how to read and say the words but emphasized on pronunciation as well.
rosettastone,5,2,adding pictures to the words for association is absolutely the top layer of sprinkled one needs to learn effectively.
rosettastone,5,103,"also, might i just say that your pp design is pretty intuition, easy to navigable, because of it's rather sleek interface."
rosettastone,5,0,"this pp is an excellent addition to the desktop application, allowing study to continue when not at home."

rosettastone,5,48,you can set your own level of difficulty for the pronunciation which provides a real personal challenge and learning curve.
rosettastone,5,47,"i've tried domingo, which is free, but roseola stone tests your pronunciation much more accurately, and introduces new words by building on existing phrases that you've learned, which is a much more realistic and immersion way of learning than learning individual words in isolation of phrases."
rosettastone,5,2,a lot more fun and interactive for me as an adult compared to when i was learning as a child.
rosettastone,5,2,especially with pronunciation cubs.
