duolingo,5,241,"brilliant pp, only a few minutes a day, easy to fit into your day, very happy at how quickly i've been able to brush up on my french. very efficient way of learning... french to english translations, english to french, listening to french pronunciation, missing words and practicing tense. i know loads of people, young and older, who are trying the pp. huge language option. i like it that you can set up how many minutes a day i want to practise."
duolingo,5,56,"if you give it serious time (not 5 minutes a day like they advertise, but more like an hour or two daily), this learning method actually works well to get you started with a language. the gazing mechanics keeps you coming back for more, it's fun to compete on the leaderboards and in a couple of months you'll start to understand and maybe even basically speak another language!"
duolingo,5,25,"amazing learning tool for those who want to set a foundation for learning a language, me personally chose russian and i feel like i am learning a good amount, you just need to dedicate time and effort, i also recommend tiny cards and then follow the language you're learning to help practice and perfect the language of your choice. hopefully i will have russian killed in eventually. just need to put in the work. overall, great free pp and i love domingo!!!"
duolingo,5,1,"love this pp. i've tried at least a dozen others, and every one of them would only let you progress so far, or do so many lessons, before having to subscribe. i've been able to access everything i've worked towards, and had clot of fun doing it. i would, and have, recommend domingo to anyone looking to learn another language."
duolingo,5,0,"so far, so good. i am still in the beginning/into, so i dont know how much will be locked behind pay walls, but it's great to refresh basic spanish skill. the little owl us so cut and encouraging that even as an adult, i feel like i'm making progress. my only complaint would be that it is spain spanish, which is different from mexican spanish, but it's definitely a starting point."
duolingo,5,119,"fantastic! it's such a fun way to learn a language, i absolutely love the story telling addition and the little details everywhere. it works, i went from 0 french to pretty much somewhat proficient, and i still got a long way to go to finish the course! adds are very fairly placed and completely unobtrusive on the free version as well, thank you domingo! this is an pp clearly made by a developer who cares. russian, you're next ;) i just wish each lesson was a bit longer though."
duolingo,5,10,"a wonderful and revolutionary pp. making fun out of learning through ratification. wonderful use of visual and audit clues. does a great job keeping you engaged and interested and it really works. wonderful to use before to study up for trip abroad. where's the pp that makes learning history, path, or other subjects fun?! thank you for your service and helping those who commit to continuous learning and growth."
duolingo,5,6,"i am conversational in japanese. however, this domingo pp is teaching me words, phrases and some structure that is new to me in the language. also, i use this pp to learn the written language (anti). which i am really enjoying!! this pp is not just for beginners. those of us who speak the language can benefit as well. thank you domingo !"
duolingo,5,3,"this offers opportunities to learn in many different style. between needing to speak it, having to translate it both ways and needing to write what you hear. it build on top of itself at a good place incorporating words from past lesson and incorporating new words in an easy to understand concept. i am excited to use this pp to learn as i move to south florida and hope to become client by end of the year."
duolingo,5,3,"an excellent language pp. fun to use. each lesson has tips which are useful. lessons depend on the category chosen & can be phrases in your home language & the language you are learning, write what you have heard, speak the phrase or word, enter missing words, vocabulary. it is an easy way to learn a language & you move up or down in leagues pitted against each other. see which languages others are learning. complete as little or more daily or less frequently, easy to pick up again."
duolingo,5,11,"wonderful pp. makes learning a new language a since, even better than university and much cheaper! courses are $600 for 4 months while i paid $66 for 6 months and i learn on my own time. plus no exam! many different exercises to help you learn rules and lots of repetition to help memories the material. the pp makes it fun like a game. much easier to learn than babel. i speak 3 languages already and i plan on learning 2 more after this fourth one because the pp is so easy and fun."
duolingo,5,4,"great pp. i am learning spanish and it is really helping. i struggle with profound and this is really helping me. the lessons have a nice mix of reading, listening and writing. and the progression is nice and slow. i had to download a dual language keyboard so i do the writing properly. i can wait to go to spain and practice what i've learnt"
duolingo,5,4,the pp uses just the right amount of one's base language to get you started. then one hardly notices english even when you're doing a translation exercise. it has an element of multiple choice exercises. it can be very easy if one sticks to it and just demanding enough to make learning a language a pleasure. at one point it replaced solitary as my go to pp when on 20 minute bus rides my advice to all is to bite off what you can chew. chew it over by a little real world practise.
duolingo,5,2,"very nice pp! i'd like to point out a few suggestions i personally would like to experience in the future inside your pp: one is to be able to search for a word's meaning (you remember a word in german for example, but you're not sure about its meaning..), and second thing is to be able to see all the words you have learned so far, with its translation beside (all=all..) other than that, appreciate your work, useful pp! thank you!"
duolingo,5,8,"in all honesty the adds get annoying. but for a free pp, that genuinely reaches you the language and how to spell and pronounce things correctly. it is great. there really are no shortcuts and you have to stick with it. if you want to learn a language you can. this pp is great and makes it easy to get into your routine. just beware of the owl if you leave your modifications on. he will remind you. quick update: i wish it told you how many minutes and hours total you have been practicing."
duolingo,5,1,"best and most information language learning pp. i have been using it for a couple years to learn swahili. it has been improved over the years to be more user friendly and accurate to the languages they offer. i never get bored of it! the interface is fun and game-like, and you actually will be amazed at how much of your chosen language you begin to retain and grow client in! i would recommend dealing to anyone wishing to learn a language."
duolingo,5,1,"i am having fun regarding on learning a different language. it really uplifts the mood and makes a very efficient time killer. 5/5 even with the as, it's not a bother and some have like a benefit on the long run like extra gems. i won't say that a premium version is obsolete but rather i would like my language tutor to be as free as possible given the fact that different language materials and tutorials are scarce on the internet these day and age. wonderful pp thank you des!"
duolingo,5,7,"this hands down! the best pp i've ever download! i'm learning several languages, and domingo makes it easy and fun! you get weekly updated on your progress, there's a store where you can buy stuff with the gems you earn...all this with the free version! i'm seriously considering upbraiding to the pay version because, if the free version is so great, i bet the upgrade is even better! as are not irritating and easy to close, too. highly recommend!!!"
duolingo,5,1,"i love this pp. i have been using the free version for 2 weeks and have learnt so much already. it reaches you how to read, write and speak the language in a way that's fun and easy and encourages you to keep going. you can also clock stories which help with your reading and listening. couldn't recommend enough for someone who wants to learn a new language"
duolingo,5,2,"easy and engaging to use. i'm on day 7 and can already recognize arabic letters and the sounds they make! i'm old so it is exciting that my brain is learning so easily with domingo! i like setting my own goals, and am very happy that there are plenty of practice sessions included with my plus version. i highly recommend this pp."
duolingo,5,0,"i really like the pp as additional practice method. combined with a proper course and book for grammar it's a great tool to study whenever you got a few free minutes. i would recommend to try it, if you want to learn a language, the i still suggest to use other sources, like books, native speakers and courses, as well."
duolingo,5,1,"this is still a great language pp. although it doesn't explain certain rules out exceptions so if you're serious about learning another language it's best to have a book or some other more detailed information to hand. however, i would recommend this to anyone wanting to either learn, or just find it about another language."
duolingo,5,1,"i have been using the pp for a week and so far is good. learning is broke up in different categories and uses repetition and adding the old stuff into the new stuff to remember the words. i am learning spanish and german and slowly starting italian. with many option, it's easy to learn a new language at your own pace."
duolingo,5,11,"i think domingo is absolutely wonderful and helpful. i've been learning spanish for a few weeks now and the is so much content that i have covered. many of the reviews mention the 5 live system and i believe it's a great thing because there is also a 'practice' section which makes you revise what you have learnt in order to get lives. although it's time consuming, it tests your knowledge and ensures that you are learning as much as possible."
duolingo,5,1,"this pp is very fun and educational. it makes learning a new language easy and fun! when i lose all my lives, i just want to keep going! and i also appreciate the pp being free, along with all the languages and lessons! and there aren't many as either! i would give you 100 stars if i could. i really appreciate this pp."
duolingo,5,1,i learned a lot from this pp. gracious. this pp is the best to learn a certain language. i hope that you will have a vocabulary words so that we can review some of the words if we are not up to answering questions. the books of the pp is also very helpful. thank you so much for making this pp free and giving us opportunity to learn a language easily!!!❤❤
duolingo,5,0,"i use this application as a supplement to broader self-study tools, to reinforce grammar concepts and pronunciation. it works incredibly well to foster a deeper understanding and more natural learning curve of the language being studied. incredible pp, and so grateful that it's all at no cost!"
duolingo,5,3,"it is an amazing pp. a little expensive for premium, but if you can ignore the adds it's awesome just using the free version. i feel like you will definitely need more than just this pp to learn a language, but it definitely will get you on your way to an intermediate level. it's fun, easy to use, and gets the into in your head, so i rate this 5 stars. it also has a small competitive aspect to it that i have really enjoyed."
duolingo,5,0,"well, it is not a bad application... i mean, it is too similar to a game but if you pay attention and follow the advice the pp itself gives (read each lesson out loud and write the new vocabulary you learn after practicing), then you will probably get the basic knowledge such as sounds and simple vocabulary. so, it is recommended to beginners but you can't stop here."
duolingo,5,1,"i love it. especially for a free pp there is lots of content so i don't feel the pressure to upgrade just yet. one thing i would like to change is how they teach grammar rules. it seems like they only test you, but never give you a lesson beforehand. so you end up just blandly guessing until there has been enough repetition that you catch on to the rules."
duolingo,5,1,"the best pp on my phone. good difficulty curves, content and it is overall very cleverly written pp. i only wish they expand the section with stories and maybe at some level make the stories into audit-so you have to listen to a few paragraphs and answer questions based on what you heard."
duolingo,5,2,it is an extremely useful pp if you want to learn any language correctly and practically. it isn't just about the written part of the language but also pronunciation and phrase forming. the method of teaching is great and subtly repetition which helps memories very quickly. i absolutely recommend this pp for new earners of any language.
duolingo,5,1,"i love this pp, i only wish sometimes there was more guidance and explanation on specific things. i usually end up having to look things up for myself, but that doesn't bring my rating down because without the pp i wouldn't be knowing what i had to look up in the first place edit: i forgot to mention that i love the webster more than the pp, if the pp was more like the webster that would be epic"
duolingo,5,4,"i would highly recommend this as a method of learning a second language. it is engaging, fun and effective. the repetition is very helpful for retaining new vocabulary and hearing the sentences is great for learning pronunciation. i have learnt more grammar in a very short period than i have with other language learning software."
duolingo,5,18,"this has been a great way for me to brush up on my language skill. i love the extra components like the podcast and the stories that are interactive. it has become a daily ritual for me and i don't see myself falling out of practice any time soon. the only buggy thing for me are the pronunciation exercises. i'm not sure if it's how i am holding my phone, if my mouth is too close to the microphone or what but it gets disheartening ""failing"" those activities with no help in how to correct."
duolingo,5,0,"love domingo and my portuguese is getting so much better! don't know what happened though but after one of the recent updated i can't recorder the words in word bank mode anymore. also the tests to skin a level are sometimes too easy with most translations providing the word bank! other than that, this pp is absolutely great! (wish there was a portuguese from italian! the two languages are so similar and it would be much easier to learn being italian my first language!)"
duolingo,5,0,"amazing pp, easy to use, huge variety of languages to learn, doesn't overwhelm you. i love that you can not only access it on your phone but also on a computer. extremely simple to use, i love how it works with your pace. i can't recommend this pp enough, nor can i express how much i love this pp."
duolingo,5,0,"very nice pp. it's really adjective and if you are competitive person you have to be careful. there are a lot of things that might be useful if you are learning new language. it is easy, funny and useful. highly recommended this pp when you are learning either at home or outside."
duolingo,5,0,this surely is the best free language learning pp available. it makes learning real easy and fun. it has as but at a minimal but you don't have to watch them so its not bothering you. plus it keeps you motivate and its just amazing. you can set the bar low but when you start you almost dont want to quit. so in my opinion its definitely worth a try!
duolingo,5,5,"domingo is fun and interactive. i have been using this pp almost daily for over a year now and i am comfortably starting to converse with my spanish-speaking patients. i love how many different ways of learning it includes. it appeals to my hands-on learning style and the visual eye. there is lots of positive feedback, encouragement, and rewards. domingo is helping me meet my language goals in a very positive atmosphere."
duolingo,5,0,"loving this so far! i'm 31, and hard of hearing failed french in school because i was unable to hear certain sounds / so reporting it back i was always wrong. i find this so much different i put my earphones in and i'm able to fully hear the sounds, and therefore i've been able to repeat it back correctly. it's nice being able to learn something that i was told i would be unable to do. and now at the age of 31 i have friends who are french so i have even more of a reason to really try to learn"
duolingo,5,0,"organ lessons are getting much better. it would be great if the pp would do a better job when listening to me speak (sometimes i really mess it up and it can't tell) but otherwise awesome! overall though, i'm generally really happy with it."
duolingo,5,0,"comprehensive. the little lightbulb icon next to the individual skill (on some interface, instead of a lightbulb it's ""tips"") provide lessons (grammar etc.), giving it great structure. wide selection of languages. i use it every day and makes learning languages enjoyable. can't believe it's free, i highly recommend! (:"
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is a great pp for learning, absolute 5 stars, its great, i love it, the lessons are very intriguing and i love, just love the cut little animation on the lessons, when i'm doing my japanese lessons, i always loved the lessons little pictures, but those little animation are perfect! yes. but one thing, i wish japanese lessons had stories, it would make everything so much more interesting!"
duolingo,5,1,"i love the pp because it is friendly towards you and i have already after 15+ minutes learnt a fair bit about german! i have always wanted to learn german and now that i am, it feels great! this pp isn't time consuming and you can get on and off of it at any time you feel comfortable, and depending on how often you use the pp, you could learn a whole new language in no time! i highly recommend this pp to anyone who would like to learn a new language! :)"
duolingo,5,0,"was expecting something that gave u the basis them u had to pay to go on, so happy this isn't the case! it's really good and allows a varied method of teaching , i love the competition with up and story mode. so helpful for learning a language. it unlocked new material as u go on so i don't feel overwhelmed with words but a fast enough teaching pace to develop with. best pp for this i've found."
duolingo,5,0,i am really enjoying the ratified experience domingo brings to learning a new language. i appreciate that it has the listening and speaking parts so strongly integrated into the lessons. i'm impressed that it can hear me speaking even in noisy situations. a very enjoyable pp.
duolingo,5,0,"i started using domingo just over 30 days ago and am quite impressed with the format and intuition nature of the program, as well as the additional materials such as podcast to enhance and enrich the learning. i am very happy with this pp thus far."
duolingo,5,0,"very good pp except for some reason computer experience seems more thorough. get stories for japanese! sometimes you want a bit more emphasis on the lists of words you've already learnt, and it would be nice to understand the different numbers next to surnames on the forum."
duolingo,5,3,this pp is great for learning a language their are such a small amount of as it never others you and besides you choose when you watch video as for doubling stuff like gems or hearts. some people hate the hearts in this game you get 5 every 25 hours and each time you mess up in a lesson it takes away a heart. when you run out of hearts you fail that level of the lesson and have to red it which i am perfectly fine with as you can do practice lessons for more hearts. helping you too learn!!
duolingo,5,0,"a wonderful learning platform.......step by step lessons.....enough of practice to make you remember everything that you have learnt.....it reaches you reading, writing, speaking, listening, all of them.....and the best is all of this is completely free......must use pp"
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is simplistic in approach, but that simplicity by no means a detriment. its design makes learning a fun and easy experience with achievement milestones to track your progress and a subtle aspect of competition by way of leaderboards that display others' progress and banking. domingo makes you want to learn more, to progress, to better your understanding of whatever languages you choose to learn in a brilliant fashion. buds to the creator!"
duolingo,5,0,"i never expected that learning a new language could be this fun! i don't use it often, mostly before sleeping, but it's fun to learn the new language to prepare myself for trips or when i encounter a random spanish person (guess what language i'm trying to learn). i also see some reviews complaining about the ""new"" hearts system. bull i say, it has always been there!"
duolingo,5,19,"brilliant pp. free and easy to use. does have as but they are very short. great content and easy to learn, tests your skill on speaking, listening and writing the language. i'm learning french at the moment but there is loads of languages you can learn and learn several at once. you earn up when learning which takes you up the leaderboard against other people. i highly recommend this pp as i've learned so much already!"
duolingo,5,2,"i've compared other apes to this one and i'd love to say, bravo! i have not learned much but i get words in my head quickly unlike the others. it doesn't usually crash and it's got good speed! and i like it that you can study like 5 languages at the same time not like the other apes. спасибо!"
duolingo,5,5,"i think this pp is very helpful. i studied makarin in college for 4 years, and this gave me an aptitude test to clock lessons starting with my level of proficient so i did not have to start from the beginning (i still did for review's sake, but it was nice that i did not have to). this helps me keep my makarin decent, and it reaches me some phrases they did not teach in school. i also appreciate that it helps me with my reading quite a bit."
duolingo,5,14,"fun and information application for solo learning, complete with vocabulary, grammar, audit clips, conversations, stories, and statistics for friendly competition between other students. better than public school! best part is that this is free and the as are not intrusion. thank you for making language studies accessible and free across the globe!"
duolingo,5,17,"lately i am once again falling in love with domingo. i love this last update! the fact that the keyboard switch automatically is a really good way of saving time, especially when you have more than 10 keyboard to chose from. finally they changed the number of lessons too! it was a bit annoying having to do 20 lessons to complete one level. and i love the podcasts, learning french has become more easier for me, that i was struggling a bit with the similarity to spanish. absolutely advised!"
duolingo,5,2,lui it.. such a wonderful pp❤️.... which helps me to understand the concepts very easily.... and it also sends me reminder modifications which reminds me most of the time..!! tax to domingo i suggest that many pp can use this pp and learn many languages! domingo also provides us the interest of learning a new language. do the best learning pp for languages..!
duolingo,5,0,"great pp to learn almost any language you would think of. it's completely for free which is amazing. you will just see few adds which is completely understandable (or you can pay to not see them). i love the learning system, lessons, everything. also the domingo forum is amazing help. thank you so much!"
duolingo,5,0,"simple to use pp. the ease of use makes it fun for me to learn a new language. the leaderboards make it competitive so i am always logging in to see if i'm still top three. there are as, but they are short and easy to exit out of once one pips up. i would recommend this pp to anyone who wants to earn a new language."
duolingo,5,0,"i really love this pp soon much, aside from the fact that learning is free i can learn many different languages in this pp. ever since i found it in the internet on ways to make your time more worth it using my phone. it makes my learning easy than any other up. it reaches how to write, pronounce, how to contract a word and many more 💓 i highly recommend it to all the people i know through out these past 5 years 😁 thank you so much domingo team!! 💯💓"
duolingo,5,411,"amazing pp that is so easy to utilize. there are so many many different style of puzzled to truly help the learner understand the structure of the language. amazing! update (01/07/2020). i still give this pp 5 stars. having stayed diligent in learning spanish with domingo, i have truly picked up the basis of the language, making me able to write basic sentences with ease. honestly, i can't believe it's free, this is high quality stuff!"
duolingo,5,25,"this pp has been wonderful so far. they do such a good job not overwhelming you with too much material at once. the lessons are short(2-3 minutes) but you can complete several in a row if you desire. even in free mode, there is exactly 1 ad at the end of each lesson, and you don't have to wait 5, 15, or 30 seconds to close it, you can x right away. that shows class (ll), integrity, and a education to learning from the developer. i was offered a week trial of domingo plus, will def porch."
duolingo,5,3,love using this pp. i've been able to practice pronunciation of swedish which turns out to be my favourite language right now. i love that you can learn a number of languages at the same time and you get these non intrusion reminders which are helpful. i recommend this pp to anyone who wants to get into new languages.
duolingo,5,0,"love the independence this pp gives me in actually learning another language. it's strength are definitely in reading and listening to the language since there's only so much chatting you can do with ai, but that's something! i am finding myself per up to and decipher words and sentences of spanish speakers when i am out and about in a regular basis. very rewarding. and the learning is relatively painless since it is set up as a game."
duolingo,5,0,"i would say i have been using this pp for more than 5 years(if i'm not mistaken), so i enjoy this opportunity, firstly, you learn while having fun, secondly, it is free and quantitative, thirdly, i love it's log(that lovely owl) i feel like it is my pet and reminding me to improve myself, love you do😍😍😙😙"
duolingo,5,0,"this is a great pp for learning languages that are maybe from your culture, school, or multiple more other things. i was on this pp of only 3 days and know way more than what i originally did. i love how it prounouces it, and gives you tips. so, if your wanting to experience or learn a language domingo is perfect for you!"
duolingo,5,0,"this pp is so easy and fun. it sounds like i'm advertising, but i'm actually british and historically, we're lazy to learn new language scared of trying - my main issue. however, domingo has made this process painless and accessible. i recommend to all that need or want to learn another language. go for it!"
duolingo,5,6,"i never thought i'd be able to stick to language learning, but this pp is definitely next level when it comes to dopamine hits and fun game-like incentive to continue and beat those you're in competition with. it truly feels like a fun video game, and in the meantime, you see clear and consistent language learning progress. once i get competent in polish, i'm going to start another language, and then maybe another after that!"
duolingo,5,1,"domingo has been a great tool for me to learn spanish at my own speed. there are many times i am not able their stay with my several days streak however, i always have the option of going back and starting with the into or phrases again if i feel i need to. i like it because i can learn at my own pace and not feel pressure."
duolingo,5,2,give only been using the pp for a few days but i have already retained a lot of the material faster than i would have thought. i was always so timid to start learning a new language even though french is always one give wanted to pick up. this pp has definitely broken those barriers for me and made it enjoyable at the same time!
duolingo,5,0,i'm really enjoying learning spanish with this pp. the only thing i'd say is it'd be nice to have a range of exercises (not just sentences) and if paring exercise was more related to the level you're at rather than genetic mix of words from all levels (usually the easier ones). thanks anyway for a great free pp
duolingo,5,1,"thank you unlike the other people complaining. i anna say thank you for creating an pp that helps you learn another language and makes it fun. it has prove to work.,very very effective. my french and japanese has increased so much but if you can please increase on the explanations (especially for japanese), that would be mighty fine. thank you again"
duolingo,5,11,"i really am enjoying the pp. it is helping me to learn new languages, with out making it boring or difficult. in only a week, i now know multiple words and phrase in another language, where as if i were to have taken a class, it would have taken almost a month to learn what i know now. the light competitiveness, mixed with achievements, helps to keep me motivate to keep going. it works with how you want to learn, with multiple difficulties and the time system."
duolingo,5,1,"i really think this pp is great. it works well and i like how its free, no random pop up as, and when you're out of hearts, you can practice to regain them. the idea is wonderful. not only that, you can have friends on it, and your own profile. it's great for learning new languages."
duolingo,5,0,"i've been using domingo (free not premium) to maintain my german & get exposed to other languages for years now. mio it's one of the best language learning resources out there, free or otherwise! i love that they've never compromised on offering their main products for free even after adding a premium version. they've ensued there's tons you can do for free & i've never felt like they've ragged me with as or limited what i can learn in order to get me to pay. can't say enough in 500 words ll"
duolingo,5,140,"i like the way it conditions you into a language and the way vocabulary is subtly introduced and repeated. it is very well-placed to accommodate different levels of earners. the structure of the pp is well thought out, like it was as written by a linguistic/teacher. the constant do motivation and reminders work well to help with time management. over all, it makes learning languages fun and gives you the opportunity to interact with other people as well, which adds a social dynamic."
duolingo,5,1,"this pp is fantastic! you learn to read, speak, and write the words! repetition, which really helps you remember! if you run low on health, you can practice to gain hearts! this pp is amazing and i recommend it to anyone wanting to learn a new language(s)! two thumbs waaaaay way up! 👍🏻👍🏻"
duolingo,5,5,"i've been an andros user for a long time, and i've never left a review on an pp so far. but this pp truly deserves all the appraisal and a full 5 stars! never have i enjoyed learning as much as i do with domingo! some people complain about the hearts system, but if you select to practice, you can both reap and earn hearts in a matter of minutes. i started my spanish lessons 2 hours ago and i'm blown away with how easy and fun it is. 6/5!!! ♥️😁"
duolingo,5,10,"this pp is truly amazing. you can learn a whole new language just by practicing everyday. you can set reminders so you don't forget as well as lose your spot on the leaderboard, where you can compete with the amount of up you have with others. the pp if free and there are minimal as, so dont worry about paying for anything. this pp is very helpful and i feel that i can become client in the language i am learning using this pp and this pp alone."
duolingo,5,0,"it is by far, the absolutely best language learning pp. i've tried many others, i just never found the right fit. this pp really did meet my needs. i wanted to learn german, but i didn't want to listen, nor speak. do never forced me to! i needed it in a story structure, while learning the vocabulary and sentence structures, so i could progress onto harder stories. this did exactly that, to my surprise. i hadn't found an pp that could do what i envisioned. violent dance!"
duolingo,5,1,"i absolutely love it! but i would like to make a suggestion: it would make it very simple for me at least if there was a dictionary of the language i'm learning in the pp. it would help with trying to remember words without having to be in lessons. other than that, i absolutely love the pp. it has helped me so much!"
duolingo,5,8,"i love games/apes that challenge you and keep your brain sharp so this is a great pp to do that and a productive way to kill time! my only suggestion is i would love to see balkan languages added (creation, serbian, and/or bosnia). other than that, very easy to use and a lot of fun! you get as on the free version but they don't bother me much."
duolingo,5,0,"phenomena! i've been using this pp for a year or two and its so educational and fun. the recently added stories are great! its still super easy to use if you don't have domingo+ , though i got it free for a week and it was nice."
duolingo,5,6,"this is so awesome that i don't mind the as. it's fun competing against people around the world, guessing where they are by their activity patterns, and what their language is. knowing the effort i've put in, it is really impressive to see the scores and variety of languages folks are pursuing. even clinton! i haven't been able to add my pick to my profile, but the world is better off for that. i recently changed phone and they had a way to get me set right back where i was. awesome."
duolingo,5,0,"providing language education for free is one of the best ideas ever. i've been using domingo with french, portuguese and german and even if i haven't become client at any of those languages (yet) i think i have got a good base of grammar and vocabulary in an entertaining way. also it includes now podcasts and other tools to help you with your listening."
duolingo,5,1,i think for a person with a bit of background on the language they learn (most importantly the alphabet in most languages and/or some of the pronunciation) this pp is a go to for you to improve your language ... not necessarily to become client but you'll be able to have basic conversations with people of the language you're learning
duolingo,5,0,"love, love, love it!!! it is easy and engaging. it covers vision and sound recognition of words and sentences. reaches practical vocabulary and use of grammar in changes of contents. makes it fun, enforcing, and easy to learn; allowing you to work at your own pace. appreciate that it encourages skill of listening, understanding, speaking, reading, and writing to gain the ability to translate in either languages. really love that you can choose up to four languages to learn concurrently."
duolingo,5,1,"edit: why did the speaking exercises disappear from the pp? i'm learning german at lightning speed! easy, fun, effective, and you can do a little here and a little there, so you're learning before you know it."
duolingo,5,0,"it is really fun. i enjoy using domingo everyday. even though i sometimes lose my streak. the strange thing is, when i'm playing a game, a domingo ad pips up. but other then that, i hope this pp really continues to do what it can to help people in learning different languages."
duolingo,5,5,"what can i say... this pp got me interested in language learning, 3 years ago i could barely say ""hello nice to meet you"" in english, now i can talk with people about a lot of different subjects, although if you want to improve your listening/pronunciation skill you have to look elsewhere, i don't know, couture is a thing, be creative with it, use the internet to learn."
duolingo,5,1,"i think you should be able to pick your gender so you know how to pronounce thing with that tone of voice because there is a difference in the way things are said by male or female, it would be nice if i could practice only hearing a female voice so i can pronounce things the way a female would in that language"
duolingo,5,1,"great pp! i used domingo as a challenge to myself and to the pp itself by choosing, what i considered, a difficult language to learn....chinese. i have learnt more than i thought i would and with such ease in a short amount of time. you can't not give it a go, you have literally nothing to lose. if it doesn't suit you, install it and no harm done, that's my thinking either way."
duolingo,5,4,"i do love this learning pp, especially the stories! love the creativity. i would like to be able to strengthen multiple skill at once and /or be able to test multiple skill at once. but that's just me using the pp as a complement to a course. for people learning a language from scratch this pp is highly recommended by yours truly."
duolingo,5,0,"i absolutely love domingo but i think it helps me learn spanish words better than it helps me learn to speak spanish. speaking exercises are great but why do they only practice repeating what was heard? why not speak the spanish translation or situation speaking in spanish? ""tell the waiter you need a table for two."" or do says: ""de que color es el vested de muter."" learner looks at a picture and answers, ""el vested de muter es room."" keep up the good work domingo!"
duolingo,5,4,"wonderful pp! fun and easy to use. great way to get hooked on learning a new language. very interactive and engaging - 100% recommended!! there are as, but surprisingly they're for things i'm actually interested in, and they are non-intrusion (they don't pop up during lessons, but only after a lesson has been completed)."
duolingo,5,8,"the pp was maybe 3.5-4 stars when i first started using it a few years ago, but it's definitely grown into a 5 star pp since. lots of expansion to the language courses, and new features like fully voice-acted (not text-to-speech) audiobook- type stories to practice listening to conversation and conceptual listening (so far only in french, spanish, and german again). very fun language learning pp that keeps you engaged and growing."
duolingo,5,2,"great pp. it's really helping me learn new languages easily, and any adds they show you are quick. when you run out of hearts, instead of saying you must wait the 4+hours for the next one, they let you practice what you've been working on to earn a heart. i love this pp"
duolingo,5,2,"i have been using this pp for about 2 weeks now and its brilliant! i've learned so many words for having just started, and i hope one day to be a fluid speaker in scottish garlic. the adds only come up when after you've done a lesson and don't come out of nowhere like some other apes can, and there is a paid version that will do away with as. i'm considering buying the pro version as i'm enjoying the pp so much. 5 stars all day long!"
duolingo,5,5,"it is the bomb!, really good for learning nous, and clot others, this reaches clot, however i prefer learning in person from teachers, they tell how to use certain words properly, other than that, amazing pp. i do advise using this as a secondary way to learn a language, this doesn't teach everything you need to know. it is even free!!! thank u all so much domingo, you guns are amazing. please keep adding learning content. is- i'm now beginning russian. please enable tips on russian, thank yale"
duolingo,5,1,"domingo is a great pp because there are so many languages to learn and you can learn more than one at a time, it also covers all the areas of the language. when learning the language you do everything - by this i mean you match up words, you pick the right words/phrases, you speak words and you also type after a few lessons. i personally also really like the little moscow when he pips up and says something inspiration (this function is optional on settings) and the fact you have hearts."
duolingo,5,2,"stories changes everything! i never actively seek an pp on the play store and write a review but i had to after trying the new story feature. the questions were relevant, the stories were comedy and the voice acting is superb, i really felt it when maria put salt instead of sugar in her coffee. excellent work!"
duolingo,5,1,takes a little getting used to. quite a complicated interface but it makes sense once you get to grip with it. lessons are better than roseola stone: more permission so you don't have to get every capital letter or punctuation exactly right to get an answer marked as correct
duolingo,5,1,"it is absolutely amazing, i love the fact that you can challenge other people but not be able to have any contact with them, it's kind of like a game but a learning platform. it is a really good pp, the only bad thing is that you have to keep on doing the same lessons over and over again so it starts to get boring. i really think you should download it. seriously this is free it is high quality stuff. i'm giving this 5 stars."
duolingo,5,4,"as only appear at end of each session,are very short. i am so surprised at how fast, easily i am learning languages. it's free! i do need lots of repetition to learn but i am sick and tired of learning german ""trot, passed"" with the only fun twist being ""trot und passed."" also wish that for the languages that use accents,to always show the correct written sentence; example, when it's a recording you need to write what you hear or when you need to translate,it only corrects my accents sometimes!"
duolingo,5,0,"the pp is very useful, and i enjoy using it. i'm learning german, and thanks to domingo, i'm learning much faster than i do in school. i wish that the hearts filled faster, but that's literally my only critique. so, yeah, domingo is great, it keeps you on track with your lessons by sending modifications to your phone, and it's self paced, overall, a great pp. 10/10 💯"
duolingo,5,0,"i can get by in french and am using domingo to get up to date. the voice recording are wonderfully clear with a speed up /slow down option. i'll get myself to a higher level before paying for further option, and appreciate being given the space to make this choice further along."
duolingo,5,7,fantastic. i'm so happy to find something like domingo adding scots garlic. it's not easy to find books on it even in scotland and as a language spoken by less than 1% here it really needs something like domingo to help more people get into it. you will definitely learn a lot if you stick at it and the free experience is great compared to what you might be expecting. the lesson variation and structure will teach you to come at the language from multiple angles and pick it all up at once.
duolingo,5,1,"very well put together, makes learning accessible and intuition. format allows you to learn at your own pace, whether you want a lot of material or only have time for a little bit a day. honestly worth getting if you want to brush up on your language skill."
duolingo,5,9,"between the pp and the webster, you've got yourself a perfectly useful way to learn languages any time and just about anywhere. and free?! yes!!! no catches. domingo is awesome because it can be used in very small chinks. no long courses, or video or other long time commitment. you can bang out a few good lessons while on the toilet... or waiting for the bus... or in any short moment that you get throughout the day. the key is to stick with it and let it's game-style structure show you the way. i was impressed in how the pp manages to integrate so many methods and functions for becoming comfortable with a foreign language. you don't just read or listen or watch... you do all the forms of communication you encounter in the real world (including speaking to the pp). learning with this interactive environment beats all other methods in my opinion, and i wish that domingo would take the lessons to even more advanced levels as well. maybe in the future? thank you to the developer for a great, free tool!"
duolingo,5,0,domingo is better than expected. it goes slow and reinforced the words and keeps building your vocabulary. i like the ability to say words and it check you. i wish you could do more in the free version. it seems like you get a few wrong answers and then you have to wait.
duolingo,5,3,"quick and friendly. the pp lets you get into a new language rather random, but in a great speed. even minor progress is noted in a fun, ratified way so your daily experience is a step forward. the pp reminds you every day to continue your streak and it runs well when you use it. one extra plus is the sensible approach to audit support: when audit is not a good idea, you can practice with text only. well done! great pp in grain mode, even better when you pay :)"
duolingo,5,0,first thing i want to point out is the heart system you get 5 and lose one each mistake but you can do practice mode to earn those hearts back and learn where you made a mistake you don't need to get premium for infinite hearts you won't learn if you can make 50 mistakes with no punishment. the best part about the lessons is each category has 5 levels progressively getting hard so you can go back at daytime to refresh yourself and the leagues make you more competitive so it's learning but a game
duolingo,5,0,"in a world where everyone who's read 3 pages from any book act as an expert and trying to monetize their ""knowledge"" ...domingo offers a lot of knowledge for free. the pp is well thought. it has few inconsistencies but the value domingo provides it outweigh any other flaws."
duolingo,5,1,i really enjoy using this pp. it's easy to use and the most important part is it reaches you languages in a at-your-own-pace manner. it makes you repeat lessons if you're not getting questions right and encourages you to study in order to earn extra points. earning points makes it exciting and a fun to learn. i recommend using this pp for beginners in a new language.
duolingo,5,1,"5 star so far, the entire tap and hear of it made me feel great, the entire idea was so rewarding to me, learning a new language (and then more simultaneously) with an up based system was my dream all along. even the adds in the free version are acceptable and at a much decent rate, along with the message ""this add helps us keep learning free"" which really makes it so much more empathizable with. will be back if i find any recommendations, but so far i'm much more learning from you 🥰"
duolingo,5,0,"it is fun and easy to use. domingo allows the learner to fault and repeat as many times as the learner needs, at the learner's pace, and it's free. domingo has many more strength, but i will only highlight one, it lives up to its aim of ""making learning free and fun"""
duolingo,5,9,i've gone all the way through with german. it was helpful for a visit to austria. doubled in french. now i need to learn spanish for a job. i'm making swift progress. tiny cards are great for vocabulary building- just wish they accepted contractions. the stories are helpful for actual applications of what i've been studying. the first check point exam did take vocal introduced in the succeeding lesson - an obvious mistake. didn't hold me back.
duolingo,5,1,"amazing. i'm using the pp to learn japanese from english currently, and although it's definitely suited for teaching spanish, french, and german, it's still the best way to learn japanese that i've found that actually gives you the whole language for free as well as reaches you both how to speak the language and how to read it. most japanese learning apes i've used only do one or the other. as are non-intrusion and don't hinder the pp itself at all. i highly recommend this pp."
duolingo,5,0,"love it!! i studied a bit of german many years ago. i really enjoy the interactive way of presenting, the awards system and the comments and suggestions of users. i am a very busy special needs teacher and domingo is a great positive diversion off my daily routine. thank you"
duolingo,5,1,"jaw talk svenska no! this pp has taught me more in a few weeks than i've ever learned in school. the pp is easy to navigable and the design is good to look at. overall, i'm incredibly impressed with domingo, if you want to learn a language in a fun, interactive way then definitely download this pp!"
duolingo,5,0,"it's simple a simple enough pp. there isn't pressure for how much you do in a day, you set that and can learn at your own pace. i'm not far into the pp yet, but it seems good so far!"
duolingo,5,0,"i live in amsterdam and i quickly picked up on dutch from living there but domingo has helped me so much with the more difficult words! i'm actually pretty good at dutch now. it helps that this pp makes you speak sentences into the mid, also you have to write down translations. absolutely love it!"
duolingo,5,16,"easy going but ready to give your brain a good lookout. am using the spanish language pp. suits every level of student as needed. very useful in conjunction with other methods, such as classes, but domingo also great when used on its own. highly recommended by me and by my fellow classmates. i find the different subjects provide variety as i progress - and the stories add interest to the lessons. probably the most useful and most used pp i've ever download."
duolingo,5,166,"have been using this pp daily for almost one month now, and it's been a blast. download it to learn swedish for a trip and so far it's been so much fun, haven't used the voice input so far however. other than that, the i is simple and easy to use, learning definitely feels like learning (unlike what it feels in school)"
duolingo,5,0,"can't be used by itself for language learning, but as a supplement it is my favorite pp. extremely reliable, short infrequent as, and highly rewarding. some things can be frustration but that's more due to the lessons than the pp itself. if you enjoy domingo, this pp is for you"
duolingo,5,0,"quick easy fun lessons. lots of repetition and practice. reading, writing, listening and speaking...this pp covers all the bases. you can listen to slower speech too which is great... would recommend 👍"
duolingo,5,0,"so funny, a little game that involves a lot of words, your obviously feeling that you are doing better in your life than before in memory concepts, you can not just ignore the other recourse of your learning language/s, but definitely the right place to practice and improve your skill and abilities, dankeschön do😚😉 often start"
duolingo,5,0,makes learning actually fun. with competitive leaderboards and the mitigate style to the lessons. i never thought i would stick to a learning program as long as i have of my own free will but it's been fun. the only thing is that its results are what you put into it. it's very much about how much effort you take to learn. but if you want to learn another language i don't think there is a better pp out. as are at the end of every lesson but they aren't video so you can close them immediately.
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp, it has a wide selection of languages to learn and makes it easy and fun. it also has challenges, puzzled and rewards. overall i think domingo is the best pp for learning something new!"
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp. i am learning japanese words in less than a week. i can already recognize symbols in other places and know what they mean. this pp is so helpful and i love the cut little owl. you can learn any language you want on this thing! i highly recommend this for anyone who wants to learn another language.
duolingo,5,0,"this pp helps me so much! i've made so much progress over the last 2 years and i love everything about it! even the as aren't too bad since there aren't that many and when i do get as, they're only about 5 seas. thank so much for creating domingo!!!!"
duolingo,5,0,"this pp is very helpful i am in the process of learning two languages french and welsh but as any apes need improvement i would like to change two things 1:having more life 2: a word bank for you chosen languages for example once completing a lesson the words from there go into a ""dictionary"" which will help for memory and revision thanks for reading this and creating domingo!!"
duolingo,5,1,"this really helped me with latin. the constant repetition and audit component really helped me with verbs. however, the grammar explanations were not adequate. fortunately, domingo is not my only source for learning latin, as i am also working through the hence latin program. i find that using both methods is a great way to learn. i only wish that domingo would expand its latin program. it is quite short and never even progresses past the present tense."
duolingo,5,0,"i spend more time on this pp than any other and i think that time couldn't have been better spent! just by using the free version of this pp, i've upper 😉 my makarin significantly, on all fronts in only a few months. this pp is more than useful for those seeking to open their mind's to a new language."
duolingo,5,0,it's been an amazing experience for me. all i need to do is press on a lesson and i'm in. even though you need hearts to play and when you get something wrong you need hearts you can still just have a break and then come back. just because you can get premium you dont actually need it in my opinion.👍👍👍
duolingo,5,0,overall the pp is great for the introductory stages of language learning and comprehension. i am not a fan of the as and the promotion of the pro version but it is expected from all apes in the current marketplace. overall great service regardless of the as.
duolingo,5,8,"domingo is a very helpful tool to learn languages. there are plenty of different languages in the pp. domingo offers you a lot of levels and topics just in your mobile. it is very easy to use. and the best it is free. i think is more useful to start learning a language and for intermediate level, probably for an advanced level would be better other option."
duolingo,5,0,i love it! it's very helpful in how it explains the words and i love the tips feature! it's making spanish a breeze! though i think they need a way to delete languages courses you accidentally started. and it needs more things to spend the gems on.
duolingo,5,0,great way to learn especially for free! there are as but they are minimal and non intrusion. they remind you often to take 5 minutes to learn which is great for absent minded people like myself. it helps me connect with some of my ancestors by learning a dying language (irish).
duolingo,5,0,"great pp, could use some fingering to be more practical learning based for those who want to learn a bit of a language before venturing to a foreign land. and whilst i know this thing needs to make money, please offer either a 1 year flat option or decrease the amount of times you make us free user click through as. it's more annoying and off putting than reaching a point where i'd buy out of convenience"
duolingo,5,0,"easy and fun for all ages. my girls all have the pp and we are learning as a family. there is also a little bit of the competitiveness. nothing like trying to stay on the top of the leaderboard and learning at the same time. we are learning a new language for fun, and fun is what we are getting out of this learning pp."
duolingo,5,0,"trick yes. the progress system is really fun, and every step seems like a gigantic step in learning the language. there's a ton of option, and you can really learn with it! a friend of mine has been doing the japanese course for quite some time and he can read, talk and even write japanese!!!"
duolingo,5,0,english is my first language and i'm learning dutch. i like the pp layout and the pp reminders are good at encouraging you to continue learning. i would like more speaking segments in the practice courses and throughout the pp in general.
duolingo,5,0,it's an amazing pp. i'm learning so much. which helps me a ton because i will be using the language of what i have learned and still learning to interact with my partners family. it has a lot of useful tools. it challenges you and it gives you the opportunity to correct any mistakes. love it!
duolingo,5,0,"not bad for a beginner to learn a language, but i think you should add more relatively content to he language between people in the streets, the words that the people use in their daily life, although, it's a perfect application, keep it up ! thanks"
duolingo,5,0,free and really works! i started taking spanish in the rd grade and all through school and struggled greatly barely passing or worse and could never retain anything i learned. i dont know how this pp works but suddenly i am remembering words and am able to use them and have real conversations in spanish. it is even helping me with conjunction and grammar a huge hardly for me in learning spanish. they have also added a stories section in the pp so helpful!
duolingo,5,0,wonderful learning experience. step by step. it challenges you to achieve the next level. it's fun and the repetition is absolutely helping. i have tried a lot of apes to learn to speak spanish but it didn't work for me but this pp is amazing. very interesting and disciplined. thank you.
duolingo,5,0,i'm learning a lot from this pp. my one grip is i wish there was more verbal feedback so i can here what i'm learning. like when i translate something or pick the correct translated word. they do give tips for why you got a question wrong are too few. be careful of types!
duolingo,5,0,it's good for beginners and good practice for advanced students. even when you get the right answer it's beneficial to look at the domingo answer and the posted comments as you often find useful information and explanation.
duolingo,5,0,absolutely amazing pp for learning languages. it is very simple and easy to learn. you can learn languages anywhere daytime. it also has incentive for learning. i would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn a language.
duolingo,5,0,the best! this pp is excellent and makes it really easy and fun to learn another language. i like the way the leader boards are set up and the way it makes you want to have goals and now you could make it. i'm currently learning hebrew and i can believe how much i've learned so far!
duolingo,5,1,domingo is helpful in learning a new language. i can learn at the pace i choose and not be gathered by the speed chosen by a teacher. it is not the only tool you should use but it is a great tool. you should also use a dual language dictionary and books in your target language. another great help would be a totally immersion experience and/or a native language speaker.
duolingo,5,0,"well organized and bears no resemblance to dull repetition classroom ""learning'. allows one to move among different categories of chosen language ( basis, greetings, people etc.) right away. rewards for completing lessons and errorless performance. excellent so far!"
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp! it's a wonderful way to learn languages. it's engaging and fun. best of all, it's free! would it be possible to connect the tinycards pp with it to earn up? or could flashcards be added to domingo pp?"
duolingo,5,2,it's actually fun! i look forward to my daily lessons because it's not boring to learn. and it's effective as hell. they just have to fix the 'discussion' section for the questions and we're good to go :) (it's baggy and won't open normally.)
duolingo,5,1,"only problem in college,time frame 60's was languages. her i am 60 years later learning spanish in a systematic, logical, and comprehensive manner. for me,in addition to exercise & diet for the body, i feel the need to exercise the mind. for seniors this repetition method of teaching, strengthens learning and retention skill."
duolingo,5,0,"the pp encourages you to keep going for the next goal, and that is very important when learning a new language in adulthood. i had a basic understanding of japanese from my high school years, and this pp really helps me get familiar with the much harder anti!"
duolingo,5,0,"i love the pp. it helps me learn organ easily. i just hope there will be more uses for lights in the future because after collecting the outfits, the wager and streak freeze don't really help that much. maybe use lights to double our up gain for even just a short period would be good"
duolingo,5,0,"my domingo sounds don't work. when i tap on the sound button it doesn't work so, i cannot figure out the answer and make it hard to use the application. please tell me what to do? (actually i did reinstate the pp but doesn't work again)"
duolingo,5,0,love this pp. fun and easy to use. i really love all the different ways it helps you to learn and is broken down into categories. learning couldn't be more fun! it also give the option to get practice tests if your truly serious about learning.
duolingo,5,0,this pp is very useful. i like the application very much. but few things i want you inform the developer please don't change system language while we learn hind to english because many indian can understand hind but can't read hind . besides that you know that bengal is a widely spoken language in india just after hind. so give an option to learn english from bengal. it would make your pp more popular because bengal is also spoken in bangladesh. okay thank you - best wishes from indian
duolingo,5,0,"i've been using this for a while now and if using the right method it is 100% a great tool to learn a language. with their stories, podcast, and leaderboards they really are creating a great learning environment that is fun along the way."
duolingo,5,0,"a well designed program that foster relatively quick language assimilation through an effective balance of realize reading/writing/speaking/listening feedback, vocabulary and grammar progression, motivation, and repetition. a fun, fast, and easy way to learn a new language."
duolingo,5,2,"i haven't been through enough of the pp to judge it properly, but so far is good. i'm back after using it much longer. improvements make it easier to use and more effective. learning is happening!"
duolingo,5,0,love love love this pp!!! this pp is great at learning languages and i know cause it taught me spanish in less than two months and that's just like ten minutes a day! on here you can add friends and family on here and compete with them and others on the leaderboards and it only shows you the top fifty of that language in particular that you are learning. did i mention that this pp reaches you every language but sign language. love it give this pp a shot please its great.
duolingo,5,0,"the program is great, but the sound of pronunciation and repetition of words after the basic stage is mute and the practice of repeating the words has become difficult."
duolingo,5,0,"update: problem solved, thanks to the amazing developer! it worked well for several weeks, but today it's crashing. it constantly says i'm office but i actually have very good internet connection. please fix it, thanks!"
duolingo,5,0,"2 months @ it for norwegian. have other sources to hear it spoken. very happy i can understand more of what is said.♥️ 5 months... still enjoy, but less addicted. it's extremely helpful to do on pp vs phone. less wasted time with fat thumb mistakes. interesting new update encouraging daily practice sessions."
duolingo,5,0,such a great approach to learn a new language. it works well with repetition introducing new words and recalling old ones. it cannot be compared to learn the language in a native country but it's enough to get the initial velocity!
duolingo,5,0,"really enjoying using domingo! easy to use and i'm learning fast. i love the combination of learning to read, write and speak all in the same lessons and the option to turn off speaking or listening lessons for an hour if you are unable to do them."
duolingo,5,0,"one the best apes for language learning i have came across. currently learning spanish and maintained a 6 month streak so far. you will appreciate the efficiency, fun methods and great flexible features that it provides. makes you genuinely interested in the language you are trying to learn. very highly recommended"
duolingo,5,1,"i first discovered domingo when i developed an interest in learning french a few years ago. since then, i've found that this application is ever-improving and has become more and more helpful to expose ourselves to foreign languages. both the pronunciation and comprehension exercises are greatly appreciated!"
duolingo,5,0,"honestly amazing! this pp only take 5 minutes for each lesson, (depending on how fast you complete the lesson) its easy to use and it's for free! and that's a great price. :)"
duolingo,5,1,"brilliant and easy to use. really helps make the languages clearer and repetition enough to make it stick. i've learnt more spanish from this in a few hours, then in my whole gase spanish course. highly recommend it to anyone wanting to seriously learn a language."
duolingo,5,0,i'm using this pp to brush up on my french and so far i've really enjoyed it. domingo makes learning a new language not only fun but adjective! i only want to have basic proficient and some conversational skill so not sure how it would hold up for those who want a more vigorous class. the as are not too disruption if you're on the free version.
duolingo,5,0,"a few minor bags, (maybe 3 i've seen so far), but so far a really good pp! i started out free but decided it was well worth the money for a subscription."
duolingo,5,0,the repetition is great but the stories are even better! awesome exposure to a foreign language is available for just a few minutes a day or as long as desired any day. very flexible learning tool! highly recommend!
duolingo,5,0,we can many languages from this pp i am learning japanese language i am learning it more faster than to learn from japanese people. and i would also say that i will learn japanese faster l like this pp because we can learn japanese very well 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 this. is. very. useful. for. us. we. can. learn. many. language. form. this. pp
duolingo,5,0,"brilliant way to learn spanish. the repetition nature of the way to learn from english to spanish and vice versa is very good, with the audit in spanish to learn the correct pronunciation invaluable. it drills it into your unconscious while also explaining the grammar."
duolingo,5,0,"it's convenient and fun. really helps for people doing a language for school like how i do chinese for new. this is also really good for anyone wanting to practice a language during the holidays like i do, not too mention the pp is very simple. and i haven't even been threatened by domingo for not doing my homework (yet)."
duolingo,5,0,"domingo provides a low pressure, comfortable approach to learning a language that gets you hooked on practicing and keeps you coming back to learn more. i plan on using it to learn multiple languages. buds to the developer!"
duolingo,5,0,absolutely amazing for a free pp. download it to learn my dutch. didn't even have to start from scratch because i was able to take a quit that placed me at higher levels straight away!
duolingo,5,1,"i am using the pp to learn japanese. i upgrade to the paid version and the explanations for each lesion disappeared completely. edit: several hours later, they are back. not sure what happened but very happy to see it fixed."
duolingo,5,0,"this pp is amazing! the way it reaches the languages is simple, easy, and fun. i'm learning more with domingo than any other form of language class that i have done in the past. and the color scheme and sounds are a fun touch."
duolingo,5,0,"really engaging. i find this pp really helps to develop my language skill. it seems to focus heavily on the reading and writing aspects more than the spoken word. however, if you have the drive to take what you're learning and apply it in practice it really works. it's a top tier language pp."
duolingo,5,1,this pp is great. i have spent only 5 days on it and have all ready learned over 100 words in spanish. the plus version of this pp is great and is cheap and if you don't want to spend any money then you can share it with people to get it temporarily for free. it also has barely any as and when you do get an add it is usually at the end of a lesson. over all i would highly recommend this to all people trying to learn a new language.
duolingo,5,0,"i find domingo easy and enjoyable to use. as a regular holiday visitor to spain domingo has so increased my confidence and enjoyment, even though my spanish is mainly used in the bars and restaurant! in attempting to speak the language the benefits are that the staff are so accommodation and friendly plus you are remembered when returning. i also find the daily email prompt helpful."
duolingo,5,0,"best language learning pp. combined the things you have learned as you progress through the language. but be prepared, learning a language requires a lot of practice and education."
duolingo,5,0,loved the pp so much. it tells me bed time stories like a mother. it reaches me languages like my teacher. interact with me like a friend. it's more than an pp for me. i would definitely pay for the pp and support developer.
duolingo,5,0,"i enjoy the learning process and like the little motivation cartoon character. when i feel like getting lazy and shipping the next lesson i think about my days in a row that i'll lose it motivate me work on my next lesson. it's fun and, much to my surprise i'm actually learning. i like it and i'm going to try to keep going. the way i look at it, what do i have to lose if i sit here for 10 or 15 minutes every day for the next year or more, i should learn something. that would be cool."
duolingo,5,1,i love this learning pp. but why remove the reading into on a lesson. it was a very useful supplement in helping to understand a lesson. it should be brought back. please.
duolingo,5,0,"as a person who had once known a decent amount of spanish as a child, i always regretted the fact that i had lost all but the very basis over the years. i have been very pleasantly surprised at how quickly domingo has not only been refreshing my memory after nearly 25 years of no practice, but it has already begun to teach me new words, phrases and pronunciation. this has also been key in proper sentence structure so that as i learn a word or phrase, i almost immediately know how to apply it."
duolingo,5,0,"very helpful, and they've definitely made improvements over the years. if you make a mistake in sentence structure, they show you how to correct it. i also like this new story feature. love the pp, really thankful that it's free!"
duolingo,5,0,"this is much better than all of the other free language learning apes i've seen. lessons are broken down nicely and i like how you practice listening, speaking, reading and writing the language. my 7 year old also loves this pp and is learning along with me."
duolingo,5,0,great pp! lessons move at a steady pace without being overwhelming. pus add more items in the store because i'm losing my motivation after buying everything.
duolingo,5,0,"good pp to learn languages, good if your taking mal for gase and you need extra time to study other than your already set revision. definitely recommend it, it's fun, easy to learn and it only takes a couple minutes out of your day for each lesson/course. thankyou."
duolingo,5,0,it has helped with studying so much and as a person who finds learning languages stress relieving it's super helpful. i'm also really glad to be able to pick up garlic and german again as after learning it when i was younger and stopping for a long time domingo has made it a lot simpler to ease myself into it
duolingo,5,0,"i just love this pp. it gets u addicted and the leader board gives u motivation. wish you could always make them repeat the sentences or words even after having correct answer. does not work all the time. so easy to learn. doing some spanish, portuguese and a the italian.😁"
duolingo,5,0,i've used it some years ago and wasn't convinced but some days ago i've decided to give it another chance and i'm so surprised! they made such a progress with this pp and you will do too with learning your language! so easy and playful!
duolingo,5,0,this pp is great but lately it's had a bug i guess and its voice does not work. you can't hear anything and this is such a summer because i really liked this pp. please fix it
duolingo,5,0,"i've used domingo to improve my french (along with french classes) from beginner to intermediate. it is a brilliant pp. it's fun to use, has lots of challenges and competition and covers loads of subject. the pp is intuition, with very few mistakes. highly recommended."
duolingo,5,0,it is great for some one that wants to learn the basis of a language to understand what you need to know for states. great for students that take the language as a class and want to better understand the language. it reaches many languages from german to hawaiian.
duolingo,5,0,"do reaches me spanish, little by little! a bit of italian, too, when i needed a few basis before a trip. the interface is fun and entertaining, and i have become quite addicted to my daily lessons. i have tried other language programs, and this is the only one i stuck with beyond a few sessions. highly recommended!"
duolingo,5,1,i have been using domingo to learn french for 16 months. it is a great tool to help with your studies however i would suggest you combine it with podcasts and other technique otherwise i found that listening skill suffered. the new story feature is a great addition.
duolingo,5,0,great so far! pretty intuition. i wish that it had more explanations for things and also that it had a way of looking back at a bank of all the words you've learned. i feel like this is one of the best self study apes.
duolingo,5,0,i like the way i learn phrases and useful sentences rather than lists of vocabulary. i can hear how it's pronounced and there's lots of practice rather than just testing. i'm enjoying learning and get a sense of progress.
duolingo,5,0,fantastic pp to learn english language in a interesting way. however we all can learn any language from this useful pp but since i am learning english language that' s why i told you all about it in regard of english language .however this educational pp is very important for wished who want to learn any kind of language from their mother tongue.
duolingo,5,0,"fun, easy way to learn a language. not sure how well this would work without knowing any of the language, but with a little bit of a knowledge base is very helpful. stronger in teaching listening/ comprehension than writing."
duolingo,5,0,"makes learning languages fun! it starts every language from very simple terms, like a child reading their first word books, then progresses to have you translate phrases and understand stories! plus you can compete with others for top placement in your league! fun!"
duolingo,5,0,i started learning a new language through this pp about 10 days ago. so far i love this. it is fun and keeps me motivate. my only thing is that i could not find explanation of grammar rules for that language. i have to guess it as i go through the phrases that i have to translate back and forth.

duolingo,5,0,"it's better than going to school, because one can learn at one's own pace. the pp has been improved greatly over the years. it was easier to learn when i could use my lawton with the larger screen than the minuscule screen of the cell phone. overall, it's still a great way to learn a new language."
duolingo,5,0,"extremely simple and practical. i find myself doing a little practice every day effortlessly, even with multiple languages added. very useful for maintaining and developing competence in my second languages."

duolingo,5,0,"domingo is a ""lucky"" way to learn a language: it requires you to largely work out the rules of the target language yourself, but that is exactly what babies and tollers do. domingo is not a formal systematic, highly organized language course but because it is interactive it is satisfying and fun, like doing an eternal puzzle. it is just one tool among the many which you need to use to learn a new language. it has flaws but don't treat the course seriously. serious studies are elsewhere."

duolingo,5,0,"so far, it seems to be a good learning tool. it challenges you, it allows you to guess, and it gives you hints if you need them. it doesn't necessarily make you speak the word or frames all the time, so i do this before i move on to the next lesson."

duolingo,5,0,"never realized i had the chance to learn japanese at all let alone at my own pace until domingo. i'm having a lot of fun and feel confident about my learning too. i find it pretty hard to learn a language like this that is quite different from the language i was raised in, but now i feel like it might be entirely double to really learn this new language. it's been really great! wonderful pp."

duolingo,5,0,this is an amazing webster/pp to use. i highly recommend giving this pp a try before you try any other language apes that you have to pay for. the one problem i have is that on the latin based languages there is no list of the infinite verbs and their conjunction.

duolingo,5,0,"this pp is amazing, before using it i couldn't understand spanish at all despite attending classes and thanks to the exercises with speaking i am now more confident with a new languages. but would also be fun if it would be possible to learn finnish language with this application"

duolingo,5,0,it's great...i did not know any arabic but do has day to day words that are spoken...now i have travelled to riyadh city and it's no trouble getting what people are saying in arabic at all...

duolingo,5,37,"the pp is user friendly and you really go at your own pace. you also go in your own order, which was too unstructured for me in the beginning. but i was able to structure it in a way that works for me and now i love it, and i'm learning so much! i get immersed in it because there are lessons to say what you see and hear, type what you hear, and type the english sentence from seeing it in spanish and vice versa. tip: before starting a new lesson, always click the lightbulb and read the into."
duolingo,5,0,an excellent learning tool for a language. works so well and makes learning a new language so accessible to a vast number of people.
duolingo,5,0,thanks for making this pp. super useful! i currently use domingo to improve my japanese language lesson. i can give you five thumbs up because i dont have enough fingers. j. but i can log in to my previous act just i left it a few weeks later. but still love this.👍keep toward!

duolingo,5,0,i think this pp is a fantastic way to practice whatever language you're learning on a daily basis. it helps provide good incentive to keep on top.
duolingo,5,0,great methods of teaching . steady competition along with reaching makes learning fun. the constant as for the upgrade of this pp keep begging me though.
duolingo,5,0,this pp is useful for language-learning. it would be more difficult if i did not already know some organ. i wish the sentences were spoken more slowly.
duolingo,5,5,"fairly new to this, but i'm enjoying my experience so far. if there was only one complaint, although it's not really that, it's just the word i'm using, it's that they just throw larger words and pronunciation at you without warning while you're still doing the simplest pronunciation. i'm not a quick learner, so maybe it's me and not the pp."
duolingo,5,0,a fun way to help learn any language. this pp will make learning languages fun and may cause an addition to learning. i use this pp everyday and can't put it down.
duolingo,5,0,very easy to understand. this pp is set to your pace and doesn push you. if you want to learn a new language domingo is the best way to do it and its free.
duolingo,5,4,"if you could make the streak freeze longer than a day (doesn't matter even if you charge extra lights). and provide us with something utilitarian to do with our lights. and since this pp works on a global level, it would be better if we could have a communication portal with other users to understand their language even better (i'm aware of it's sons, thus a ""block"" option would help too). all in all, i'm not here just to bladder. i've been using this pp for over 2 years now. keep it up!"
duolingo,5,0,the ratification makes the learning interesting and fun. nodules are also split up into smaller bite sized sessions so the learning can be customised according to everyone's own pace.
duolingo,5,0,i like that the pp shifts tomorrow use words or characters that you struggle with. very useful!
duolingo,5,0,best pp!!! i love that they keep looking for ways to improve! love it!!

duolingo,5,5,"in love with it! ❤️ the only missing point (in previous versions), which was user engagement, has been well handled with the help of interesting stories and tournament, making it much more fun to use the pp rather than simple lessons which become boring after some point of time. would be nice if domingo shows the correct answer rather than just saying 'you are correct!' , same as it does for a wrong answers - ''. it will help in enforcing the learning process."
duolingo,5,0,"i adore this pp! even if you don't have time, it's easy to find 5-10 minutes to practice your target language with domingo!"
duolingo,5,0,"i did not speak, read or write any french 11 days ago. today i can read parts of the french version of alice's adventures in wonderland and i can communicate verbally on a basic level with my french speaking friends on plantation network. i have a traumatic brain injury that causes learning disabilities. do is easy enough and explains everything in such simple terms that learning is easy. highly recommend"
duolingo,5,0,this is a good challenge with an acceptable learning curve. i'm enjoying it and believe it is definitely accelerating my learning.
duolingo,5,0,"amazing. i have been using this for years, and absolutely love it. it is a great platform for those who want a free pp to teach you the basis of a language. 10/10"
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is the top-of-mind and all-time favourite language learning pp! i can use basic spanish with friends, write and read spanish at the level that my latin friends say i'm good at using it. it is fun learning through the ratification. for this learning english using that version of the pp, there are still many language stitches in that version. now, the answers are strict/narrow, especially for en to th answers; some of your answers may be correct and more prevalent in real settings."
duolingo,5,0,easy to use free knowledge it has a streak system to encourage continuous use it discourages mistakes by taking 1 of your 5 hearts away. if you reach zero i think its a day you have to wait until you regain them in order to start a lesson. (it notified me when my hearts filled) helpful tips are in each lesson give not used this pp for very long. not even two weeks have i been taking french courses and i see myself using this pp to fill in unused downtime.
duolingo,5,0,an amazing way to dive into another language. both my wife and i have been using this pp for over 2 months and we love it. a very interactive a way to learn which makes it fun.
duolingo,5,0,this pp changed my life it really makes my relatives surprised because i learnt it from this. it is also acting like a video game because there is very cool power up and a live leaderboard. i am so glad i got this!
duolingo,5,0,free and thorough. what more could you want from an pp? there are plenty of other apes that overwhelm you with vocal. domingo uses a lot of repetition of basic sentences and most used verbs and vocal. the interface and added features have also greatly improved the value of this educational pp. i highly recommend it for the aspirin polyglot
duolingo,5,3,"this pp is awesome! i'm making progresses in russian, italian, and german. i anna learn serbian, but that language isn't available. 😭 pus add? :3 i think it would be better if you put information about words. for example, in russian there are 'все' and 'всё'. in order to make it easier for users, you should've added information about the difference between those two words (when to use them). i'm waiting for the improvement."
duolingo,5,5,"i have used domingo on and off for a few years now (usually starting up around the start of each year when i begin my resolutions! 😂). have just started back up again and am amazed at how much i remember. it's such an easy to understand and follow pp, and i love the little notes of encouragement that pop up along the way. highly recommended"
duolingo,5,0,great pp. so helpful and easy to practice a new language.
duolingo,5,0,"lots of valuable repetition but still a variety of ways to repeat. this makes it easier to remember the words while making it relatively fun. it is a bit frustration that you run out of lives in the middle of longer practice sessions, but i suppose that how they entice you into upbraiding and spending money."
duolingo,5,0,"i love this! makes it so easy to learn,and you can revise things over again! it's so flexible! great!!!"
duolingo,5,8,"i was dubious about domingo, as a free language pp seems too good to be true. that being said, do is everything that it bands itself as. the written learning is comprehensive. the audit is slightly robotic at times but definitely understandable. there are even phrases that it wants you to speak, allowing practice for spoken word. when trading your answers do will accept other ways to say the same thing, showing that it is an intelligent program. overall i cannot advocate for domingo more"
duolingo,5,0,"excellent pp, it has improved since it first came out a few years back; i didn't use it at that time. however, now i'm impressed with it. a much better learning environment."
duolingo,5,0,really user friendly. makes learning easy to understand. easy to get in 5 -15 minutes a day
duolingo,5,0,"amazing i ve learned so much in a couple of weeks about two languages, it is very intuition( at least for me that i m italian while learning latin languages) and i feel it like a videogame 👌"
duolingo,5,0,"i work as a maintenance man in yosemite national park, and i was able to communicate in makarin to guests. it was very little cause i just started learning but the guest were very pleased to see the effort. i can believe i am learning a new language without choosing. greatest pp ever."
duolingo,5,0,great learning experience! may you can add more option like story telling and instant word dictionary for better experience. overall loving it.
duolingo,5,0,"this is really a great opportunity to learn a new language with minimum time effort and maximum results ""on the go"". whenever i have a spare moment i can work on my skill."
duolingo,5,0,"accessible, motivation. gradually building up skill and lots of repetition to get it to stick in your memory."
duolingo,5,0,"i love its gameficiation, simplicity, and its community. i will try to learn as much languages as i like on domingo."
duolingo,5,0,"very good pp, very progressive, very pedagogical, well designed, well implements, i strongly recommend too try it"
duolingo,5,34,"i paid for rabble for a year and hardly used it. it always felt like a chose and it didn't seem worth the cost (especially since i've had to stop working because of health issues). fastforward to finding domingo: now this is an pp i can get into! the format feels like a real game and not a lesson. you earn rewards and are motivate to return to continue your daily ""streaks"". this fun atmosphere in the pp keeps me coming back. i really have a chance to improve now! thanks do! 😊"
duolingo,5,0,"nice pp, progress at your own pace. it takes a lot of repetition but that is the best way to remember new words."
duolingo,5,0,"easy pace. can increase pace if wanted. i like the different sections i.e. travel, food, etc"
duolingo,5,0,"love it! considering upbraiding to pro even, but for now the free content is enough and the adds are not annoying or intrusion."
duolingo,5,0,"totally fun! my daughter and i compete against each other every day and are using what we learn when we talk to each other. we're having fun and learning, thanks to this pp!! thank you, very much!"
duolingo,5,1,"amazing pp, i've been learning danish and i've picked up so much more than i thought i ever could and i haven't even been doing it for a month yet. i never thought i was very good at languages but this has boasted my confidence and i will start to learn a second once i get more client in my first choice. my partner is learning indonesian and my son makarin! have recommended to my family and friends, it's brilliant!"
duolingo,5,0,"i like this pp, it helps me to know better than playing other games it's so good even when i have mistakes domingo makes me stronger"
duolingo,5,0,i'm glad i stumbled upon that domingo fan-song on couture because it's the reason i download (and actively use) this pp. 1/18/2020: still using this pp. still 5 stars.
duolingo,5,0,such a great tool to familiarity yourself with a new language. very interactive and user friendly. i would like to see an option where you could tag certain items that were found to be difficult and required more attention so you could re visit them more readily and easily but the practice sessions suffice somewhat.
duolingo,5,0,"just love it !!! this pp is perfect for someone who wants to learn at their pace and time.... the leaderboards and streaks are pushing people to complete exercises everyday, huge helping us to not miss a day of learning. i just love this!!! thankyou... though you could include chatting service with friends :)"
duolingo,5,51,"i've been using this for a while now, trying to learn spanish. it's pretty convenient to learn the way it's designed. doesn't take much of your time but makes sure you visit the basis. there are no intrusion as, and no harrasment on pushing you to pay. it steadily increases your vocal, to make it competitive it puts you in various designation... gives you medals etc. it tests your pronunciation as well. pretty neat if you want to make an effort to learn."
duolingo,5,0,really easy to use and it feels more like a game rather than lessons. i'm definitely befitting and learning spanish quickly.
duolingo,5,0,"simply excellent and free , a few adds but hey ho that's how they get paid and we get it free."
duolingo,5,0,helpful to support learning a language. for a free pp the as aren't too intrusion. great work!
duolingo,5,0,"really good! reinforced what you just learnt, jumps back and forth between hearing and reading and makes you translate both ways."
duolingo,5,0,"hi! i like your pp, but i have a suggestion. can you please add two separate courses for spanish: one for latin (mexico) spanish and one for castillian (spain) spanish? some people might want to learn a different type of spanish than the one you offer. if you could do this, that would be great! 🌈"
duolingo,5,0,fun way to learn a new language. lots of repetition really helps solidity the learning of words.
duolingo,5,0,"i have been using domingo for many years now and it really interesting and helpful and i appreciate all the effort for making the pp more effective and attractive, so thank you so much for the greatest pp. one thing i was hoping that there would be an option to pronounce the sentences in the two languages because not always i am native speakers for the language i choose an try to improve it while i am learning other language"
duolingo,5,0,"this pp has all the aspects needed to really retain languages; reading, writing, and speaking. also it is fun to use."
duolingo,5,0,"it's been an enjoyable experience so far learning spanish! the free version has everything i need, and i'm learning faster than i ever thought i would! the only thing i wish it offered was better tendency for spelling errors."
duolingo,5,0,"the beautiful thing about the pp is that no matter what, if you use it, it reaches you. oftentimes there's the opportunity to let domingo show you the meanings of the words while you're answering, at first i thought this was a bit cheap; but actually, you're there to learn and if you need a reminder or not, if you put in the time you are learning."
duolingo,5,0,"great way to begin learning a language. the use of avert is responsible, so they don't feel intrusion"
duolingo,5,0,"super easy to use, with plenty of incentive to keep me motivate. lots of different languages to choose from. really cool pp."
duolingo,5,0,"i find this pp really good for my children, it helps them step by step and works really well. i would recommend. if possible, though, could you add lithuania to learn? i understand if you can; it is very specific. i love the variation and the different option! thanks so much!"
duolingo,5,0,"in learning french to better communicate with my wonderful love and so far this pp has been helping me better than any class i've ever been in. they make it fun and game like so for me it's an excellent learning tool. i highly recommend this for anyone wanting to learn additional languages. i mean come on, they even have clinton!"
duolingo,5,0,it's a great pp and i appreciate what domingo can do. if you seriously practice you can and will learn to speak another language with domingo! i'm hooked!
duolingo,5,0,user friendly and well designed to bring the new language student along into progressively better skill. fun to do.
duolingo,5,0,"really well designed and effective. it does take effort to motivate yourself to use it, but it does get you there."
duolingo,5,1,does what it says on the box. just follow the instructions and remember that it is based on american english which is less than perfect by some distance.
duolingo,5,10,amazing language learning pp. it is the best one i have found and i love the way the league makes you want to learn more to get up. i love the pp style and hope they keep it like that. it would be nice though if you could delete courses on your phone too instead of only on a computer. again a brilliant pp and the teaching system is great.
duolingo,5,0,"have used do to refresh my italian, spanish and french. fun, easy, helpful. like a game but i'm learning and practicing languages!"
duolingo,5,0,good pp for learning english. i've been working with this application more than 2 years and i'm very satisfied.
duolingo,5,0,"absolutely amazing pp. well designed, fun way to learn language."
duolingo,5,15,"the pp has really helped me with learning new languages. the lessons are quite fun, and don't feel like just a big chose. the league system also helps, as it encourages you to do more lessons. the only complaint i have is that the lights feel a little useless. you can get a new skin for do with them, and occasionally you can buy extra lessons with them, but other than that, they don't feel very important or useful. i feel like i should spend them, but there's nothing to spend them on."
duolingo,5,0,best intellectual pp ever. i surely recommend for anybody that wants to learn more... :) eventhough the hearts thing is annoying but it's okay as long as we may practice to get some hearts or even continue our lesson on the web version...
duolingo,5,0,"if you're looking for a language tutor without having to meet face to face, this pp is the best recommendation for you. it is super intuition and fun. i found it very effective."
duolingo,5,0,"brilliant and fun way to start learning a language, the welsh course seems extremely well thought out and reinforced learning throughout."
duolingo,5,0,"love it, very useful and intuition and is currently helping me learn a new language in a fun and engaging way!"
duolingo,5,0,so far this pp is the best resource i have had for learning languages. the podcast is great as well
duolingo,5,181,"this is a great pp for learning languages! it's very helpful to beginners like myself. i am learning swedish currently. i have never had any swedish learning before whatsoever, but now i am...well, not client, but getting there. the thing i don't like is the fact that there are a lot of things you cannot do without premium. but still, even without premium it's a great pp! tack sa market, developer!!!"
duolingo,5,1,the application is great. it is good to know that i may get strong a level for free. there are few things that bother me though: 1) is there a way to add words and dictionary sections + the part with learning material for each block from your webster to the pp? it others a lot to keep using brother for checking how many words i know or checking the rules 2) i am getting way too many lights if use pp every day. nowhere to spend them anymore. can you add maybe extra texts or things in shop?
duolingo,5,0,"best money spent on an pp! right up there with quiet. so easy.fun. i love that they've added new content and modes of learning, such as stories, as well as quires to level up faster. it's captive and encourage s healthy competition among users for an extra boost of motivation. it works for me."
duolingo,5,0,"a lot of language option, very good base point for kicking off your language learning / learning basic vocabulary and phrases."
duolingo,5,0,"this is very useful pp, the idea of pp creation is very good. but i am facing a trouble during some lesson, i am using it for learning hind to english. i face problem in match words question like in hind billion and in english cats, if you match this word you get a message your match is wrong. it is also wrong with words like here, hats, girls. otherwise its a very good learning language pp."
duolingo,5,0,easy and convenient to use. encouragement too and good use of printed and spoken word.
duolingo,5,0,"i'm 5 days into this pp, i love how it reminds me every day with motivation & encouragement. as someone who has used babel before, this is hands down the best & it's got a free version! do yourself a favor & download it!"
duolingo,5,0,overall - very good. learning spanish as my th. the only suggestion i would give to developer this far - please add chapters on grammar. they only appear when i make a mistake.
duolingo,5,0,fun and easy! love this pp. i feel more respected when i tell people i know multiple languages. ありがとうございました!!
duolingo,5,13,i love this pp. starting from the very basis it is easy to pick up and very adjective! i find it very helpful to red the lessons to achieve 5 crowns with increasing difficulty to help solidity what i have learned. i would however like to do just a little bit more english to french written translation. but definitely a brilliant pp that will hopefully have me speaking and understanding french in no time!
duolingo,5,5,"it's a great pp! i've been wanting to learn german for last 6 years, but was never able to get over the 300-500 dollar price tag of roseola stone, i found this thanks to the internet and i have now been learning german for past 6 months, great pp, it explains everything to you in detail so there is no confusion at all! the as are definitely not a problem, one appears every couple lessons or so which is great. overall great pp, love it! 5 stars!"
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp. i am a teacher so i understand what it takes to learn a new language. this pp is very well designed. the increase in learning material is gradual and there is a lot of repetition. it covers reading, writing, speaking and listening. i love that it sends daily reminders for practice time. my students love it too."
duolingo,5,0,i generally use it on my commune. quick and efficient way to learn. loving it!
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp - it really does make learning fun and easy! i used rabble for a while and found that i learn more/stay more interested with do. and i like that do is much more unfordable and i dont lose my progress if i subscribe from the paid pp (unlike rabble which forces you to subscribe to have any access at all).
duolingo,5,6,"i love this pp. i'm currently studying japanese. my biggest complaint for japanese specifically is that there are lessons for hiragana, but we're kind just thrown straight into katakana and anti. i used separate apes to learn katakana on my own, but it'd be nice if i didn't have to use multiple apes. i should also mention that some of the phrases that we learn in japanese are extremely rarely used by native speakers (according to hellotalk friends). anyhow, this pp is great. thanks domingo!"
duolingo,5,7,"i personally started to use do lingo in order to learn japanese, after it was recommended to me recently. thus far it has delivered, and has been enjoyable and fun to use. from its small semi-competitive leaderboards which inspire one to strive to be better in order to be the best of your division, to its simple easy to use i. if you are to learn a language i would recommend using do lingo for the reasons listed previously. (also good luck on whichever language you are attempting to learn.)"
duolingo,5,0,"very simple and easy to use, very motivation too, and interface is very nice."
duolingo,5,0,"in my opinion this is the best pp to learn a new language, it makes the whole process much more easier and you have fun at the same time. for sure the best investment of time"
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is the best pp ever. i like it over all the other things. it helps me a lot a lot with self study for my german. lessons are repeated to enforced the vocabulary, with pronunciation so my ears get used to the words both verbally and morally. now stories are unlocked in mobile version which is awesome. thank you very much! dance schon!"
duolingo,5,0,"it is, so far, truly free. it has some as, but they're non-intrusion and you can choose to watch or not."
duolingo,5,0,definitely a great and handy pp. i found this when i was looking to connect my roseola stone course to my phone for on the go learning and found that they wanted more money after already paying $100's for the course. so far i have only been using the free version of domingo and it is easily as good as roseola stone.
duolingo,5,0,great way to learn or improve your language skill...for free! (and the as are actually interesting)
duolingo,5,0,repetition est mater studious. repeating words from different angles and different structures really makes you learn with no trouble. great system.
duolingo,5,0,"have found it extremely clear and effective with multiple languages. have tried many platforms in the past, but none have been as easy to use."
duolingo,5,0,this is one of my favourite game apes. i originally found it for use in french immersion primary-grade afterschool supplement homework for my child. we enjoy it clot.
duolingo,5,0,so far it's been great learning. it uses various methods which is helpful for those who learn through certain methods rather than others
duolingo,5,0,makes it super simple and easy to learn a new language. all it takes from you is effort and consistency.
duolingo,5,0,works well as a practice tool. the interface is great. obviously a lot of thought and research put into it.
duolingo,5,0,"great pp keeps me engaged with the content, fun, and very information."
duolingo,5,0,"i love practicing ,its easy and not confusing except for organ . i got confused with some of the bowels. and very beginning sounds."
duolingo,5,0,this pp makes learning a new language easy. it constantly adds new lessons and different ways of learning.
duolingo,5,0,it's a very good pp to learn other (s) language (s) or to practice one you already know.
duolingo,5,0,great vocabulary bolster. you have to infer grammatical rules from exposure which can work well but it would be nice to have explanations as well
duolingo,5,0,"absolutely love this pp! i have learned so much. the free version of this pp has relatively unobtrusive as compared to most: no noisy video as, just images to dismiss. they offer so many languages, and their teaching tools are quite effective. i've been at this for nearly a year, and i'm completely addicted. thank you for this wonderful educational tool!"
duolingo,5,0,it's a close friend of mine for about five years now. but recently i have a unbelievable problem with it. the sound of course don't work properly. all of them get mute during the tests! i am trying to fix this problem because it's not so easy to forget this friend so soon. i hope it will be fixed in the next update. (please!)
duolingo,5,94,"this pp is awesome. i have never learnt a language besides english and my mother young german. right now i am learning portuguese and it's working like a charm. the interface is simple and inviting. just one minor thing i have to complain is the use of lives, but because the pp makes it so easy to learn a language, mistakes will be rare, and hearts are also easy to regain. the most awesome thing is that it is completely free to use, while still providing tons of teaching. i love it 👌💯"
duolingo,5,3,i really like this pp i have learned a lot. regarding the new update - i think this is the first time in history where an update improved the pp. the new stories are great. developer- one way you could improve this pp is to create a setting so it would only focus on understand and speaking. i have a young child i would like to use the pp but she doesn't read and write well enough yet. office use would be great. thanks for a great pp we travel all over and we tell everyone about it.
duolingo,5,0,great for learning languages. it's so easy to use and very well designed. also almost no adds.
duolingo,5,0,"i loved it, it help me learn russian a lot, i would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs help learning a language!"
duolingo,5,0,"it's really helpful and easy to use, my english improved a lot after that i started using this pp, i really recommend"
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp! it is easy and fun to use. i recommend this pp to people who are new to the language that they want to learn.
duolingo,5,0,"simple.been using for 2 weeks and have made some improvements. still need time to tell, but its intuition and easy."
duolingo,5,0,i have never had a language pp work as good as this one the other language apes did not work for me but the words in domingo stay in my brain.
duolingo,5,0,this pp makes learning like a game. i'm doing this for work to help communicate with my workers but it feels more like a game than studying. i've already recommended it to my stepdaughter who is studying spanish for school.
duolingo,5,0,i just started and now! this pp taught me more about a language than i could now from and lessons!!!! good job on such an amazing pp.
duolingo,5,0,good pp for learning. but you can add a chat option with other people so we can learn there tone of voice and cultural.
duolingo,5,0,seriously such a great pp. it's not without its occasional kinds but it really is incredible. it's a must have for learning a language along side of other things like immersing oneself in the language by maybe watching to shows or listening to podcasts that speak the language you're trying to learn.
duolingo,5,0,pretty good so far! do a few exercises during my breaks at work and a couple at home. it uses advertising for the free version but they dont overwhelm you with them or force you to sit long periods to watch them. and their is plenty to learn
duolingo,5,0,"this is one of the best language apes i've tried - i can't believe it's free! for latin languages, i can say that the domingo approach to learning works for me - those languages also include tips for each lesson that explain the grammar involved in the lesson in simple terms with useful examples. for languages such as polish and russian, i think some more work would need to be added before domingo could be considered a go-to approach for these languages - there are no tips for each lesson."
duolingo,5,0,"great, precise, effective, is just very easy to learn a new language with the pp."
duolingo,5,0,great pp. really easy too navigable and use. it would be cool if it had a dark theme though.
duolingo,5,0,"excellent way to learn a foundation for a language, but it has to be accompanied by immersion."
duolingo,5,0,having a great time with this pp. more features online but this keeps me learning when i'm not at my computer.
duolingo,5,0,"great pp, its teaching methods are very effective and for the pp being free it would be silly not to pick up a language or two"
duolingo,5,0,"it's been a wonderful experience. domingo is the best way one can get to learn a new language. currently, i am learning german. as soon as i get with this i'll start learning another language. the way they have set the criterion and practice exercises. you stay interested. they have managed everything in such a way that you don't forget what you have read previously. thanks domingo!"
duolingo,5,1,"in going to be honest right now this game is boring,i never really enjoyed it and couldn really use it for long until i got bored but with the new update i love it!the update has new stories and they are always fun and entertaining and come with twists!now i love using this pp and have no problem get a few stories every day!this makes me happy because i can have fun and learn a new language at the same time!5 stars love it!"
duolingo,5,0,"awesome, just what i was thinking of. i can get to high levels shooting bubbles or breaking bricks, i wished there was an pp that i could learn another language. my daughter said that the grandkids were using domingo, so i download it and within a couple days knew it would be worth it to pay for the upgrade. i spent a solid year learning morse code with apes, so i know i can do this. the reparative slow steps levels are just right."
duolingo,5,0,i really like this pp because it's free and it allows you to learn a new language. it is encouraging and it is fun to use. this pp is pretty great and you can easily learn a new language!
duolingo,5,2,the different forms of repetition are very helpful. and it's all free so it's hard to complain. the only thing i find extra challenging is pronunciation in certain languages like garlic and iceland. the sounds aren't explained very much and even in supplementary online searches it's difficult to compensate for this. but if you already know some fundamentals or are starting an easier language than you're good to go.
duolingo,5,0,"it's a fairly fun way to learn a language, if you truly want to learn or get a better understanding, starting with this wouldn't be a bad idea"
duolingo,5,0,this pp is ideal to learn a new language. even if you are not a native speaker you can easily speak that language bluntly within a span of a few months.
duolingo,5,0,"recently improved, addressing many issues i had previously, my only real criticism is the frequent as."
duolingo,5,0,love it! it really does work! i've been using this pp for 10 days and i can already read sentences!!!
duolingo,5,0,"great pp. as are never fun, but they've got to make money somehow from us freeholders."
duolingo,5,0,i simply love it. it is free of cost and it allows you to learn a language in a fun way.
duolingo,5,0,"it is great. the way you teach is a pleasure to me. my association with this pp has rejuvenated me , guiding me in the right way. now i never skin a day's lesson or rather i like not to skin it. it is really some,so inspiring. whenever i mistake repeatedly, do simple echo plate. do now allows me to access stories, podocast etc. thanks."
duolingo,5,0,wonderfully free pp that has dozens of languages to choose from. it's almost better than a class room.
duolingo,5,6,"this pp is, in my opinion, the best free language learning pp out there! not only can you learn whatever language in english, you can also choose which language you want to learn in. there are great lessons, podcasts, short stories in all languages to learn. you can also be competitive with other users. the only thing this pp doesn't have is the option to set chats with other users. i feel like that will complete this pp definitely."
duolingo,5,0,best free pp for languages. sure there may be restore payment option but you can easily learn the language of your choice for free and its so easy and fun! who!
duolingo,5,0,"i love domingo, but i can't hear anything on listening practice recently. please fix this technical problem. thanks"
duolingo,5,0,"i have been using this for a couple hours now to learn dutch, so far it has been pretty good and really help you learn at a steady pace."
duolingo,5,0,very adjective and i am even okay with the adds. good variety of exercises.
duolingo,5,0,"easy , uncomplicated sentences. gets you familiar with words used often."
duolingo,5,0,this is a really user friendly pp. the constant boots and reminders are so encouraging.
duolingo,5,0,love this pp. it uses space repetition which helps you retain the vocal for so much longer! the new grammar tips are good too! would still recommend a bit of extra time spent on looking at grammar or with domingo but would highly recommend! loads of language available too. option to link with friends to keep the motivation going!
duolingo,5,0,the best language learning pp. the updated keep it interesting. i love the stories to read and learn.
duolingo,5,0,easy learning. it's a fun pp and keeps you motivate. probably the easiest pp to use i've come across and delivers what it promises.
duolingo,5,0,one of the best apes! it would be cool if it had the option to add unknown words to personal word file in the pp

duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp and i'm so happy it's free. but there are some major issues with quality/correctness of the material, especially incorrect audit (chinese, organ). please review the material thoroughly. but for a free pp, it's super great, so i still round up to 5 stars."
duolingo,5,0,"best online or digital language program i have experienced. i've learned more about hungarian grammar and structure in the two weeks i've been using domingo than in the last 10 years of occasional study. mostly, i think because it is fun, easy and efficient with domingo!"
duolingo,5,0,easy to use ! learning and retaining a lot. love the interface.
duolingo,5,0,"good it reminds you to practice frequently. it is designed to encourage you to practice your listening, reading, speaking, and writing skill. intelligent mistakes recognition tool, helps clot to improve weaknesses in any of the above mentioned skill in learning a foreign language."

duolingo,5,0,i love this pp very much.it has so many levels. it will help you to learn any language in one month.
duolingo,5,0,very good pp for learning new languages. just pay attention!
duolingo,5,1,"when you are able to disabled the word bank, this pp is 5/5. you learn so fast. without the word bank you dont learn nearly as fast. frustrated not to have this ability. 5/5 if you can disabled the word bank 1/5 if you cannot edit: they brought back the ability to type every answer! my learning is going to sky rocket now! thank you! 5/5"
duolingo,5,0,😘wonderful!! learning to speak different languages made fun & easy! i definitely recommend this pp to anyone who wants to learn a new language.
duolingo,5,0,"loving this pp. i'm enjoying doing it every day, but the modifications and email are too much!"
duolingo,5,0,"really great pp, i have learned so much already. it's fun and simple to use and best of all free!"
duolingo,5,8,"brilliant pp for learning languages, i've learnt a good lot of swedish and while there are faults here and there, these are quickly fixed by the de team. the only major problem is that some of the less common languages don't have reverse courses, e.g there is swedish from english, but not english from swedish. however, this is does not affect one's learning significantly and i'm sure the des already have their work cut out for them with all the other languages. definitely would recommend."
duolingo,5,0,"pp is great, i love it. i know i need to be doing more to learn, but this is very practical for a busy lifestyle and a good start for beginners."
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp so far! i'm trying to learn japanese and for the basis it's really making it easy to study. i especially love the tips. only things i'd want would be a cool to section where you can like read through a bunch of different tips for each section instead of just one but overall i love it
duolingo,5,4,"i've been using domingo on and off for years - i have difficulty sticking to habits, but i keep coming back to domingo because of its easy interface and intuition language building exercises. it's been interesting watching the pp develop, improve, and expand over time, and i was especially excited when they added japanese, a language i knew but am now rusty on. thanks to domingo, i'm improving my conversational skill again."
duolingo,5,3,"it's a really good pp! it has a large variety of languages to learn from and it is (from my experience) the easiest and less costly way to learn! they take the learning process step-by-step and even adapt to the user's needs by having them select their preferred learning methods for specific needs( travel, school, etc.)"
duolingo,5,0,"i find this pp very encouraging, and keeps me on track, however i would dearly love to learn makarin simple language as i have more contact with chinese communities, this would help me enormously, but i'm enjoying learning italian too, thank you very very much,"
duolingo,5,0,learning a languages has never been that much fun.. learning through answering questions like a game is really an effective methodology..
duolingo,5,7,it's easy to use and intuition. i like the fact that you can repeat the exercises until you pass the test at the end of each section. the audit is mixed between male and female voices and allows to to repeat it until you get it right. points system is rather complicated and when you run out of points it seems to restrict what you can do. for example the tests can only be completed if you have enough points. in the end i have subscribed for the plus version to remove these limitations and the as.
duolingo,5,0,"i thoroughly enjoy this game! i have learned a ton since using it. the tips, the lessons, the stories... with real versions of people saying the phrases and words in native speaking. i started with the free version and have now had pro for just over a year. love it!"
duolingo,5,0,"fantastic language learning platform. i am studying french and it is accessible and easy to learn! my one complaint is that the free version of domingo gives you a limited amount of mistakes before you are locked out for a time. with premium, you get as many tries as you like! enjoy!"
duolingo,5,1,"this pp makes learning languages easy and fun.it is also easy and convenient to pick up and use, doesn't take up much space on your device and encourages you to use it every day. however, there is one small bug-the voice recognition questions are lenient to the point where while learning french someone said something in hind in the background and it said that it was correct."
duolingo,5,0,"amazing resource that manages to stay free without constant annoying plays to get you to spend as much money as possible. it does truly feel like the mission statement was to educate the world first, then figure out how to fund it. can't think of a better system for mobile language learning"
duolingo,5,0,"i took german way back in 96-98, so i decided to download a few german apes to start back up. domingo is easily one of the best apes there is! i feel like i'm learning way faster than i did in high school - i recommend it to everyone"
duolingo,5,0,"excellent, free language learning pp. it's truly shocking that this level of effective education is available for free. i've used the norwegian and spanish courses and i'm so grateful to domingo."
duolingo,5,0,"loving this learning process so far. fun, accessible, and motivation to stick with it."
duolingo,5,0,"i like it very much. it,'s free and better then what i expected. 5 stars is not enough."
duolingo,5,0,"very much like the gameified aspect of the teaching, gives you a goal and constant incentive to keep studying!"
duolingo,5,1,"holy money!! i remember using this pp way back when and i redownloaded it. they improved so much on a great concept. i love how it challenges you to red lessons so your exposed to familiar material. i love how each lesson comes with an optional introduction that gives a crash course in what your learning. in every way this is the future of education and i accept do as my new overland. edit: i also wanted to add that the do stories are amazing, and i'd love to see some in japanese!"
duolingo,5,0,it's very nice and help to increase the knowledge every day. so i recommend this tool for everybody that wants to learn other language.
duolingo,5,0,"i love the repetition lessons. i'm a very high sanctioning dyslexic and the repetition block lessons are exactly what i need. i'll no doubt take longer to learn spanish because of the dyslexia, but this program encourage me to keep going in a way that i need. i considered a personal tutor but knew it would have to be someone with quite a bit of patience. this program allows be to feel more confident during lessons and not worry about getting some answers wrong. you move on and come back to it."
duolingo,5,0,a great way to learn a language. it is simplifies and easy to follow with lots of repetition.
duolingo,5,2,"this pp is simply amazing! i have learned so much in the last 2 months of using this pp, and now i am able to have conversations in danish with the dates (and even they are impressed with how much i have learned)! 10/10 recommend one thing though: i'm a little disappointed that you don't have finnish on here, since that would be my next language to learn 😕"
duolingo,5,0,great pp! i am enjoying using it very much! very clear to understand
duolingo,5,5,such a fun & very effective way to learn a new language. i'm hooked & have learned a ton already. the format is especially helpful because you get to hear the pronunciation if words as you go. it's almost like having a conversation while you learn. and i love the little cut owl that gives me positive encouragement along the way. bravo!
duolingo,5,5,"an amazing pp. it's quite adjective. the fact that learning is made into a game(kind of) is the best thing about it. i feel i already learned so much which seemed easy and arabic is not an easy language to master. thank you. i love this pp. update! i have used this pp for some time now and i still like it. i would really like there to be a part with all the words you learn, like a vocabulary or dictionary for that level. please make it.please x"
duolingo,5,7,"quite honestly i wasn't sure how i was going to feel about the pp. the font agitated me in the beginning, but not enough to dock a star. you have to be very careful when looking at certain kann ("" i"" and ""sa"") as at first glance it may seem to be the same character so take your time. other than that the lessons are fun, the heart system adds little risk to the reward, and my personal favorite piece for competitive learner's like myself, the banking system is perfect. i love this pp!!!"
duolingo,5,0,"i don't think that is possible to get fleecy whit this system, but definitely helps a lot to fix grammar... it only depends on how you use it."
duolingo,5,32,"this is the most amazing pp. normally as of apes runs you crazy. but i am even happy to click and read the as that this pp shows at the end of each lesson to support them somehow. furthermore, it is the greatest pp ever. my goal was to learn another 1 language. now it has become another 3 languages for the next 4 years of my life. thank you guns. the parma of what have you done here will keep paying back to you. many thanks"
duolingo,5,6,this is a great pp and very good quality especially considering it's free! i had previously used roseola stone on pp and find the experience of this pp very good in comparison. handy to have on your phone too! there are loads of languages to choose from and the teaching is intuition and fun. so far it's easy to continue without needing to pay money. pp runs very smoothly. definitely recommend.
duolingo,5,5,a great pp for learning languages. it is fun and has perfect progression through the levels to consolidate and ebbed your learning from vocabulary building up to phrases selecting the correct words in the new language and then writing phrases from memory. i love this pp and am currently on a 52 day streak! i highly recommend it to anybody wishing to learn a new language.
duolingo,5,235,"i thought this was extremely helpful and really fun. i'm a competitive person so the leaderboards and achievements help me to stay engaged which is super helpful. when it comes to the content itself, i thought it was very effective. they repeat the same questions in different ways to be very thorough and make sure you understand. it definitely helps when memorizing. just one tip, if you have big fingers like me, and make a lot of types, make sure to re-read your answer before pressing ""check""."
duolingo,5,17,"since using domingo, my vocabulary has increased giving me the confidence to speak in public. at first, i was skeptically on how domingo could help me read, write, and speak in a different language. today, i happily recommend domingo as a way to obtain a new language! i would also recommend the practices that accompany each lesson and the interactive stories!"
duolingo,5,6,"very easy to use, i love the stories you can read in another language! the pp doesn't use much data when playing without wife and the variety of question types helps you to learn all aspects of the language. i love domingo but i struggled setting it up a bit as it kept not accepting my password and not telling me why but i worked it out in the end."
duolingo,5,2,"it's a great pp and i have learnt a lot of french from this pp. i recommend this pp to everyone, and even young children can use this. using this pp is very easy and the exercises are great to improve language skill. however, i wish they had a few more languages and sometimes the audit doesn't work on some devices, despite turning it on. overall, this is a wonderful pp and i have been using it for a long time."
duolingo,5,0,"very nice language learning pp that uses your reading, listening and speaking abilities to teach, wholeheartedly recommend"
duolingo,5,0,this is an excellent way to casually learn a new language. it is fun and easy to use. i would highly recommend this pp to anyone who is looking to learn a new language.
duolingo,5,0,"best way to learn foreign languages for free. all well planned courses, most of the languages are covered. best part is they are teaching the full coarse freely unlike other apes"
duolingo,5,0,"this is the best language teaching pp. before this pp i was just lost. it is also free, and the as are not invasion. i highly recommend this pp."
duolingo,5,0,so easy and fun. it gives enfants on repeating what we are learning and that is very good to fix it in memory.
duolingo,5,0,nice way to teach a new language very easy and revision is quite strong.
duolingo,5,0,"this is a very thorough and diverse pp! there are many languages to learn, and with a very practical method. the lessons are deep, repetition and engaging. there are experience points that helps you feel your achievements and to be a part of a big community."
duolingo,5,0,this is the best pp! i'm learning spanish fast and from the being or you can start at any level your are. this pp is well working and the greatest
duolingo,5,0,"it is a helpful pp. a cut style, quality gameplay. there are many languages."
duolingo,5,6,"thoroughly enjoyable. the integrated learning approach is new to me and i find it works better than the traditional system of learning verb declensions and lists of vocabulary. i adore the little owl with his or her positive reinforcement. by practicing little and often, i now find myself on day 307. it has just whizzed by. i almost enjoy making mistakes because the method of the same phrase appearing repeatedly until you get it right means you are forced to understand how it works."
duolingo,5,0,"only a few days in. great motivation for small lessons, really turns it into a game you feel you're winning, and you don't want to lose your 'streak'. minimal invasion reminders, usually once a day with a second reminder in the evening if you didn't complete the lesson. as agent bad at all. this is how free apes should work."
duolingo,5,268,"i love it!!! hoping that every upgrade stay helpful and engaging while keeping the pp free. i love domingo so much that i'm rating an pp for the first time. anyway, it's really helpful, the visual are all cut, and everything just seems to good to be true. so i'm really hoping they keep this pp great at the same time free. thanks to the people behind it! 🥂"
duolingo,5,10,"great pp to learn a language. there is a premium subscription, but i never really felt like i *had* to get it. there are advertisements, but they aren't intrusion at all and the pp doesn't bombard you with them. i also like the streak system, every day you complete a lesson, your streak increases, so you have an incentive to learn every day (if such a thing works on you)."
duolingo,5,11,very good pp. this pp allows for a lot of practice of the language which has helped me to better understand the principles and to work towards mastery of a foreign language (french in my case). there is however room for improvement in my opinion. the addition of oral exercises which would allow the learner to practise speaking as well as the inclusion of comprehension passages would be useful.
duolingo,5,0,"superb pp, great fun to use and i really feel like i'm achieving something. it's a wee bit adjective."
duolingo,5,1,its great. fantastic there is no flaw or at least none that i have found yet i love it. although just one tiny thing maybe if the pictures were removed then it might be harder to figure out what what because whenever its a find out what this word is question it always shows photo to make it obvious but other then that its great
duolingo,5,0,very good pp. makes learning into a game and less of a chose.
duolingo,5,123,"this is absolutely amazing. i wanted to learn japanese, just to add some fun into my life, and it's working perfectly! domingo is super admitting, and fun to use. thank you for it being free! one thing others me, however... the as. this is probably a common complaint, but i usually hit the stop as with super do on accident. make it easier to close as please. thank you! i love the pp."
duolingo,5,96,"this pp is perfect, just what i was looking for. the as are well controlled too which is great for a free pp, you can learn more than one language at a time. it's simple to navigable, quick to set up. you can compete with friends, there is a top 50 leader board which is set up so it's a random 50 people and not the universal top 50. this makes competing more fun and achieveable. having 5 lives keeps you concentrating. the awards are fun. only bad thing is not all languages test speaking skill"
duolingo,5,5,"an absolutely phenomena educational application. while many sites and courses build their content on technical levels, with everything being taught as machine-like and algorithmic, domingo is a breath of fresh air that truly attempts to imbibe fleecy in its users. it's the difference between translating ""je suis content(e)"" to ""i am happy"" and understanding ""je suis content(e)"" as ""je suis content"". to any one searching for an aid to learning language, with ample practice, do is the way."
duolingo,5,3,"the best way to learn a new language that i've ever tried! i am not good at learning languages, but i actually find myself remembering the lessons from domingo whereas i never could remember anything using other methods. my only complaint is that for spanish it can't understand me when i say ""no, do, tres"" even though i'm pronouncing it correctly - i've had my boyfriend whose first language is spanish try and it can't understand him either; it's just a pitch. overall love it though!"
duolingo,5,3,"engaging and fun way to learn. i am english speaking and use for learning french. good variety of learning technique: listening, repeating back, fill in the blank, translating english to french and french to english, tying and speaking with microphone. able to turn off microphone for one hour if unable to speak that moment or turn off listening if unable to use audit at that time. very thoughtful technique and tips for learning. useful phrases/sentences. definitely 5 star language pp."
duolingo,5,2,"it's so admitting, interactive and fun! and i don't have to sit and wait to keep going if i loose my heart saves, i can just go back and review to gain more myself witch is super helpful and good practice! i would love to see if they can somehow get american sign language as well, this pp and how it's set up would be awesome!"
duolingo,5,3,"how is this pp free? it's soon good! just the free version, on its own, is top notch! i used this pp a couple of years ago and started using it again few months back. the quality has only gone up. when the leaderboard feature rolled in, at first i didn't like it. but now, i log on to the pp everyday and finish my lessons, just to advance to the next league. everything in the pp is so user friendly. the feedback and reminders, not to the mention the weekly reports, are very helpful"
duolingo,5,2,"my kiss love domingo, they learn clot and the as are very short and there are very few, and also the adds dont just random pop up. you can watch as to regain extra hearts, double gems and least one other thing, but they are optional. domingo is best used for my kiss by headphones, but they learn clot. and are very good at their languages for school. you can learn any language even if you want to learn english! you can create a surname. if you play an online game, use your surname easy"
duolingo,5,14,"learning made fun! i've been using this pp about two weeks. i've learned so many words and refreshed the ones i already knew. it's a travel agents must have for learning. i enjoy the stories for extra credit. be sure to log into web page for content that's not on the pp, like stories, dictionary, learned words. it's the first pp i open in the morning and the last before bed. i m paying the $10 for unlimited use. best investment for my mind all year. gracious domingo,"
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp because along with my spanish courses at school, it helps to keep my education going outside of class. i also love how it looks. the way apes look are vital to engaging me in apes. i also love the stories they've added recently. domingo is very positive learning and i love it."
duolingo,5,6,"domingo has been a great learning experience for me. the i looks great , the as aren't terrible, the community is very positive, and progression to a next level feels earned. my two criticisms are that i saw no way to have crowd source lessons made available in pp (which would be useful for specialized fields of work) and that ""on the surface"" community interaction in the pp is very limited; having the ability to send ""drops"" to others in your same banking tier would improve this."
duolingo,5,9,"i've had a lot of fun with domingo! i like the little owl's encouraging messages and the reminders to practice aren't too invasion or insistent. it sounds work but this is honestly the first time in my life where i don't mind being advertised to because i get to choose if i want to see some of them and get gems and hearts to practice more as a reward. i love how it gets you used to twitching quickly between english and spanish, both written, spoken, and usually understanding."
duolingo,5,0,the best language learning application i have ever used. it's free and the material is fantastically done to help you learn fast and remember. it has a huge list of languages. there is one ad at the end of each lesson. so they dont bug you every second. definitely worth more than 5 stars.
duolingo,5,0,"a amazing pp for language learning,easy to use and free!there are some as, obviously,but you can buy a ""paid version"" to remove those as;despite that, it's a fantastic pp,i would recommend it for anyone who is interested in learn a language."
duolingo,5,0,"i love domingo! i especially like two aspects of learning with domingo. first, the program structure allows for several repetition of a new material and that helps in memorizing. the second aspect is a concept of leagues where one can view a progress and compare that progress with others in the same league."
duolingo,5,6,"this is definitely the best pp for learning the spanish language. i have tried many and domingo is the most complete and comprehensive language learning tool i have experienced. yes, at times it seems boring and repetition but unfortunately that is how you learn. the further you go the easier it gets and also do opens more ways to study as you progress. i highly recommend do for anyone who wishes to learn any language."
duolingo,5,4,"the perfect pp for learning and practicing written and reading skill in other languages. the user interface is excellent and intuition, with friendly reminders to practice. i think the pp and the domingo system has been done very well and i would consider going pro if i were more disciplined about practicing! highly recommended, i have done some lessons in a few languages and it is very consistent."
duolingo,5,0,an intelligent and fun way to learn supported by tips and others' useful comments and information aids. love it!
duolingo,5,0,very pleased this far. a little discouraging when you it asks you to take a quit and only 10% of the words on the quit are ones you have learned in the lessons.?.?
duolingo,5,0,love this pp very educational and clear. easy to learn. i have learned a lot and i will keep learning.
duolingo,5,0,great pp for states....it easily teach you an english language in the flow that you really enjoy it.
duolingo,5,0,"easy to use, and, a great sequence and combination of communication phrases both verbal and written"
duolingo,5,0,it is very easy to understand and the interaction is great. no complaints and will spread the word for others to learn.
duolingo,5,0,i'm having fun learning a second language. real easy to use and has leaderboards to make the learning experience competitive.
duolingo,5,6,"this is the best pp i've ever found for learning a language. it is very easy to use, the lessons are easily understandable, the instructions are clear, and the leaderboards make it a fun yet competitive way to learn a language. the only grip i have is the lack of a dark mode, since i use this pp a lot during night time and it blinds my eyes. other than that, the i itself is also fantastic and easy to navigable. i would absolutely recommend this pp to anyone seeking to learn a language."
duolingo,5,3,"this pp has all the learning/ teaching technique, so it's perfect for all earners. it also repeats itself so you don't lose what you've already learned while maintaining the challenge. the only suggestion i have, so far, is to incorporate the macedonian language. there are not many apes available who fully support this language( for ex: there are words but no voice)"
duolingo,5,5,"its a great product for forming a habit of studying language every day. its fun and interactive. it shouldn't be your primary source of language learning if you want to actually learn a language, but it is definitely a great resource. the podcast linked to it is a little too liberal in its stories for my taste but still a good resource."
duolingo,5,0,"amazing pp, but i dont know if i am just insane but i closed the insane option where it said 50 up a day and i did 1100. it will be awesome if you added more please"
duolingo,5,0,"this is best pp for learning languages, it is easy and so fun to learn, i love it"
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp. it's amazing and we can learn any language for free. it also gives you reminders so you don't forget. it awesome i would definitely share this to everyone
duolingo,5,5,"a brilliant pp for languages in my opinion. last year i tried learning japanese with babel (i think) but the just threw words at me, not understanding how the alphabet worked, unlike this which is doing quite a good job of it. i do have one problem though, when faced with the puzzle to choose which sounds fit with each letter, pressing the hiragana letter first causes the sound to be played, which i hope will stop after a while or if there is a setting to turn off."
duolingo,5,2,"i'm learning a lot of vocabulary and verb conjugations. the practice sections are really helpful to review your learning. the discussions explain the why if you get it wrong so you can make sense of the irregulars. i wish there could be some back and forth dialogue. it's fun and easy. i'm really enjoying my ""do"" time!"
duolingo,5,3,"hi, i love this pp so much. it has helped me as i am learning french. i still have time for this despite school, band, practices, and homework. i love how you can change your goal if you are not ready for a higher time limit. also, it is amazing how much i have learned in the past few weeks. on the heart count (your lives) you can practice to earn even more hearts! i love this pp a lot and recommend it to everyone. thank you to the developer because you made a great game for kiss of all ages."
duolingo,5,0,"i've been using this pp for years, starting with the domingo webster version. i haven't always stuck with my lessons, but when i have i've made noticeable progress in my chosen language. even when i stopped for over a year, i hadn't forgotten what i learned. domingo uses the same method as the very expensive roseola stone computer software (immersion), and they do it for free. absolutely 5 stars."
duolingo,5,0,"a totally enjoyable, fast-moving and engaging way to learn a language!"
duolingo,5,255,"this is the best pp to learn a new language! you don't need to pay for any lesson, the application is simple and easy to navigable. i have considered buying the plus version, the exercises and office lessons are great, but honestly, not too much appealing. i think if the application had some grammar, tips or explanations (""ok, you need to speak like this, and the reason is that"") the plus version would be more interesting. it could be a real plus, but the pp is already awesome."
duolingo,5,0,i'm really enjoying learning a new language! it's fun interactive method makes learning new words & phrases a breeze.this language pp us great!
duolingo,5,0,"extraordinary. i have many option of languages to learn by free. besides, the gamefication motivate you to keep going. now coming to the third idiot!"
duolingo,5,0,"it's the best pp out there for learning languages, but it may not be tailor to your learning style."
duolingo,5,0,"domingo makes learning a new language fun, and easy! adding friends and the leaderboards can make for a fun competition, motivation to continue learning."
duolingo,5,0,"for free learning experience that can be tailor to your daily schedule, this is an amazing pp."
duolingo,5,12,"domingo is a very intuition, user friendly and fun to use. i have never got such an experience from a language learning application before. all fall short when compared to that unique fun and game experience it brings to the table. i have been using it for something like over a week and overall i still am amazed at how it makes me want to learn new things each day sometimes multiple times a day. good number of languages available, for now i have been going for german, spanish and chinese."
duolingo,5,0,"an easy and productive way to learn, practice and experience languages. best of all it's free."
duolingo,5,1,very good addition to your language learning routine! the creator really do seem devoted to making language learning both free and fun. the community conversations help for tricky words and phrases. the only issue i've found is words not being fully defined and multiple meanings not always being explained. but this pp is better than the class i took in school and many language learning courses i've played for. very very good- especially for free!
duolingo,5,0,"this pp is perfect if you want to learn a language for free. it makes us practice skill thoroughly in a fun way. i personally am a non-plus user but actually i don't really mind all the as since they're not video. i think that the hearts system is actually pretty beneficial for users since along with making us practice skill, it also makes us know which skill we need more practice for. i love the domingo stories since they're pretty interesting and help us learn new words. great pp."
duolingo,5,4,"the pp is great so far. my only issue is that at some point you are forced to purchase the paid version for a ""free"" trial period. if it is free, why do you need my credit card? then automatically charge me if i don't cancel. not free. now using the pp for a month, l think its great! we are really learning french."
duolingo,5,0,it works well enough but the social aspect really enhanced my learning. mainly for basic level italian revision: i haven't tried learning from scratch.
duolingo,5,3,"i love domingo! it's repetition without being boring, and clearly explains why when i get an answer wrong. it makes learning fun, it's my new favorite game! adds are well placed and not disruption in the middle of a lesson. can be used by anyone who can read, i would recommend domingo to anyone wanting to learn a new language"
duolingo,5,0,"it's exceeded my expectations. i thought it was going to be a bit picked mouse, after all, it's free. it is very thorough and has an intuition structure. i certainly do enjoy the daily lessons and am progressing well. the silly green creature giving the same repeated words of encouragement is the only irritation."
duolingo,5,1,"the pp serves its purpose, you decide if you want to see an ad in exchange of extra life's or points, you can also temporarily disabled speaking exercises if you are in public, so great for all circumstances. i haven't tried the premium mode, but i imagine is even more convenient, but it's a little bit expensive."
duolingo,5,2,great pp for learning a new language. the lessons are fairly easy. if you hover a word it shows all the possible and most probable words it is. only issue i have is since it went premium the as for domingo upgrade are very numerous and annoying. in tired of everything i use or consume for free always trying to get me to upgrade. if i had the money id gladly buy it and the constant reminder that i can afford it kind of keeps me away.
duolingo,5,0,"i download this again after you added scots garlic to your list. i'm learning it through upon and using domingo in between is helpful. there are some bits that are podgy, you have three different dialect which could be confusing for beginners who are looking for consistency. and some of the grammar seems a little podgy. but overall i think it's great, well worth it as a companion pp to other learning."
duolingo,5,3,"honestly, your progress is determined by the amount of effort you dedicate to your goal(s). this application provides you with an amazing tools for bluntly speaking another language. flexible and functional this application contains everything you need to tackle any language spoken today. 5+ stars aren't adequate in my appreciation of the developer. much gracious ;)"
duolingo,5,291,"i really like the fact that domingo in general has improved. they now have stories to practice reading, it's good for building vocabulary, the system they have makes it fun. (keeping streaks, setting your daily challenge) overall, i find it a good tool to help learn a language, not entirely sure whether it can teach the language completely but at the very least, it is a very good stepping stool."
duolingo,5,30,"it's a great, user-friendly pp with a variety of different languages for people of all skill level. the new competitive feature really makes it more fun to learn by competing with local users and banking up in different leagues (bronze, silver, etc.) the pp is completely free, however there are occasional as that last a couple seconds to keep it free. you can pay for the upgrade version which includes all lessons even when office and is ad-free."
duolingo,5,0,"this is the best pp that i ever had used, they develop a plan to keep student focused everyday and keep showing popes everyday to remember you to do you lessons, i had used another apes but none of then are good as domingo. (this english that i'm writing right now, some of it i've learned with domingo, it helps me a lot to learn languages, i'm learning japanese now and is helping me a lot too, it's a complete course which gives you the best way to start learning a language.)"
duolingo,5,0,the way the courses are set up - encouraging lots of repetition without getting boring - is ideal for learning languages mio. i've gone from 0 spanish to feeling confident in conversation in only 3.5 months. the customer service people were amazingly responsive and helpful when i was having trouble dating office courses on domingo plus.
duolingo,5,0,amazing pp that helps learn languages for free. only problem is when u r using it for free you see the as interfering.
duolingo,5,0,"i can't believe this pp, this is free(like literally), very very easy to go with and this is some high quality stuff.."
duolingo,5,0,"it is great, i hope they can office for people who don't usually have wife or internet."
duolingo,5,0,awesome way to learn a language. i just they had more things to buy in the store with the gems u earn.
duolingo,5,0,it is simple to use and short lessons allow you to study for a short time or for a longer duration on any given day. the structure of the profession encourages a user to keep coming back to study.
duolingo,5,0,absolutely fantastic. i've tried a dozen other apes but none teach you as well or as fast as this one!
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp i can learn many languages and its a fun way to study and memories and the best part is that you can test your skill
duolingo,5,0,"really awesome i, easy to use, nice reminders and good content."
duolingo,5,0,"great learning pp. you can learn a new language easily and quick - great if you're going on vacation in another country. however, sometimes when i complete my daily challenge and login the next day it says that i haven't played yesterday and it uses up my streak freeze. please fix this, it's draining my lights."
duolingo,5,6,"now! really good and the voice recognition that was a problem for me was quickly rectified. domingo has been absolutely great since! thank you. it has been well thought through and planned. it is also a great motivation. very, exceptionally good. 🤗 i have recommended domingo spanish and italian to, respectively two further people. thank you! i couldn't have progressed with my learning french without domingo 👍"
duolingo,5,111,"i really enjoy the challenge of staying on a leader board. i've managed to stay on ruby for three weeks now. i love the fact that new more advanced lessons keep on being added and also the stories. i've recommended domingo to lots of my friends. i've managed to maintain a 735 day streak ( with a little help from the occasional use of streak freeze!) just keep doing what you're doing, it's amazing so, much gracious, merci, graze etc! further to my previous review i'm now 882 day streak!"
duolingo,5,15,"the fattest and easiest way to learn a new language! the progress report gives just enough incentive to make sure i log in every day to complete a couple lessons. the only problem i have, is that the competitive banking are so large, it's a list cause to try. five days into the week, i have 150 or so up. i'm in with. second and third sit at about 350 up. first has 1500. so placing high is pretty difficult. even placing high enough to advance to the fourth bracket is pretty involved."
duolingo,5,0,"really great for beginning language speakers. easy, fun and over all pretty great."
duolingo,5,0,i have tried several language learning apes and i like this by far the best. learning is actually fun. thank you for creating such a great pp.
duolingo,5,7,"update, pp was repaired, seems it was a problem for a lot of people. thank you to the developer. pp didn't advance to obsidian league, still stuck in pearl league after finishing #1. this is not cool, it takes a lot of time to advance. it would be nice if developer or goose would contact me about this. i have sent messages to them before about problems. i guess they do not care because the pp is free."
duolingo,5,134,"this pp is awesome. the as don't get in the way, you can comfortably play music in the background and it's not too disruption of that, everything functions well and works fast and it is incredibly adjective. i can't put this down. my only two criticisms are that they don't tell you that you can tap on the english word to see the anti (for japanese) and that i wish they had anti/hiragana charts with stroke order you could download so you could practice writing them out."
duolingo,5,2,"while some bellyache about privacy issues by being listed on a leaderboard or having to pay for a supposed 'free' pp is because they dont think. you dont have to use a real name (mine is scuttlebutt) and you dont have to pay to get more hearts. just review earlier completed lessons to earn more tries. you can also ""cheat"" if you want to call it that by using other sources to help you with answers. its not a closed book test afterall."
duolingo,5,0,love this ...i've learned so much from the webster! i'm just getting the pp again....but i did like the pp before
duolingo,5,7,"i am very pleased with my years of experience with domingo. it has helped me tremendous in my language studies. i recommend this to any language learner or language adduct like me. though, as someone who sometimes stays up late at night studying, i would love the option to have a dark ambled theme. i am greatly appreciative of the staff at domingo, and would like to thank them as they strive to make language learning fun and stress free."
duolingo,5,0,"it's really effective and efficient, the pp takes time to make sure you grasp concepts,spelling , pronunciation and accent of whatever language you decide to learn. using the hearts to learn is a little disadvantaging when they run out but basically it's an impressive pp."
duolingo,5,0,this is hands down one of the best ways i have discovered to learn new languages. i bought the one year plan so that i don't have to deal with tedious as but honesty i think it's worth the price for bordering free quality education. i highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn new languages.
duolingo,5,0,i enjoy the pp because it is easy to learn from it. if you miss something it will go back over it. i am really enjoying it so far.
duolingo,5,0,"easy to use for every age range. i was a bit disappointed with the costumes for do. i expected the character to be wearing it all the time through the pp, not just when it peeped in during lessons. is there a way to show do in their costumes when the pp loads and when lessons load? otherwise i feel it was a waste of gems to purchase them. p.s. your ""hey goose"" ad is obnoxious loud with the bearing trumpet. please find a way to turn down the volume on it."
duolingo,5,1,"great way to learn a foreign language!!!! it's fun and interactive. you earn points, crowns and can compete against others in leagues. the more you learn the more additional features appear so that you are not just memorizing words and phrases but actually able to speak and understand in that chosen language!"
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is an amazing pp for learning languages. i am using domingo for almost two years. now i am learning organ. from the beginning i could write organ words myself but from the first checkpoint it stopped working. so i would be really grateful if it was back because it helped me to remember words. when i am picking the words, i can just remember some letters from it."
duolingo,5,0,"good, interactive, could use ability to go back and correct mistakes."
duolingo,5,0,fun & easy way to learn a new language. wasn't very long before i could understand what they were saying to me. i work on it almost daily.
duolingo,5,0,"i really do like this pp, it really helps to develop your accent in many languages and correct all your grammar mistakes 💞"
duolingo,5,1,there are few apes that i'll take the time to rate. this is one. awesome. i took spanish in high school. but i feel like i have a better grasp on it now (after a few weeks) than an after entire smelter at school. my only suggestion is that there be a little bit more emphasis on grammar at the beginning (subject-verb agreement and etc). i think that part comes later on in the lessons. besides that 9/10 for me.
duolingo,5,2,"this pp is amazing. domingo reaches you hundreds of words in the span of even a day, depending on how active you are. it contains motivation messages and a cut little owl, if that's what the bird is. it contains as, but not video as. it is totally free and you can earn lights to upgrade the pp or the languages, such as adding a whole new subject to the language, like flirtatious phrases and words. it would be better if it was able to be used when you're office, but i understand. 💚"
duolingo,5,1,"i really like the pp but didn't know where to give feedback. i would like to let you know that i love love love the stories that you added. such a fun way and i feel like i really understand the language since i can understand an actual conversation. thank you so much!!! (i don't normally leave reviews, this is in fact my first on here, but i really want to let you know how fabulous this is! so i hope you guns actually read this)"
duolingo,5,12,"it keeps you engaged, learning a new language is about repetition, at first it will seem slow, but after a while it will start throwing some curve balls at you, like similar sounding or written words; it has a nice pacing system and the community gets to chip in with comments on the lessons you are taking. you are both learning how to speak the language and it's grammar and structure, i recommend you give it a go."
duolingo,5,2,"this is an extremely helpful pp and all the lessons you automatically get actually teach you the language. it's super easy to follow along. and it's really fun competing against everyone! i do not recommend using gems to buy their extra lessons the, because their extra lessons dont actually teach the new words to you. they just have you unscrambling sentences and throw a ton of words at you. its unlike the rest of the game, because the rest of the game actually tries teaching you the language."
duolingo,5,23,"i really like this pp. it's helping me walk through languages that i've been wanting to learn, like german, french, and russian. but there are some bags were i'm not getting my achievements, and i don't like the heart system to where if i get one wrong i lose a heart, and after i lose all of them, i have to wait 4 hours to keep learning. i really preferred the last update where the hearts weren't there and that i could continue learning without having to wait a certain amount of time."
duolingo,5,0,"incredibly fast learning and fun. wanted to be able to speak spanish with neighbors and friends. this pp is in small segments that are quick, progress logical, throw in some grammar and provide interesting repetition. i absolutely love this pp and have been encouraging many others to use it."
duolingo,5,506,"it's a wonderful pp, lets you go at your own pace, lessons are replayable so you can go back any time with unlimited replayability, it's responsible programme so it seems to remember what you are getting wrong repeatedly and focused more on those lessons until you get it right, reaches great vocabulary and light grammar, based on how far you want to go you can learn how to properly communicate, or just learn the basis and go with that. it's amazing, 5/5 definitely, it's a great piece of work."
duolingo,5,1,"i hate the as after every lesson. i don't like that grammar isn't particularly taught, just suddenly introduced in a lesson for practice. i have 70000+up in spanish, and 4000+ in french, yet i hated this pp more that i liked it. just my fondness for languages, and it being free (i'm frugal) kept bringing me back. but i just did my first story today, and absolutely loved it. loved it! i think i can endure the as now. good work team!"
duolingo,5,1,"the best experience that i've had in learning something!!!! do thought of everything and it's so fun and interesting!!! i would definitely recommend this pp for every one who are thinking that to learn new language is hard, because it's easier when it's built like a game."
duolingo,5,0,i found using domingo very fun and enjoyable. it reaches you in a way that you can understand and follow easily.
duolingo,5,0,"this might be the best pp i have ever have the pleasure to use in terms of up. the as don't feel intrusion or annoying and following the courses feel effortless. i don't really understand the chest/betting system but the rest of the ""ratification"" elements feels fun and engaging."
duolingo,5,0,easy to play and retain what you learn in a natural and interactive format.
duolingo,5,0,this is an excellent application that helps you learn your desired language in a fun and interactive way that's free.
duolingo,5,0,fun and easy to use. much more effective than using a physical language book.
duolingo,5,1,"easy to use, fast learning, competitive motivation, simply perfect"
duolingo,5,0,"pretty good, still have some mistakes in pronunciation of some word, but not that much"
duolingo,5,0,"amazing pp ,helps clot. good for entry level for learning languages."
duolingo,5,1,its a great pp and i love that its free and comes with a listen along podcast (at least for french and spanish language) one thing that would be helpful if provided by the creator would be a list of reading material appropriate for the level of learning the user is at. in not necessarily saying they should give books out just suggest easy to read books in the language the learner is desiring to learn.
duolingo,5,198,"a wonderful pp for language learning, very structures and formatted, so as to teach you in a methodical and simple way, if you get it wrong, it helps you and repeats. each section is quite short, so it does not become boring, so you can return to any point, as and when you want! i am learning german, whilst my wife is learning french and spanish together. my preference is to use it on my lawton or tablet, as it is easier to manoeuvre around, but of course you can use it on your phone."
duolingo,5,0,"really nice pp, very advanced learning system. would enjoy seeing more achievements or game like features in the future"
duolingo,5,34,"a fun way to learn a language! i have used domingo on and off for years (mostly the desktop version), but i recently redownloaded the pp, and i have been really enjoying it! i like the encouraging messages, and yes, even the in-pp tones. they help keep it interesting and engaging. i am also really pleased with how they do as. i have yet to see any kind of video or animated as; they are always stills, and within the pp (they don't block out your whole screen when they come on)."
duolingo,5,0,"its free, only 1 ad every level, clot of option for languages, and its very fun!"
duolingo,5,3,"i love this pp for a few reasons. its simple to wander through and very flexible. it's also fun to interact with because of it's platforms. speaking, writing, interpreting from english to spanish or spanish to english, it all makes learning fun and quick and the pp gives us goals to set as well so it's like having a personal tutor at the tip of my fingers! love it!"
duolingo,5,2,this webster helped me keep an a in my language classes end after i finish my glasses i was able to get even better at the same witches and even learn more. i'm so glad that japanese is added i've been wanting to learn that language for a long time. i would definitely recommend this to any students and people who just simply want to learn another language.
duolingo,5,1,"excellent free language pp- i am having great results making use of tips and explanations available with each lesson, and following suggestions offered (eg. using headphones to hear the language, writing out sentences at the end of lessons). adore the story lessons. have used do as the base to grow my language learning around, and i use it almost daily, happily."
duolingo,5,0,"fun, simple, the pace is good, and i like the encouragement from the cut little.owl..."
duolingo,5,0,"a fun pp that keeps dating and developing new ways to learn and , a great community"
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is a user-friendly, easy way to learn new languages! i am so impressed by this pp and love using it for just a few minutes everyday to learn!"
duolingo,5,5,had one complaint about settings and i'm pretty sure it wasn't fixed but i found a way around the problem. although every once in a while the pronunciation is a little off. spanish is my gas first language and we have laughed pretty hard a couple times at the way the computer reads a word and it occasional makes me wrong on a listening exercise cut it's not saying what it wants me to hear. but its rare. not enough to disrupt my lessons. i give you 5 stars for bringing the world closer together.
duolingo,5,3,"excellent pp, for me it's been useful for helping me learn spanish. i now can (partially) understand a wide range of new music and writings. the addition of story is also a great feature because it lets you put your new language skill to use right in the pp. no doubt it took some hard work from the domingo team."
duolingo,5,0,"awesome learning pp. the in-pp discussions are very helpful, and the leader boards are fun."
duolingo,5,0,great fun! it's highly adjective... and slightly competitive! challenge yourself to learn more each day!!
duolingo,5,79,"really engaging way to learn a language. takes all the mechanics that most mobile games would use to get you addicted and spend money, but uses them to make you want to learn more about your language. however, it could definitely benefit from a trading system so that the pp can let you know ""hey, maybe you should retro this specific lesson."""
duolingo,5,3,"this pp is amazing. it helps cream the words in my mind, and even gives pro tips! yet, one thing wrong is in the spanish lessons you learn to put in sometimes-unnecessary things. for example: ""to so juan."" the 'to' is not needed, since 'so' already means 'i am'. i'm just assuming that you might say 'to so' to be more formal, maybe? that's what i don't know. otherwise, 5 stars!"
duolingo,5,0,"i'm learning japanese right now on domingo and its really easy to get into. you can start to learn another language if you try this pp. and it really helps if you combine domingo with a couture video on starting that language. plus the free version of domingo doesn't have as all in your face they show you a quick add at the end of a lesson and then it's gone. try it, it's free!"
duolingo,5,1,i want to rate more than 5 stars. this is a game. it feels like a game and it is a lot of fun. when i play it i also happen to learn another language. i learned more spanish in the three days since i download domingo than an entire smelter of an online college class. i do wish this pp could teach proper english writing to a native speaker. overall domingo exceeded my expectations.
duolingo,5,1,"a super fun pp that made spanish easy to learn on the go! definitely worth mind of my time everyday. i got to practice reading, writing and speaking in a fun and interactive way. it cover the key basic topics such as travel and general conversational. you get to pick what level you are currently on which is great as i don't know any basic spanish so i got to learn the school basis before it got harder."
duolingo,5,8,"the way domingo reaches is very good and shows you many sentence examples that will help you make your own in your language of choice. the banking system gives the competitive feel and keeps the interest going. although there are times that it feels grind, but that's how you actually learn the language and be able to speak and write it. i think the office feature is worth purchasing, too. up: i like the new update where i can now see my 'cracked eggs'."
duolingo,5,2,"i love this pp! it makes learning a new language easy and quick, and i find myself spending more time on it than i expected to. there is an option for a premium version of the pp, but the pp isn't designed in a way that it's unable without it. the as aren't intrusion, hearts can be gained with practise, and progress quires aren't really a necessity. overall, amazing pp."
duolingo,5,11,"fantastic. makes learning fun with checkpoints, leaderboards, point systems, badges, positive feedback, and colourful animation. it's structures in a way that feels easy, so you don't feel discouraged or overwhelmed, while still getting results. learning a language requires a lot of repetition. domingo guides you through this while removing the monotony that usually comes with it."
duolingo,5,1,"fairly easy to get into! i'm loving it, i like the streak system because it gives you a reason to practice every day. i think seeing your friends progress (at least for me) makes it so i anna work harder to pass them. also if would and will definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to learn a new language"
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is an excellent pp. the key is to stay consistent and follow the tips about writing down what you learn as you go along through the levels. the pp tracks your progress and gives great inventive to practice. if i could request an additional feature, i'd like an audit/visual section specifically designed, to track nothing but my previously learned words. that way, i can repeatedly review words i struggle with or may forget at my own pace, not just when its auto suggested within the pp"
duolingo,5,1,"really helpful pp. i am using this pp for 1 week now, it's really helping me learn japanese and it have really nice interface.the best thing is that the pp is free and you don't have to give a single penny for learning something. you can't learn other languages using only this pp though. you have to learn from other sources too like couture for better and faster results"
duolingo,5,15,"i'm nearly 60, and this is the first language learning experience i have truly embraced. i am practicing all four language skill at my own pace (intensive!) and feel real progress in just a week. it offers sufficient repetition for duties like me to really get the details into my brain. strongly recommend giving it a try. i also love the extra - the reading, blows, etc."
duolingo,5,0,excellent and easy way to learn other languages. worth every penny.
duolingo,5,0,"a free pp that does all that you need it to! you get to read, write and speak the language which is perfect to help you really learn. i'm acting through it!"
duolingo,5,0,it's a perfect blend of learning a new language & also having fun in the experience. i love doing it regularly!
duolingo,5,0,great pp. really makes learning a new language fun and easy. i would recommend it to anyone who is trying to learn a new language.
duolingo,5,0,"great pp to learn a new language, very helpful and challenging."
duolingo,5,0,"brilliant pp, set out amazingly. you put in what you get out like everything-enjoying the journey thanks to the domingo team (:"
duolingo,5,0,the pp is very simple and easiest way to learn english without any tutor.
duolingo,5,13,"i can't believe this is free! and now i can't believe i went premium, except wait, of course i did! this is a fabulous thing in my life, and when we go to the netherlands next year, i'll be able to read dutch rather proficient and hold some basic conversations. the downside, of course, is that you need to use a language to really know it, and by that i mean converse in it. but i already find myself reading webster in dutch with relative ease after about 10 months. dank je we, do!"
duolingo,5,0,"if you want to practice languages anywhere efficiently i highly recommend this one! excellent liability. it's surprisingly simple to use with its neat design and layout unlike many apes. the exercises, scores and rewards are strategic and motivation. the best free language learning pp i've come across. domingo is the nearest to being entirely free since the free version includes full capacity of all its lessons, while other programs don't let you access full lessons for free."
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp! it helped me learn spanish. my friend sophia starting learning danish as well on this pp! the only thing i need to say is there shouldn't be an option to remove modifications because since i removed modifications i lost inspiration to learn, but i'm starting again! i need to give this pp more than 5 stars! 😃"
duolingo,5,0,this is the best pp ever. so adjective and you can just imagine what that means when the objective is to learn a language!
duolingo,5,0,"i really dont rate apes, but this is a first. very educational, helpful and free."
duolingo,5,9,"the only pp that i've actually managed to use daily. lots of mobile games have rewards for logging in daily and still that doesn't motivate me to do so nearly as much as this pp does. it's super easy to get into and is actually quite fun to learn with this pp. with the daily reminders and the customizable daily goals, it is super easy to keep going. i'm currently on a 100 day streak and have used it every day =d. edit 1: still going strong. i only wish the quires were progress based."
duolingo,5,118,"i have been using this pp for some years. the as did take away time especially for daily lessons so i upgrade to paid version. this pp is really fun to use! i like the rotation of different types of nodules and the quick lesson format, both of which keep me engaged. chasing next level promotion zone is a natural reaction and makes it feel like a game. i is beautiful and mobile game like. i don't like memorizing but this all makes it easier."
duolingo,5,0,"the software have serious problems for play the voices , in fact i can't hear any voice"
duolingo,5,0,i really like domingo i've been using it for just over a year and it's very helpful when you want to learn a new language. the lessons are easy to understand and even if you are having trouble there's an option to ask other people for help. although i am a little scared of the domingo bird this is a very good pp with very few as.
duolingo,5,12,"it really helps me keep up with french ( th grade french) but... it is still really helpful. sometimes there will be an error with the sentence for example, on of the questions translated to ""what is you your name?"" but otherwise it is an awesome pp and i highly recommend it to anyone trying to keep up with homework or learn a new language."
duolingo,5,0,"i have never loved an pp as much as i love do! and the fact that it takes the form of an actual animal, the owl. ❤️ domingo. the stories are really helping me pick up the language faster, that too unconsciously. i just remember a lot of words just from doing the stories. adding more stories would be helpful. the leaderboards end at the diamond league, but i wish they would work on continuing the leaderboards, as in adding more leagues, it kind of motivate you to practice on a daily basis."
duolingo,5,0,"excellent! easy but gives help and printers where needed. simple, helpful and fun"
duolingo,5,0,"excellent pp! it's been incredibly helpful. also, with the addition of stories in the spanish lessons i've been learning much quicker! and as a lesion, it was wonderful to see a story involving two women on their honeymoon! thanks so much do team!"
duolingo,5,6,"it's a great and simple way to pick up a language and practice through your free time. the way the pp is set up makes it very rewarding and educational at the same time. i've been using domingo on and off through my years for different things like french class, then spanish class, and now i'm using it again to learn german for my own purposes, not just a class. i honestly would pick domingo over a private tutor any day because of how convenient it is."
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is awesome, i've had experience with similar apes like memories but it's not even close to do. one of the best things about domingo is the totally free education which is a rare thing these days. as are not annoying and the practice to gain hearts is actually really helpful. i hope you can continue spreading the language knowledge free for ever. best wishes."
duolingo,5,0,"a great free learning pp when i needed in 2017 was one that helped me to talk and understand english, this pp will always stay in my mind."
duolingo,5,4,"i've been using domingo for the past four years (learning german) and honestly it's the best language pp/webster i've ever used. the pp let's you practice wherever, and the webster allows you to read and listen to stories so you can hear actual conversations. it's better to use it while in a class for your goal language, but even on it's own (my high school doesn't offer german sadly) you're able to learn a lot!"
duolingo,5,0,it's a great pp to learn a new language. simple and awesome pp.
duolingo,5,0,really enjoy this pp. the hearts system encourages extra practice. i keep feeling...just one more lesson
duolingo,5,6,"i really enjoy this pp. it is quite repetition by level five of each lesson but as i am in my was and find it hard to remember some of the vocabulary, i find that helps me to learn better. sometimes i wish there was a bit more explanation on some of the grammar elements as you have to try and figure out why you got a translation incorrect. i use the free version and top up my lives between lessons on the practice sessions. i like that you can practice completed lessons without losing lives"
duolingo,5,8,"i have been using this pp for two days now and find it extremely easy to understand. it uses a way of learning that fits multiple different people's needs such as auditory learning, written word, reading, excetera. it uses things in context in ways that make it so you can understand the words and the letters of different alphabet that you want to learn! i'm currently learning japanese and for the first time in a while i feel like there's progress thank you domingo!"
duolingo,5,3,"i've used other similar but computer based language programs. what makes domingo so good is having it on my phone so it's always with me. it's optimized for smart phone use, and i can fill in any free time, during lunch, or whenever to practice and study. new words are highlight with drop down definitions. i do wish there was an index of words for review."
duolingo,5,3,"love it! i had done some learning before with audible, but this has been so much better. it warns you of accents on letters and i'm just doing the nodules i want....i don't need to know about grandparents or school stuff so i can dip in and out. the lessons may be slightly repetition but that's good....i'm learning a lot and in just a short few minutes a day!"
duolingo,5,5,"very well designed pp. love the leader board, streaks, achievements, and up for added motivation and enjoyment. the content is great and in learning fast. i also like the idea that you can get the plus version by sending a link for other players to join. overall this is a much better pp than i had expected it to be."
duolingo,5,91,"this pp is a great learning tool. i successfully learned 25 words, definition and proper usage, in 29 minutes. the short lessons let you learn on the go for free. no dealing with large course fees, transportation, due dates or the pressure of dancing, time consuming assignment. they're quick, effective lessons that won't overwhelm or interfere with your other daily responsibilities. hopefully they'll branch out into other subjects as well."
duolingo,5,0,"this is a great pp if you want to learn. it seemed slow initially but as i continued i began to see and appreciate the repetition. it introduces material slowly and has you practice, practice, practice. that is what i needed when i was taking spanish classes, but never took the time. thank you domingo."
duolingo,5,2,"¡much gusto! domingo is a way of learning languages and doing so in the go. but it's more than reading the words. you can learn key phrases, practice speaking them, listen to podcasts, the features are pretty deep for a learning pp. therefore, if you want to brush up on a new language or refresh after some time away from speaking that language, domingo is the best pp to date...a modern day roseola stone for the digital age."
duolingo,5,0,"i hope that by ""bags,""you are referring to the vertical display of lessons for tablet users. i love domingo plus and have been using it for years. it is one of the joys of my life. if it can't be fixed i will have to live with it. i'm not going anywhere. but i would love to be able to use it as it was in the beginning, a horizontal keyboard. i would still recommend domingo to anyone who wants to learn a language. once kent"
duolingo,5,0,i've had a wonderful experience with domingo as an pp and language teacher. does exactly what it says on the tin. i only wish it had a word library for the language you're studying so you can see all of them and which ones are struggle with the most. i had thought they had such a feature in the past.
duolingo,5,0,the program has been fun. it could use a better vocabulary list to view before the lesson.
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp. it is a very straightforward language learn pp and doesn't seek to completely ""ramify"" the experience but it still manages to keep my interest and motivate me to keep learning, practicing, and progressing. plus i feel oddly encouraged when the little owl pips out and says nice things."
duolingo,5,0,very good quality language learning software! good for gaining speaking skill along with learning the little things to becoming client in a language. the only downside is the 5 heart health system. i would much prefer to learn without using a health system.
duolingo,5,0,this is a great pp for the new years because my resolution was to learn a new language and this pp is helping me meet that goal!
duolingo,5,0,a very fun way to learn and practice a foreign language! truly motivation! i definitely recommend this!
duolingo,5,0,this is a very very very good language learning pp. i love it. it's the best pp for free learning. thanks for the owners of this pp.
duolingo,5,0,very good. as are annoying though and you keep losing progress when you are interrupted
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp. i've already began speaking short sentences in my job at the hospital in less th a's n 2 short weeks.
duolingo,5,0,great pp. it makes learning a different language fun and enjoyable.
duolingo,5,0,it's very easy to build up skill on any language through the apes as it guide you systematic way .
duolingo,5,0,i love this language pp and the fact that you don't have to pay for premium to learn any language you want. i really appreciate that. :)
duolingo,5,0,"it's nice pp to start learning a foreign language...easy , interactive and engaging"
duolingo,5,0,this pp is great! makes me feel that i can learn new languages very easy.
duolingo,5,0,great way of learning languages!! definitely recommend it!!
duolingo,5,1,domingo is to the point and easily accessible. navigation easy.
duolingo,5,0,"fun and easy way to learn a language. i've been learning irish for a while now. just wish they had scottish garlic. that would make me love it with nothing ill to say about it. edit: scottish garlic for english speakers is here! but i'm not happy about clubs being gone. i miss it. that's one of the only reasons i can think of for why i wouldn't like it. p.s. i'm on andros, so there is no heart system."
duolingo,5,0,"i love it so much😀!!!!! i like how they added so many more languages 🇮🇹🇳🇱🇱🇷,so i can learn lots of them.in school i learn french and with domingo i can get a higher mark. but i don't like how you added a heart❤ ,now i can't play for long because it takes away a heart every time i get a question wrong.if you only have 1 heart left and your half way through a lesson,and make a mistake you have to pay or you quit the lesson and i can't pay so i have to quit. 😣😭 but the rest of it is good."
duolingo,5,2,"very well done, it is rare to see an pp providing such comprehensive teachings and exercises for free (there are many stages and each has a few levels so you can be familiar with what you have learnt)... and each exercise is short, which makes it handy for those who are busy (i use this pp while i am traveling to school) i highly recommend this pp to you all :d and am currently learning german, good luck to you all!"
duolingo,5,3,"this is a great system. good use of different tools to match preferred learning style. liked the fun and the competitive elements coupled with in pp incentive. also it really works. i have tried many language learning systems and this one has delivered more progress in a couple of months at half an hour a day (more if i am having lots of fun), than others achieved with me in a couple of years! top marks domingo! spanish next! or maybe italian, or irish....."
duolingo,5,0,"i honestly thought i wasn't going to learn anything and that this pp would be super hard, but honestly i feel like its taught me so much in so little time. it's easy to use and it's fun!"
duolingo,5,0,its so exciting. its like a game. learning have never been so easy and so much fun. great pp
duolingo,5,0,"i love the pp and i've only had for about a week. one small question, is it normal that for organ alphabet lesson 3 i keep getting questions about cities and starbucks? i had those at basis 1 (borrowed words)"
duolingo,5,1,"it is great using domingo on andros and computer and it can help you learn a language free no matter you are a beginner or not. there are many languages to learn and i really suggest clinking on tips to learn deeper. it helps you listen, speak, read and write and when you need more real communications, you can join events at your neighborhood. love it a lot."
duolingo,5,0,i personally love it it's a nice language learning pp but to really benefit you must use it regularly
duolingo,5,0,very helpful for practice and we can also learn any languages easily.
duolingo,5,2,"i'm a beginner learning french and i love this pp. i am quite competitive so this pp is great for my learning because it allows me to ""compete"" with others in getting to the next ""level"". i also really like a possibility of practicing different nasal sounds that are so difficult about french (there are exercises that get you to recognise very similar sounding combinations of letters and there are also opportunities to pronounce words and phrases where it tells you if you got it right or not."
duolingo,5,0,"i really love this pp , it's truly amazing you can learn so many languages with easiest ways and how it encourages you! , i personally love french and i tried learning it and i can say i can talk in it good not client yet but it's truly incredible . i recommend using it cause it's truly amazing and easy to use. thanks for making this pp💕"
duolingo,5,1,"interesting approach, and it works! you learn a foreign language without even noticing it 😆 personally i'd love a bit more grammar (a lot of it, actually) but then again, domingo helps you getting accustomed to the new language well enough so it's up to you to go even further..., like, for instance, to study it at any superior (academic) level you'd like. and, quite important, it sports such a lovely interface :) great job, domingo!"
duolingo,5,0,great experience and a fun way to learn. it would be greater if the pp does not stop sending modifications after a few days and maybe a little bit of change concerning the content of the notifocations would be greater as well. thank you!
duolingo,5,1,"fantastic way to learn another language i have had a really hard time in other classes and programs learning spanish, but this is actually enjoyable and game like that it makes it easy to learn, it's also really repetition to where the farther you get in you feel like you naturally know the words, and it's legitimate free where you're not wrapped into not exceeding without upbraiding. highly recommend."
duolingo,5,0,"i picked up the pp to refresh my high school french, and it has been efficacious. i've been mostly taking very small, sub-10-minute lessons, improving slowly with practically no impact on my schedule, but i expect it would also support a far more focused effort, with the quit, stories and podcast functions they've added."
duolingo,5,0,excellent. only wish the stories were longer. and an interactive vocal list.
duolingo,5,1,"domingo has been a useful and nicely structures way to keep myself involved daily with the languages i enjoy. by itself it probably won't make you client, but combined with some classes or tutoring it is a nice way to practice and learn. there are some pretty frequent jokes to purchase the upgrade, but they are not obnoxious and the free version is pretty powerful."
duolingo,5,0,"a great way to learn and practice languages. some things needed: 1. some better explanations on grammar rules, especially ones in the learning language but not present in the native language (e.g. formal). 2. it would be nice to change the colour slightly on the entry box depending on whether the learning or native language is required. so many times i enter the wrong language. 3. where's tagalog? it seems there are filipinos wherever i travel and there over 100m native speakers."
duolingo,5,0,excellent interface. well paced lessons. endure that you correct your mistakes.
duolingo,5,0,"great tool for beginners to get familiar with the basis and to develop confidence while learning a new language. reading, writing, listening and speaking are involved in the process, which makes it more fun and engaging. all gradually and at the pace you choose. thank you for all the work you've done refining this pp."
duolingo,5,7,"absolutely love this pp. when you have trouble with words or phrases, it gives you questions containing them more frequently so that you can correct your problem areas promptly. even drops in for a few little ""congress on your hard work!"" messages as you practice. its a very comfortable, fun and easy way to learn a language."
duolingo,5,1,"although its an awesome language learning pp, but sometimes during in any particular section of language, it goes few steps ahead without the person who is learning having any clue for it, so i would just like to suggest that, it would be nice if you make or sections easier and dont advance rapidly to another step without clearing up all the previous doubts"
duolingo,5,10,"really good language learning pp. there are a few issues that could be improved. sometimes it assumes you've already learned a word and asks you what it means. i already knew some of the language i am learning so it didn't happen often. this is great at teaching you how to read, spell and speak the words. not great for grammar and reasons why things are done a certain way."
duolingo,5,1,"domingo is easy to use and a great way to learn a language or refresh one's knowledge through short daily exercises. it's good if you just want to learn a language to communicate in it but if one wants to understand it more from grammatical point of view, one has to use other apes, webster or books. however, this is not a flaw as it is not it's purpose."
duolingo,5,13,there is not enough space in this comment section for me to express how much i love this pp!! i've been using domingo for 2 years now and haven't had any problems or unexpected clashes. this pp works fearlessly! oh and you will learn the language you choose. couldn't be easier! best educational/language learning pp available on any platform. i love domingo!!!
duolingo,5,10,"amazing. i love it! it's fun & i look forward to using the pp daily. i'm a complete beginner and really feel like it has helped me read, write, and say words in spanish little by little. i'm confident i can become client or get close to it if i keep at it. my boyfriend also has the pp and enjoys it. he encouraged me to use it. he uses it to brush up on his spanish so he can help me if i have questions. i like how you can add friends through the pp and see how they are doing."
duolingo,5,2,"this pp is really great! but i really would like if the time if the lives (in the premium version) will be shorten a bit because i'm always studying the course that i picked everyday when i have time. and it turns out that i really have many time to study the courses that i chose. it's okay though, since the practice also helps me get better. i really love this pp since it makes my studying in languages is better that the other apes that i have tried."
duolingo,5,0,"super helpful, one of the best apes out there to learn a new language from scratch"
duolingo,5,0,"no. 1 pp for learning new languages hands down, although some languages are a little only they have a great feedback system"
duolingo,5,0,great pp. i use it when i have free time instead of wasting my time on other social media platforms
duolingo,5,0,"the best way to start. i will recommend something like some grammar pills, but the rest is just perfect."
duolingo,5,0,"very easy to use pp, extremely well thought out engagement approach to keep the user engaged."
duolingo,5,0,steady pace which suits me. clever use of learned words. would recommend.
duolingo,5,0,"very easy to use, and i'm actually learning the language. highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn a new language in just a few minutes a day."
duolingo,5,0,i breaking love this pp! i've been able to learn welsh and the use of visual really helps!
duolingo,5,0,exceptional but though the letters are bit confusing in terms of survive or book type.
duolingo,5,6,"i love learning languages on domingo. i've tried irish, german, italian, organ, polish and greek so far. only thing i'd like more of is more pronunciation help in the lessons. for a free pp, this one is great! ok, when i actually took the time to click on every possible thing in pp, i found pronunciation help and extra guidance upon clinking the light bulb icon. perfect."
duolingo,5,0,"update, great pp, very user friendly making learning fun. i have learned so much spanish in so little time, recently however i have been unable to access lessons when office, though i am a plus subscribe. i have contracted domingo support, but not heard back yet. this is particularly important to me as i travel a lot and it would be useful to use the pp when on a long flight"
duolingo,5,0,awesome experience. it gets the job done slowly but surely. anyone determined can learn a language for free! i highly recommend domingo to anyone.
duolingo,5,1,"accessible, effective, and fun. the graphics and voices are pleasant. good variety of ways to practice, with the option to test out of basic levels when ready. there are just enough game-like features to motivate extra study. for example, errors cost ❤️; i love that you can earn extra ❤️s by practicing. awards for ""streaks,"" consistency, etc. as appear regularly in the free version, between lessons, clearly identified. watching video as is optional, and ears gems you can spend in the game."
duolingo,5,0,i feel relaxed and confident when using domingo and am surprised at the amount of vocabulary i've learnt in such a short space of time.
duolingo,5,2,"well designed pp, that works very efficiently and which has finally made some basic rules of latin stick in my memory. the only complaint is, apart from italy and rome, the use of mostly i american place names, which won't ever come up in classic or ecclesiastical latin literature, which is what i at want to be able to read eventually."
duolingo,5,224,i love this pp! it feels like a game which actually does makes learning the language fun. i really like that if you run out of hearts you're able to gain more by doing a practice round.. it forces you to go over the same words and phrases and verb tense over and over in order to continue and it makes retaining the information very easy. i'm 2 weeks into learning german and can't believe how much i've retained.
duolingo,5,0,easy to use interface and fun challenges make domingo represent a significant help for learning vocabulary of a language. should be treated as a compliment to other methods of language learning and not a standalone tool. on a 1010 day streak now with no signs of stopping! overall a great companion tool for language earners.
duolingo,5,0,the best pp to get the basis of a language. it makes it quite fun and the league can sometimes really motivate :)
duolingo,5,0,"this is the best game ever! this is the first time i see a language learning game that doesn't need to be paid. at first, from what people were saying on couture, i thought at first this was a horror game until i searched up 'language learning' this was the first thing that came up. keep up this great game!"
duolingo,5,0,"just getting started, but the best part seems to be that i can squeeze in 5 minutes of practice anywhere."
duolingo,5,0,great pp to learn a language quickly! cuts to the chase
duolingo,5,1,"this is a delightful pp that build up my language skill in a fun way. i stated from nothing and i'm learning very quickly, enjoying it all along. i've been learning for nearly two months now and still enjoying it a lot. today i discovered the story section on the webster, which is lots of fun now that i've learned quite a bit of vocal."
duolingo,5,0,"i love working on this (almost) every day. refreshing my spanish over the last year has been great. recently i started scottish garlic which is so much fun. dear do, for languages like garlic it would be very helpful to have an audit also on the pick one of three tasks. and i would love a course in mori and one of token's pelvis languages. thank you for providing free and fun education :)"
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is great! this is not a helpful review because there would be so much stuff to say about how awesome it is! so i am not going to list all that stuff that would persuade you to get the pp. i am just going to say that i highly recommend it, especially if you are a student currently learning a large like me."
duolingo,5,0,great pp. maybe add some more languages. but overall it is good.
duolingo,5,0,"really excellent pp. it really has helped me learn french in a simple, fun way. love ❤️ the heart system...awesome and free!"
duolingo,5,0,"so far it's working pretty well. i like the different ways you practice and learn vocabulary and sentence structure. it sometimes feels repetition, but hey that's how you learn. i also like the environment (the podcast and things) that let you experience the language in different ways."
duolingo,5,0,"this pp is so incredible, because you can learn more languages, and is so funny to use!"
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is a very easy pp to use it helped me learn new words, but the hearts kind suck but they do have practice on domingo witch i do every day! i recommend learning bowels and continents first it really helps!!! but i definitely recommend this pp for anyone."
duolingo,5,0,"it's the most helpful and the best language application i've ever used and been using it for 1 year now. only got one problem in its new update about the sound of the word; when i click on the words to listen to, no sound is played. appreciate if this problem can be fixed. big thanks to domingo's team♥️"
duolingo,5,116,"this pp is by far one of the best things i've ever download. not only has do convinced me to stop wasting time watching brain-dead couture video, i can now actually speak in a different language! also the whole stories feature is great as it gives a fairly good stimulation of how conversations are held, which in turn is vital for becoming proficient in a language."
duolingo,5,0,fun and easy to use. very practical for language learning.
duolingo,5,0,domingo is the best free language learning pp i've used. it's efficient for what it is and is still growing as they update it. i'm actually learning. thoroughly enjoy!
duolingo,5,0,this pp is amazing at helping me learn a foreign language! so many to choose from and they make it fun! would recommend 100 percent!
duolingo,5,0,easy to use and provides the necessary repetition for learning a foreign language.
duolingo,5,0,awesome the best pp for studying new languages. it provides speaking and writing exercises and new vocabulary words to learn. i just want dark mode pus
duolingo,5,0,it's very educational and guides me at a slow pace and it's an excellent language learning experience
duolingo,5,0,love this pp it is great! works very well for understanding words!
duolingo,5,0,why i can't hear the pronunciation? i reinstate the pp but it doesn't solve the problem.
duolingo,5,0,great free pp. i am very quickly brushing up on my spanish with their easy to follow and multi dimensions lessons.
duolingo,5,0,set up just like those adjective games but learning quickly at the same time. i can't wait each day for a moment to play again.
duolingo,5,0,"i enjoy these podcasts- varied subjects give the opportunity to learn diverse vocabulary; the true stories are inspiring, they spread progressive ideas and/or give a good insight into latinoamerican ways of life, culture, history but also of difficulties these countries encounter nowadays."
duolingo,5,1,"i prefer the old version that doesn't have lives, the reason i use domingo is because you don't need lives like all the other language learning apes. with the current version, nothing is special about it please get the original with lights instead of gems and no need for live, it without these doesn't set domingo apart from any other language learning pp."
duolingo,5,0,great pp and you get a good amount of tools for free. the only issue i have is that for languages i've studied before its hard to find the right placement for myself. some skill are high level other parts low so i don't know how to assess myself. the tool itself is wonderful!
duolingo,5,0,"it is a great software. but i have a request. i didn buy the software but using it by watching adds.can you please let us use the nodules office which ever we already completed (because, as we have already supported your good pp by watching required number of adds for those completed nodules)...i think in this way you can more promote your good work towards free education. thank you in advance..."
duolingo,5,0,"i am finding the pp easy to navigable. if you're not a paid subscribe there is a free practice option that gives you extra time to really learn what you have done during a lesson, when you run out of hearts. it is great so far! i am learning and pretty quickly it seems. i love this pp so far!"
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp. it's so much fun, smart and easy. and i am really learning! si, si, es may buena! here's an update five months later: i have been using the plus version and practicing daily and have learned so much. i highly recommend this program."
duolingo,5,0,"i'm not very good with learning new stuff but this has helped me beyond my dreams. i know many people can just go and not look back but i have to frequently go back and do it all again and again and again. and i'm able to keep visiting the areas i need to the most. thank you for making a program that i can work on at my desire. i know there are others like me out there, well this is what you need if you truly want to learn other languages. good luck and keep going forward."
duolingo,5,0,"it really helps with learning a language, if you want to learn a language for free just click on the pp."
duolingo,5,0,"this a well designed pp that not only reaches you a language but encourages you to keep practicing skill you've already learned so you don't lose them. and it does it all for free. yes, there are adds but they don't take away from the experience. i'm having fun learning a language and i didn't think that would ever happen."
duolingo,5,0,"easy to operate, mostly very accurate - a boon to learning a language!"
duolingo,5,5,"a current difference with the desktop version is that it costs five lights to test out of a level, but you can also earn double lights for watching an add. the desktop version currently costs no lights to test out, and there are no video as. if you are in bed you can tell it you can't listen or speak now and audit questions will be suspended for an hour. once you hit checkpoint one you can read stories. in the german course they are cut and humorous. the whole learning experience is great!"
duolingo,5,0,"i think it's awesome, i'm really learning! there could be more peaks with the paid version though :)"
duolingo,5,0,"a very smart pp. play with a benefit, learn in an easy, fun way."
duolingo,5,2,"it's great, but i wouldn't call it perfect, however, for learning languages like german, english, swedish, russian, chinese, arabic and more, domingo is perfect for getting a very good understanding of whichever language you're trying to learn. and i appreciate them having option like naval and hawaiian, so domingo, rock on!"
duolingo,5,0,"this is hands down the best pp or technique i've used for learning a new language...i did rossetta stone for months and only retained a fraction.... still early in getting serious with learning, but so far i'm finding myself recognizing things and instantly translating them not just remembering that a symbol means something in my native tongue but actually picturing the thing in my mind sans english word!"
duolingo,5,0,i like the pp they make it easy and fun to learn and they really work with you in trying to progress.
duolingo,5,2,"having been using it for more than one year, i am really impressed by domingo for its concise and smart layout, systematic course design and various incentive to help you progress! recently i just got the new offering of short stories, really love it! the stories are funny and very useful!"
duolingo,5,1,"native english speaker in the us. i've been using domingo for years! after i took german in high school, i wanted to continue learning. the most recent update added ""stories"" & that has been the best thing it's ever had. this let's you read, & hear, a realistic conversation between people. the words can then be tapped to review what they mean, & you learn a lot through the context! i've been very pleased with it as a basic learning course, but be sure to use external material to learn!"
duolingo,5,0,"like that it provides exercise with different language skill, including not only vocal exercise, but also listening and speaking practice. like that it even has speaking practice with a voice detection function to see if the pronunciation are correct. would be great if there are more advanced levels of learning."
duolingo,5,0,honestly a fun and easy way to learn something so very very valuable!
duolingo,5,1,just started as a beginner but so far it seems to be teaching in a way that i retain because i am already able to use what i have learned to start communicating with my much more advanced wife. it is very fun so far. you have to remember to fill your heart health to make sure you don't lose your progress!!!
duolingo,5,0,absolutely amazing! i love this pp. it makes learning languages fun and effective.
duolingo,5,3,i've only been using domingo for a few days but i enjoy every second. it can be quite repetition but i'm sure that's why it's effective. the way the exercises vary in format help with true comprehension. so far i love it! will probably pay for the plus version without adds.
duolingo,5,0,"it's great. it takes its time to teach you slowly. before each lesson you can click a little icon and it gives you a renown of what you'll be learning. i'm about 1 month into my german lessons and i feel confident that if i stick this out, it would only take a few more months for me to feel comfortable holding a conversation."
duolingo,5,0,love how it progresses in difficulty and provides different ways to learn.
duolingo,5,11,"i like the fact that i can be learning while waiting for the elevator or the train. the step by step and repetition help a lot! and i love the new feature of speaking into the microphone as a test question. that's awesome! i wish i could be taught some words before being tested on them. but often times, one can press on the word for the translation so that helps."
duolingo,5,0,lots of fun and learning a new skill. as adjective as a game. really great.
duolingo,5,1,"wonderful, i'm loving it, easy to use and you have taken many efforts to teach the languages that's really awesome. plus everything's free 😇now. only one concern, please make available more practice for speaking, otherwise learning, reading,writing is very nice and easy to understand. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 rest all the available features are too good🔥"
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp, i've been on it for about an hour and already know a lot of basic swedish and i find it very fun, i also love how practicing more can get you more hearts to practice more. it makes it really easy and i'm really proud of myself."
duolingo,5,4,i would like for italian & japanese to be added to domingo stories. it's a pretty useful tool. i've been using it for spanish & it helps me better understand the language more than the regular way of studying with domingo. the regular way is also good. but seems like more of a way to reinforce what i've learned for me. so i wouldn't want to get rid of the regular way.
duolingo,5,0,"nice pp, learning easy and fun and helps to learn different languages and u can take 4-5 languages at one account, the best facilities of this pp are we can take many language on one account, makes learning easy and fun for free, it freeze but get back to normal at 4 seconds! you can definitely download this pp💝💝💝👏👏👏👍👍👍👌👌👌👌 domingo makes learner understand the language by it's source. domingo doesn't contains much as and makes learning easy, fun and you can trust this is best"
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is a really good pp. it was recommended by one of my friend. easy to use and understand the system as well. it'll be better that can connect with friends live, such as live chats, audit calls.from that we can resolve our language matters with natives."
duolingo,5,0,"i love it because the hearts make you focus more and its so easy to learn and how you can learn multiple languages on the same pp its just a perfect pp and i love it and so do all my friends! i shared this pp with my friends and my family ,my sisters are learning japanese and my dad is learning french to!"
duolingo,5,0,"really great! you practice reading, hearing, and speaking ...immersion"
duolingo,5,0,"great: easy to use, fun and thorough at the same time."
duolingo,5,0,this pp has been great. a very easy way to ease into learning a new language.
duolingo,5,0,it was very nice i spend more than oh a day on this pp but now sometimes it doesn't work do not unload pictures and not playing the voices plllleeeeaaaaazzzz fix the buzz
duolingo,5,0,"domingo has been quite helpful, precise and easy to use."
duolingo,5,0,very engaging and adjective. college language classes should take some notes.
duolingo,5,0,great pp for learning a language at your own pace.
duolingo,5,0,simple. fast. easy. just like a language learning pp should be.
duolingo,5,0,"absolute beast. now it's updated like the is version and has all the web features on it. super fun to use to learn a language. but always remember that you need be following a course as well. this application can be used just for learning new words sentence formation, not for learning proper grammar."
duolingo,5,3,"i love this pp, but i do have a few ideas: 1) have personal data (e.g most up earn in one day, longest streak, etc) accessible so that we can compete with ourselves as well as others; 2) give us proper profile pages which could display this data publicly, including information about how long we have been using the pp and similar details; 3) let us set goals, eg no. of crowns in amount of time and give us ways to track our progress on these goals. thank you for putting stories on the pp!!!!!"
duolingo,5,0,"really helpful and instructive. easy to follow with target to aim for. as an older person, whose memory is not as it once was, the lessons are very constructive and encouraging. really enjoy it and would recommend it to anyone to give it a go."
duolingo,5,0,it's a fabulous pp i'm learning french and the way you learn is great with a very good recalling of your lessons ...love it !!
duolingo,5,0,such a great pp. makes learning fun n and unapproachable! i'm hooked :)
duolingo,5,0,"love this pp with the little green owl who misses me if i stay away too long! like my cut little muddy who reminds me to keep practicing my spanish! fun, realistic and practical exercises to get you learning quickly!"
duolingo,5,1,"i like the way this pp makes learning possible in those few little minutes of your day between the bigger jobs. it all adds up. there are a few minor bags in some lessons, but nothing that really inhibit enjoying the learning process. deserved popular and recommended."
duolingo,5,0,"since domingo is so well established and probably the best pp for learning foreign languages, perhaps it's time to supplement some parts with some grammatical explanations about the various linguistic phenomena (such as common tends) for the additional benefit of the learner."
duolingo,5,0,"pretty good pp. but should show the translation of the words you are asked to recognise by sound, as is meaningless if you don't know what they are...and goose doesn't or can't translate either, as that's not that good either! so, you don't improve on the wee words!! otherwise, am enjoying and am learning."
duolingo,5,0,absolutely one of the best apes for learning different lingo.. definitely easy to use and learn from.
duolingo,5,0,"found this pp brilliant to use in learning a new language. good repetition, and introduction to new words plus the encouragement of practice hearts to progress with learning. you can also slow down the speech to make it easier to translate to your chosen language."
duolingo,5,0,great pp. although i am just at the beginning stages of learning it is fun and information
duolingo,5,1,"currently am unable to hear the choice of sounds at the start of each lesson. the audit description comes through fine, but the four option are not spoken once pressed. otherwise great. really like the restore function for completed lessons to ensure you don't leave behind previously learned content."
duolingo,5,5,this pp has been great at motivation me to learn a new language as well as refresh me on languages i've learned a little. i'm also learning new ways to say things in languages i was already familiar with. for beginners i strongly recommend that you click the lightbulb before starting a lesson test. the lightbulb takes you to a page that explains the lesson. most seem to miss that aspect of domingo and get upset when they are immediately asked about words and phrases they don't know.
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp i am learning french, spanish and welsh and i never dreamed of learning any language. it not got a lot of as and is a fun way of learning. if you want feedback i would add little games in between to help you and to know what you struggle with. one of the favourite apes in my phone. download it now !!! ❤️📱❤️📱❤️📱❤️📱❤️📱❤️📱❤️"
duolingo,5,0,"fantastic pp, very straight forward and easy to understand."
duolingo,5,0,"i love learning on here, it helps with all the relation. one thing i would be nice to add is if there was a section with all the words we learned, definition and translation. so that way for those of us who don't write it down we still have a section to go back to and practice!"
duolingo,5,0,great way to learn or refresh a language. great for daily use.
duolingo,5,1,"this pp is really helping me practice and learn in a simple graceful way! i'm really grateful for the flow of the lessons, and the convenience of learning from my phone whenever i please. thank you thank you thank you. i have only been using it for about a week and i'm already understanding and speaking more espanol. 💛🌵"
duolingo,5,0,it is super easy to use the free version. also to practice to re up your health. the grammar is a bit funny. i am practicing ukrainian. i have a friend who first language is ukraine. he says it is good. so far it is a good pp. i will update my rating after further use. i am rate 21 in banking so far. :)
duolingo,5,0,"i've been hooked on this for a few days now. i've lived in china for a few years, mingled in japanese in college, and had a couple of awesome russian roommates. this pp is great for touching up on languages i haven't spoken in a while and has been teaching me russian at a surprising pace (cyrillic is no joke). sometimes i put in an answer that should be accepted but it's not for some reason; that happens once in ~150 questions or so. not a big deal. oh, and it's 100% free"
duolingo,5,0,"i've download this pp for three times but at each time the sound of this pp become mute ,could you guide me to solve this problem?!"
duolingo,5,0,"intuition, fun, and interesting. top notch, superb - five stars, hands down! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
duolingo,5,0,"solid start in domingo. started with spanish, to which i did have some previous experience learning. though it never really took back then. it seems to be taking now. not sure yet if that's because of the previous base and the ten thousandth time is the charm for me, or if these short, repetition, simple lessons really help build an understanding. i'm willing to give domingo the credit! overall it's still a more fun method of learning than spanish 1 in school or random learn spanish d's."
duolingo,5,0,"pp is fully free, there are as to support the pp, but it's not intrusion or anything. the pp is also good and very well done. the only ""bad point"" is the lack of explanation, so i would say that if you are really planning to learn, it's a side tool :)"
duolingo,5,2,from my experience domingo is actually a very good way to learn a foreign language. you can use the pp really intuitively and the teaching structure leads to quite fast learning progress. the pp is fun to use and i personally like the separation into different topics and everyday situations. it's overall a nice and interesting way to learn a new language or improve your knowledge about your current foreign languages.
duolingo,5,1,i was first in the league to progress to sapphire and yet it didn progress me and instead i start all over again???? makes me upset keeping hard with the goals yet being thrown off like that. as sad as it is i know how hard the people working there so regardless of that this pp is top notch.. i'm sure it'll get fixed!
duolingo,5,0,greatest way to learn a language. i love the plus version so i am able to go for an hour. it becomes repetition a little but that's what you need! i've had to speak with people who speak spanish to fully understand why a certain word is used or grammar stuff. but overall it's great for learning words and common sentences.
duolingo,5,0,this pp is great! they take it slow and help you when you make a mistake by repeating what you missed up on! love the encouragement that the little owl gives!:) recommend this pp to anyone who wants to start learning a language they're not familiar with! they take you from mild to master with what they teach you:) recommend patience with it too and to not expect yourself to be great at it all at once. take your time:) you can always repeat the lesson!:)
duolingo,5,0,"i've a fair bit of language learning experience, and domingo is very good indeed. firstly, it's not just french/german/spanish/italian courses - many more languages, some quite obscure. i've always laughed at courses with almost-nonsensical sentences (eg, ""the blue mouse is in the trap""), but such tests make you think about *every* word, and not just guess by context. i do some every day, and am nearly 8 months in the hungarian course, and i'm loving it. thanks, domingo owl, you're the best."
duolingo,5,0,i absolutely love the stories. good listening practice and very funny. poor sector
duolingo,5,0,"hands down the best way to learn a language that i have found. it's easy, well rounded, and it works. they have some great option of languages to learn, but also hoping they continue to add as i want to learn bulgaria. still, i could not have made the jump to learn norwegian, german, irish, and garlic without them! highly recommend. if you're on the fence and want to learn a language, look no further."
duolingo,5,1,"fun to play with. excellent content. i'm using it to consolidate my french, refresh my japanese and learn arab (almost) from scratch. sometimes repetition, perhaps, but going through the same (or similar) drill several times helps you develop automatisms and improves your spelling. read out loud as much as you can. very happy with it!"
duolingo,5,0,"i only got this a few days ago but so far it's been engaging, encouraging and overall pleasantly education. the lessons are simple and friendly even for absolute beginners for any language it offers. the daily reminders, subtle spirit of competition evoked from the leaderbaord and the goals and checkpoints all do a great job of helping me learn."
duolingo,5,0,very useful and fun. the word watching one with pictures could be a lot better without the pictures. i try hard to ignore the pictures so i can translate it without cheating but it is very hard since the pictures are so big.
duolingo,5,0,"i really love the variety of ways this pp reaches you a particular language. it's also those same ways that help them stick into your head!!! i would totally recommend this pp to everyone who is trying to get a head start in a language they are taking in class, or even just for the sake of learning a new language."
duolingo,5,0,loved it.. easy to learn and systematic approach to build fundamentals.
duolingo,5,1,"more into on the update, please! i learned 3 languages, thank you! i like how language learning is structures. if you remember some grammar from your own language, you can easily recognize it and also differences between languages that will speed up your learning. i miss a few features from almost 3 years ago, that made domingo friendliest."
duolingo,5,0,"amazing! i love it. the pp is great, and it thought me lots of organ! thanks."
duolingo,5,0,"fantastic pp, it has helped me expand and improve my foreign language skill so much!"
duolingo,5,0,enjoying this pp very much.the l questions are short and precise and if you make a mistake you get another try.
duolingo,5,0,"love this pp, so easy to start learning another language."
duolingo,5,0,"excellent pp,we can use anywhere daytime ,and learn the language."
duolingo,5,1,"outstanding. from basis to advanced, learn at whatever speed and intensity you like. comprehensive. great variety of methods and help. structures and bite-sized: reading, writing, watching and speaking lessons with hints & tips, how and why grammar pages, grade story reading, learner discussions, rewards and so much more. regular updated. plus feedback to responsive, innovative and knowledgeable language and technical developer. not so intrusion as. and free. what's not to like?"
duolingo,5,0,i have tried revising my french for many years now and i can confidently say that this is the best method l have come across. buds.
duolingo,5,0,"this is fantastic. starting from almost no knowledge, i am progressing well learning garlic with lessons lasting a few minutes each day; and it's fun. highly recommend"
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp! i'm reviewing my spanish i learned a long time ago! it's very helpful. i wish you would add tagalog (filipino) since i'm living in the philippines and would greatly appreciate it. i have to use long to learn tagalog. i'd love to be able to learn it in this pp since this pp is better and more fun to use! please add tagalog! i love the new stories! please add the filipino language also! 😊
duolingo,5,0,"been using free version for couple weeks. i have started with french as i once had 7 years instruction, though the last year for this was 38 years ago and i did not keep up usage of the language so have lost most of it; though apparently not as much as i thought as i'm doing very well. the reminders for lesson times are appreciated and not unobtrusive. i hope this can get me to conversational level sooner than book study."
duolingo,5,0,"the garlic course is very enjoyable. the structure is effective - challenging as well as motivation - and i'm surprised how much i'm retaining, in the short term at least. i didn't start as an absolute beginner, but the pp is consolidating the little garlic i had, and extending it considerably. definitely worth spending time on."
duolingo,5,0,"the internet has its good and bad, and at the very top of the best on offer are gems like domingo. i have been learning languages on and off efficiently for years, and domingo has taken me next level. simple, interactive and designed beautifully. thank you. i'd give 6 stars if possible. love your work."
duolingo,5,5,"pretty good for practicing a language you've already had a bit of experience in, but i don't think it's the best for learning languages that don't use standard letters found in english, french, etc., like japanese or organ. it simply doesn't go into enough details about the basis and just shoves it in your face, making new earners become discouraged from being overwhelmed. i suggest having some other beginner-friendly apes before trying to learn one of those languages on here."
duolingo,5,0,i do not know all language learning apes but from the ones that i know this is by far the best pp. i usually hate apes with as but i do understand their importance for you from a business perspective and their necessity. i hope it will always remain free. thank you for this amazing pp. amazing job worth 10 stars
duolingo,5,0,this pp is the best i do not have any problem with it the pp is free the as are not outrageous and i do recommend for everyone
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is a great, easy-to-use pp for language learning that makes it fun and engaging to do something that was very tedious in school. i'd be happy if apes like this replaced school altogether. it is very well-programme, it makes sure to continually motivate you, and rewards all types of learning style."
duolingo,5,0,love it! easy fun accessible way to learn a new language
duolingo,5,0,an amazing language learning aid! the improved competitive leagues really drive me to practice more with each session. this pp has really assisted me with my organ studies and it is completely free! someday soon i will join the paid version as it adds that final touch to really sharpen my skill.
duolingo,5,0,"from what i've used so far its excellent, repetition so that you can memories the words well. it takes time to learn and remember the language so i've learnt that you need to be patient with the pp as you won't learn it in 2 weeks but it could be months the more you use it."
duolingo,5,0,the best way to start learning a language i've ever tried (not there have been many) fun to pick up and easy to get started!
duolingo,5,0,"one of the best ways to learn a new language, give been using it for a few days and have already learned so much. mi gust!"
duolingo,5,0,it's amazing and interesting for my inner child. i love this pp and after it download i shared this cut pp to all my contact's list.
duolingo,5,1,"this is a great and fun way to learn a new language. i'm learning chinese and it's motivation and encouraging and the use of ilyin, characters and audit/spoken helps so much in linking tones,sounds, words, characters and meaning. it makes learning enjoyable again!"
duolingo,5,0,"its superb... i really love the pp. it's so interesting to learn more on each day, and i am so much satisfied with using the pp. it made me much more to learn a language. there are lots of different languages on it to teach us more about the languages and more. i am really interests and love the pp"
duolingo,5,0,awesome pp. the as can be a pain but i'd say its worth it. you're learning a language for free and at high quality. highly recommended! i'm learning my mother tongue since i lost most of it when i was a child. i'm so grateful for domingo. i'm remaining my heritage!
duolingo,5,0,"it's really fun and extremely intuition, i couldn't be more impressed with the way they've combined so many effective technique for learning into such a digestive and rewarding package, all the fine details are perfect."
duolingo,5,2,"the course is simple to follow and the forum allows for queried to be answered. i haven't used podcasts yet, but the stories help. my only area of regret with the system is the abuse of extra points. there are some who compound more points than time allows and this stops target being achieved. but, this course is still the best for learning a language and not just basic conversational ability. i have recommended domingo and there is now a group of six of us studying together."
duolingo,5,0,"it really is free! their are adds but they aren't annoying or forced, you can close them at any point. i'm learning a tremendous amount and spend more time on this pp than anticipated. this is my new favorite game."
duolingo,5,9,"as a language teacher it is my opinion that domingo perfectly grass the necessity to repeat important vocabulary while slowly adding new words each lesson (known as comprehensible input). lessons are engaging and varied while still allowing the learner to be successful. to me, the use of contextualized stories is brilliant and entertaining. i highly recommend this pp if you are interested in learning a new language. i hope that as i continue advancing, that they include more cultural content."
duolingo,5,0,"i'm just about pleased with the application and i'd suggest it to anyone else who'd want to learn a new language. i haven't come far enough to say much about its learning progresses but i believe with enough use of the application, you'll be able to at least master a few terms and even a few languages. it doesn't have any inappropriate as and works very nicely."
duolingo,5,0,awesome pp. great way to learn different languages for free.
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp. it is so easy to use and covers do many languages.
duolingo,5,0,one of the best apes for learning new languages. very simple and friendly to use.
duolingo,5,0,"amazing pp, amazing service, if i could afford to support the great work they do by buying plus i would!"
duolingo,5,0,"very good pp. i use it a lot! it really helps me, as i am very interested in learning other languages"
duolingo,5,0,i really enjoy this pp. and it makes learning easier than other methods i have tried!
duolingo,5,0,"this pp is really admitting! a really nice free pp to use without worrying to forceful spend some money, as the hearts are gained from practicing or from gems earned by leveling up. but i find it really hard to learn russian without knowing the translation of cyrillic alphabet. i hope on the next update there will be a feature that translated cyrillic into latin alphabet."
duolingo,5,0,"a very well paced, varied, and fun learning application that i believe is actually helping me learn languages very easily. this pp is probably my favourite language learning pp. the only downside is that i wish it had a feature to submit phrases for correction by native language speakers like other apes do."
duolingo,5,2,"wonderful.! i'm using it to keep my brain active whilst not working. i did not have the opportunity to learn any languages at school, and probably would never have studied a second language if it were not for do. i'm very much enjoying the opportunity to go at my own pace with incentive and encouragement from do. my turn to say, brilliant, well-done and a big thank-you! . ."
duolingo,5,2,"this is a great pp, and so far, i've been learning russian and progressing very well. the only improvement i could think of is to add the actual alphabet and what sounds each letter makes for that language. it would really help if that was added. otherwise an amazing pp!"
duolingo,5,1,"i've always wanted to learn a foreign language, but i thought it would be difficult. this pp teachers in such a way that keeps you interested. it doesn't start off teaching you the alphabet and verb tense, but reaches you how to speak similarly to how you would teach a child. and the authentic pronunciation buy authentic speakers enhanced the ability to learn"
duolingo,5,0,very useful pp and easy to learn new languages if you seriously give your time to learn from here daily. very impressive and also free of cost. you can learn from where you are. idle language learning pp for full time busy people because of its flexible learn time feature.
duolingo,5,0,great language learning pp! plus it's free and a fun way to learn.
duolingo,5,1,"absolutely amazing!!! i have learnt more japanese in the last week that i have over the past few years with books. its amazing and the competition aspect adds a little more fun too it along with rewards in the form of lights. i have family members on it now all learning different languages. couldn't recommend it more, exceptional pp."
duolingo,5,1,"i've only been using the pp for a week or so, but so far it's been a thoroughly enjoyable experience and i haven't seen any bags. i still don't know whether it will work for me in the long run, in terms of learning languages completely, but it has done far more in the way of motivation me to learn at least something new everyday, and that's more than i can ask for from a free pp. overall it's been a perfect experience: 5/5 stars."
duolingo,5,0,"this pp is amazing. if you are a beginner and don't know a language, domingo is the best pp for you. it will help you learn a language very efficiently. it is also very easy to use. i have been using it for a few months and am totally in love with it. one thing that i would like to say is that you should also make us do more oral practice. it will be very helpful. this pp is great for children and adults alike. the best part is that the pp is regularly updated. love it."
duolingo,5,0,"brilliant a great pp to learn and develop new languages, i travel a lot so am often between different countries and can stop from one language to another. this is great the pp is clear and corrects when some thing is not right, so you understand and learn as you go. i love it."
duolingo,5,0,really excellent way to refresh on or learn a language! highly recommend!
duolingo,5,1,"excellent pp. i've picked up more french in a couple of lessons than i ever thought 9 possiblethe tips before each lesson are very good and i'm actually enjoying learning a language. it's good to see, hear and speak the language all in one pp. highly recommend this way of learning"
duolingo,5,0,very good suitable for all levels and very smart in offering additional assistance in areas you need weather it be grammar or vocabulary. could not recommend enough. a family plan would be great though. it would cost over €50 per month for my whole family which is prohibitive.
duolingo,5,0,"i love the pp, but ever since the last update it's impossible for me to use it. the 'double your wager' message keeps appearing over and over and i can't access any exercise (or any other function of the pp). really hoping for a way to fix this."
duolingo,5,0,love love love this pp. returning back to a language it's given me a good starting point to return and pick it up
duolingo,5,0,"it's easy, fun and helpful. this pp helped me a lot. if you don't want to be a pro at a language, you can just learn the basis."
duolingo,5,1,"the best language pp i've ever used. child friendly and has fun and creative animated pictures in some questions. i am learning german and in just a few days i have already learned most the basis and can say a variety of sentences. i would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone whether it's for school, going to another country or even just for fun it's one of the best educational apes i've ever used. it also gives you daily modifications to tell not to break a strike. 😊😊😊👍"
duolingo,5,0,great pp. would love it more if you could hear the words more.
duolingo,5,1,"love how this pp gives you experience in hearing, translating, writing and speaking the language you are studying. the methods work very well for me. you are in some ways immersed in the language and yet there is also direction and support. i recommend it highly!"
duolingo,5,0,"if you plan on actually learning a language this pp is wonderful. take in mind when you were in first grade learning you had note cards and studied in class to ""learn"". if you have the same midst with this pp i feel the results will be wonderful.*there is a ""heart/error"" system in the pp. so if you loose all your 5 hearts for the time(they refill) that were you should study and learn were and why you missed up or forgot."
duolingo,5,1,"i love this pp!!! it lets you hear, read and speak the language in different formats so it never gets boring, get some friends in on it and start a competition along with the leaderboards already set up. basically skin roseola stone and go for something that is better and free😉"
duolingo,5,0,"5 stars so far, it's really helpful. although it gets firing trying learn things and it just repeats, but i have a bad memory so it's really good for me. different people have different ways of learning, but domingo takes it slow and easy for easy learning. thank you to the creator, you did good."
duolingo,5,0,"i find the pp incredibly useful for learning the basis of a language, although i wish they has a page or maybe a lesson where you could easily see different variations of profound, possession profound etc., but that's probably just because i'm a bit old-school when learning languages."
duolingo,5,0,"this pp is honestly so amazing. so many languages to choose from and the best part, you get to learn on your time. the lessons aren't hours long which makes it so much easier to learn and practice. i would recommend taking notes with each lesson so you can refer to them whenever you need them."
duolingo,5,0,"i love domingo. it's really practical and useful, the only problem is that the sound just goes off after one or two questions. i really hope it get fixed since i can not hear the pronunciation. please consider this bug in the updated😔"
duolingo,5,0,"the best and easiest way to practice your language learning. however, i don't think it's actually possible to learn a new language just by using this pp. you will have look up some of the rules yourself, plus the france between the meaning of the words. other than that, i think practically everyone should have this pp"
duolingo,5,0,"pretty good, i stopped using it after a while and came back after a few years, i thought it wasn't taking effect but when i reviewed what i had previously done i was surprised to see i actually learned the content. give it a shot you might surprise yourselves!"
duolingo,5,0,it's amazing and really helpful it really reaches you and in a very short time wood! all of our family have it learning different languages
duolingo,5,0,i love how the native speakers talk slowly & enunciated words clearly so you can mimi the sounds!
duolingo,5,0,"dating my already 5 star review. yes free users have a heart system. i personally find the failure, rise and repeat method actually helps me learn better. any negative review about it makes little sense. you can take tests to regain hearts. if you get something wrong additional learning only makes sense. the only ""shady"" practice is when free users get as, the ignore button random is at the bottom or the top left of the screen. which only switches location every 24 hours."
duolingo,5,2,"i really appreciate the hard work that goes into making do happen.being able to just pick a language and start learning it is f'n awesome! it is challenging thought everyone can retain what they've learned as easy as others can.i personally don't mind that,but some other folks,in the comments, seem very frustrated and blame do for their mistakes.i recently took a progress quit.i was so happy,because i thought i acid it! but now i'm not too sure, since my daily lessons seem much easier :)♡do"
duolingo,5,0,"i have been using this pp for months and although i was doubting it for awhile, it is all coming together. i even had to take a break for some time but when i started back up it was easy to recall. i haven't used any other apes to compare but domingo does work....."
duolingo,5,0,fantastic. i have used some programs before and took a few smelters of various languages in college and i am definitely impressed. it really helps cement the language and you can spend either a few minutes or a few hours with it.
duolingo,5,0,"would highly recommend giving the free version a go and then if you like it, upgrade to the pro version. i'm an officer in the merchant navy, so the office mode comes in very handy for long voyages. worth the money!"
duolingo,5,0,using it for german. and its been working even if you dont put clot if effort into it.
duolingo,5,0,"so.. i for some reason had this made up belief that domingo was a me pp, never having used it. i was happy to discover i was wrong. while looking for language lessons, domingo kept coming up and i felt like at this point i had to at least give it a try. i've used it on my daily commune for a week now, and not only does the time fly, feeling i get to where i'm going faster, but the learning is actually.. fun? i find myself going ""i can squeeze in one more lesson"" all the time. it's great."
duolingo,5,0,1. i like the content. it's very concise and information. 2. relentless repetition of the same words make remembering how to write and pronounce words and phrases very easy. 3. making possible to use pp all day long if needed for free is also appreciated.
duolingo,5,1,"i finished spanish and am currently doing french on domingo and the results have been great! i really recommend this pp if you want to improve your language skill. when you first open the pp, it asks if you are a beginner or already know some of it. if you are just starting, you start from scratch. if you are a little more on the intermediate side, you take a placement test to see where you are, and you can get a headstart and you can go from there."
duolingo,5,0,"best free pp for learning german, lots of content and the forum help is superb. one request would be to show the gender of nous when clinking word hint. also worth mentioning is that do offers many free stories with comprehension testing. all the stories i have read so far have been enjoyable. they are a great way to consolidate learning. my thanks to the do team. have an extra sixth star do, for the fun stories."
duolingo,5,0,best way to learn a new language. use it for a few months before i go to a new country and am usually conversational before i get there.
duolingo,5,0,this pp has been a great way to improve my french. the leagues keep me competitive.
duolingo,5,5,"hands down the best pp ever for learning a language without a lot of time or money. i have learned a lot of german, spanish and even a bit of russian the last 6 months just by doing domingo on my 15 min commune on the bus each morning. it is fun, not too easy and not too hard. just last week, a man on to started speaking german and although he spoke too fast for me to fully understand i was able to identify a few words and the general meaning of what he said. super exciting!!"
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp. its interactive and the pace is great. as long as you show up every day you're bound to learn your language(s) of choice. i've taken in a few languages with different characters and phonetics and i fair well with the program lay out.
duolingo,5,0,"i have tried other language programs and for me, domingo is a cut above the others. domingo reaches the flow of the language instead of phrases to memories, and piece the language together for yourself. they provide a comment and question section where questions you have are answered by knowledgeable and sometimes native language speakers. i strongly encourage those seeking to learn new languages to try domingo. free or paid, it is well worth the time."
duolingo,5,0,very enjoyable and fun brain training and you learn a new language! very well laid out pp
duolingo,5,7,"i have learned so much in such a short time! great pp! do provides the ability to learn in many ways.. by hearing in the target language and translating to native language, by reading it in native language and translating into written form of the target language, by testing your hearing of the target language and having you write or speak what you heard in that language... plus the forms are spectacular and have helped me to the moon and back when certain structures of french have puzzled me."
duolingo,5,0,"great pp for learning a great variety of languages. it makes learning languages fun like playing a game. as someone who is client in english and portuguese, and quite proficient in spanish and japanese, i would highly recommend this pp for serving its purpose. thanks domingo, brigade!"
duolingo,5,0,"i stopped using the pp due to repetition in the assignment. since then, some incredibly interesting upgrade were made that are not only unique but fun. the stories are very useful to me as i get to read, repeat and translate words that are not familiar to me and end in laughter or surprise. good job, domingo."
duolingo,5,1,"the pp has been very useful for me in the past few months. really good interface, nice & fancy graphics, & it gives you a really joyful sensation, while making a good use of the pp itself. continue making improvements, & as always, keep up the good work. 🔝💞"
duolingo,5,1,i love this pp and everything it has to offer. my only request is that there is a vocabulary bank of all the words you've learned so far for a quick reference in case you're not able to at the time immediately write down the vocabulary for flashcards or other forms of studying.
duolingo,5,0,"this is a wonderful pp to learn secondary languages. it's interface makes it so easy, smooth and the concept of streaks makes you want to open the pp everyday and learn for at least 5 minutes. it's very useful and if you're looking to learn languages, this is the pp to download."
duolingo,5,0,"in my opinion, this is a great pp, and there reasons why: 1.it explains you in degrees about previously base of language while other apes explains like: translate ""chiaroscurist"" now 2.its free and let's lot of financially disabled people learn new language and become more open minded! but! i would like if you added dictionary! like.. in lingual! by the way, biggest thank you! you did the greatest job that helps people change their life! guess enough"
duolingo,5,0,i appreciate the ability to fully educate myself for free. sitting through the as is actually worth what i'm getting. also the sentences seem weird and random but they actually help you to pick up more words at one time and learn to construct sentences properly.
duolingo,5,0,"thanks domingo,i love it but i can't listen to the sound.the sound isn't work correctly.thanks a lot."
duolingo,5,0,lots of repetition and reinforcement--just what the doctor ordered!
duolingo,5,0,only used this pp for a few days. it is very easy to use and has a good pace and repetition for learning.
duolingo,5,0,"brilliant pp, so easy to use and very effective for learning."
duolingo,5,0,"very helpful, easy and fun way to learn many languages"
duolingo,5,0,absolutely love this pp. it kind feels like learning a language is a game.
duolingo,5,0,worth every penny. fashioned like a game. amazing how fast i have picked up basic conversational spanish
duolingo,5,0,easy to learn and to stay on track! never found learning a language easier than this!
duolingo,5,0,easy to use. i like the layout. so far it has helped me learn spanish.
duolingo,5,0,"i once thought that domingo was a leading pp in learning and support both, yet recently the opposite has shown up. i have a problem in pronunciation sound but there was no way i could specifically claim my problem please deal with it at once many are suffering this problem"
duolingo,5,2,"this is a great pp, but why did you reduce the number of lessons for each skill? i prefer it the way it was myself, it seems too streamlined now. i think most people need the extra practice to fully digest the material from each lesson before moving on."
duolingo,5,3,"i love this pp! i love how they have it organized, and the addition of stories that gives you context for all of the vocabulary and grammar that you're using. you also have an opportunity to learn new vocal within the context of the stories. i also enjoy the encouragement to compete and study and the opportunity to have conversations with other domingo users in your language that you choose to study."
duolingo,5,0,this pp is incredibly helpful for beginners like me. when you don't know how to start learning some language just download this pp. the only thing i would change in domingo is background colour. i use dark mode in everywhere. it's a shame that this pp doesn't support it.
duolingo,5,1,"i use it to learn german basis, especially reading and writing. i'm very satisfied as my goal to write repeatedly simple things until them all are in my unconscious. my feeling that it can give in writing solid a and some things in by. i use other methods for speaking and listening."
duolingo,5,0,"domingo, is the best pp yet. it's easy to use, and it outstanding for languages. it takes you step through step through what you want to learn, and has extra things like stories and a special shop to buy things like streak freeze and more. i recommend this highly for anyone who wants to learn a language free of charge."
duolingo,5,1,"i've been using this pp for about 4 years and it is my favourite pp ever in the entire world. but i feel like there are so many languages that you can start from and translate into english and from english into them, but eventhough you can take a course on english to hebrew you can't take a course on hebrew to any other language which i find disappointing as that would be my favourite course because i've already finished the english to hebrew one. please get hebrew as a starting language x"
duolingo,5,0,"i have been on here for 5 days and it is fun, entertaining, and education. you learn many new words in the language you choose. i recommend for all ages if you are bored and want to do something fun and entertaining!!!"
duolingo,5,0,"this is one of the best free apes. for someone who has learned languages before, this pp is great for me. i am using it to clean up my spanish and learn french. it will help you learn all of the grammar that you need to move into advanced. however, you have to take it upon your self to broaden your vocabulary. languages have too many words to just relay on one program for vocabulary."
duolingo,5,0,the pp is great. the way of learning is easy and straight forward.
duolingo,5,0,"domingo is a great pp to start learning languages. it is continuously being improved and updated. when you complete a course ""tree"" your reward is a golden owl for your achievement. the only negative is as a result of updated to the tree they keep taking away your owl which can take months to earn back after completing the new material. it's all worth it in the end though as it means you learn more."
duolingo,5,3,"it's the best pp! i am not a native english speaker, but while learning other languages on domingo i practise my english too! it's super fun and easy. currently i am learning esperanto and improving my germany and organ that i used to learn kind a long time ago. please add finnish, i like that language a lot and i want to learn it through domingo. it's really nice that i can learn multiple languages with only one account on one pp. also the style is cut and positive. really awesome 💚"
duolingo,5,0,this pp is great. it keeps reminding you to use it and learn every day. highly recommend!
duolingo,5,1,"a really great pp to help learn a language or two. the repetition on phrases in exercises is really helpful to retain the information, rather than just learning a new word or phrase and moving on. the up and leaderboard makes the challenge more fun as well."
duolingo,5,0,"at my pace, gets progressively more difficult. love the pp. i like that there are challenges,, but i wish there were a built-in day off. i get burned out sometimes. still having fun and learning to be lingual. already trying to decide which language to learn next."
duolingo,5,5,"i've been using this pp for a while now, and i wanted to finally deliver my review to potentially help out someone who may be interested in downloading this pp. i like the short stories in the book. i feel like it helps you to become more client by learning via conversation compared to only learning a few phrases at a time. i enjoy the challenges and lessons you learn while studying. it would be nice if the pp had the ability to connect those who speak the language to learn more directly."
duolingo,5,0,"i do like this pp, i can see a clear learning path . love all the points i'm racking up. yes silly but motivate me to come back . however not sure why i'm stuck with limited vocabulary of mamma papa media motor tim tom in the russian version . foi i'm still at the beginners level . i'm sure the academic on the team know best."
duolingo,5,0,it makes starting to learn a language easier than other methods i've tried.
duolingo,5,0,"it's free and helped me learn to speak portuguese. it won't make you client in any language but, considering that it's free, it helps a lot."
duolingo,5,0,"learning a new language requires reading materials, conversational practice, as well as memorizing words, phrases, etc. this pp is definitely a must have for every language earners. domingo helps me learn and practice new words, phrases, etc. everyday."
duolingo,5,0,it's a very helpful supplement to other methods of learning a language.
duolingo,5,0,"really enjoying using this pp to learn new languages. currently using the free service, with the odd month premium here and there to give some support. unfortunately i wouldn't be able to afford a whole year even though i think it's a wonderful resource that i hope continues to encourage people to learn."
duolingo,5,73,i love this pp! learning is made fun with motivation messages and easy with daily reminders and progressive lessons. my only thing is i wish i could review words i've learned so far on the pp so i can make my own flash cards or put sticky notes everywhere 😂 . literally after posting this review i found tiny cards by domingo which is the flash cards i wanted. now i have two epic apes to help me learn another language!
duolingo,5,0,"this pp is the best for learning a language for free. the mobile version has a limit of five hearts if you dont get premium, but if you have a computer i found that there is no hearts taken away if you make a mistake. over all i think this is the best pp for you and your friends or family to learn a language."
duolingo,5,0,wonderful pp! you can squeeze it in any where at any time. its also structures in a way that drills you over and over on the phrases you don't get right until you're sure to remember it. i feel it's been a better learning program than a classroom!
duolingo,5,0,"i love how this pp is structures. learning new language is never easy without practice and constant work, but this pp really helps me a lot and makes the process fun and easy. my husband is a native speaker of spanish and i am learning spanish with domingo, and he says i am doing a great job!"
duolingo,5,0,100 % recommend for new earners. structurally programme courses and it makes you learn all the basis of a language just by taking 15 minutes in your daily routine. i am highly satisfied using this application and have suggested to my near and years.
duolingo,5,0,i took french in high school and have always wanted to find an easy way to brush up on it... do is the perfect tool for this. the best feature in the pp are the stories... they give good context to the things you're learning.
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp! in working on garlic right now and just 10-15 min a day vs social media? yaaaas! i like the reminder feature and how you gain points for working. definitely should use headphones so you can get the infections right.
duolingo,5,0,"this is the best pp! now i learned how to speak spanish! i learned how to speak spanish in only 1 week! you should download it right now! you can actually change the languages everytime you want! i enjoyed this pp so much! i'm glad that i download this pp! now i can understand and speak spanish,organ,and japanese! i gave 5 stars because i hope this pp will be famous!"
duolingo,5,0,great application to help with language learning and practice.
duolingo,5,0,absolutely love using this pp for learning spanish. i've tried so many over the years - domingo is the only one that actually works for me.
duolingo,5,0,this has been great! i love being able to learn when it fits in my schedule.
duolingo,5,0,"i'm using domingo to learn spanish. the lessons are short and easy, and i'm surprised by how many words and phrases i've already learned in the short time i've been using this pp. it's actually kind of fun! awesome free educational pp, highly recommend it."
duolingo,5,0,i really love this pp so much. i got to learn another language but when i tried to learn english (to fix my pronunciation) there's no option for balaga delay when you asked me to choose what language i'm using. so i hope there will be more improvement soon.
duolingo,5,1,"using domingo to learn swedish. it is a great tool for practicing and intuitively learning vocabulary / grammar. i recommend picking up some formal materials to solidity the ""why"" of certain things i.e. ""hon had pp fig en so"" vs ""hon had en so pp fig"" or min/mist/mind. however, the pp does present these items in a manner where you learn them intuitively -- you just might need another source to understand academically why and what is going on grammatical."
duolingo,5,0,"its not going to make you a master of any language, but its a quick headstart and a great practice tool."
duolingo,5,0,"some times i can't hear any things, i updated it, but it doesn't work"
duolingo,5,0,"this pp helps me learn a language that i can only describe as addictively fun. i took two years of spanish in high school, but in one week i felt as if i was remembering everything i learned back then and learning tons more. great pp design to a degree that makes starting a new language no challenge at all."
duolingo,5,2,"domingo is awesome! makes learning a language very engaging and fun. many examples of writing, speaking, hearing, visual, networking with others and all with daily reminders so your stay on track with your lessons. love the new story conversation lessons. puts all the learning to a true test. keep it up!!!"
duolingo,5,0,"very enjoyable, makes it very easy to learn another language."
duolingo,5,2,"after last update i've noticed that it simply doesn't count a passed level - i have to repeat same exercises again. it happens almost every second time. that is definitely a bug or a pitch - i have perfect internet connection and no other problems, so i have to leave one star here until the developer fix this annoying bug."
duolingo,5,0,easy to use immediately and doesn't take much time out of your day really enjoying it so far.
duolingo,5,0,great fun and an easy way to learn a language. it's really effective.
duolingo,5,0,awesome experience so far! helping to refresh my memory as i spire to become client in a second language.
duolingo,5,0,it is a great pp it helps you learn other languages especially if you are already studying it #wonderful pp #great learning complex 😊😊
duolingo,5,0,"great pp. would recommend. one slight issue that i would like assistance with more than anything. so basically, i started a language course that i no longer wish to do and the ""learning language"" option/area cannot be found. what do i do? i use an andros phone if that helps."
duolingo,5,1,"i love this pp! i've been playing for 2 days now, and i've learned so much spanish! this is the only language teaching pp, that is actually fun and educational! i also love how there are hardly any as at all too! 😃i will definitely continue to use this pp, thank you for the pp! 😃"
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp it had me hooked straight away . the positive encouragement is really rather adjective and gives you a boost while learning . it is so easy to use and makes the target time i set for myself go so quickly that i always do double the amount. brilliant
duolingo,5,0,"really good pp. chosen language (scottish garlic) is broken down into smaller topics. learning by repetition, verbal and written. the pp is good is encouraging you along, even when you make mistakes."
duolingo,5,0,it's pretty awesome to be able to learn a new language at your own pace. my only complaint is about the leaderboard and how people use their native language to boost to the top. unsportsmanlike. but what i would like to happen and what actually happens are two different things.
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp so much! the only thing i wish it had was a way to practice pronouncing words or take vocabulary quires separately from the different levels! either way, i am going to continue using it because it is my absolute favorite pp right now!"
duolingo,5,0,it's actually free and and if you invite friends to the pp you get a week of domingo free! i haven't gotten us yet but i am seriously considering it although it is great if you don't have plus to. if you are trying to learn a new language and are serious then go on domingo also has great goals you can set for yourself with a wide variety of lessons.
duolingo,5,0,"i my opinion the free version is better than the paid one. when you run out of lives - meaning you did mistakes, because you don't remember the words correctly - the pp makes you reach what you learnt in past lessons in order to gain a life to continue with your further progress."
duolingo,5,3,"i'm studying latin and scots gàidhlig on domingo. i adore this pp. fun, easy to navigable, and very interesting. in gàidhlig, i especially like the range of voices used. this offers a reflection of different accents. i also enjoy the competitive edge of the pp. i think, ooh, if i work hard i'll get into the top 10 of this week's league!"
duolingo,5,0,"hey domingo, i'm writing to make a suggestion & i hope that you'll read it. 3 things i'd like to see available in lessons. 1.) i'd like to see an update where the lessons notes are opened when you very first start a section (as i often forget them), also please have translations/pronunciation of words when referring to them in the notes in their native language. 2.)i'd like to see some culture thrown in to learn about. 3.)additional materials like literature or video, that will be optional."
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp! i have been using domingo for at least 1 year and i find it easy to navigable. user-friendly and easy to learn a language. i absolutely love the new domingo stories. it makes learning & practicing more enjoyable and interesting. thank you!
duolingo,5,0,"it's a great pp to start learning languages off of. i use it all the time. my favorite part of this pp is if you miss a day, if you bought a power-up it will not cost you anything (i also love this pp because it's free download and has free learning)"
duolingo,5,0,"my new favorite pp. whether you're truly serious about learning a new language or want to just learn enough to localise your self in a country of foreign language for travel i recommend this pp. the game aspect to it all makes you want to succeed even more. 5 stars, i never rate 5 out of 5"
duolingo,5,1,"i love love this pp, it's fun and easy to use. the only thing i would change about it is the practice quires, they don't go over things you've already learned. it puts things in there you haven't but i guess it's another way of learning it on the fly. thanks for such a great learning tool"
duolingo,5,3,"i decided to learn a new language and this pp is helping in an incredible way. is easy to use, extremely handy and the plus version allows you to study even office. perfect for me, since i work in a place with no internet connection. during my break i can keep study a bit more, working on my skill. definitely recommended!"
duolingo,5,0,"i love it. makes learning fun and gives reminders to practice. even with a crazy schedule even if i can only use 5 minutes to practice, there's always new words to learn. a good learning supplement."
duolingo,5,0,"very good introduction. learning polish is difficult. it would be helped it there was some duties guide chart to what letters form certain pronunciation, declarations and plural as it leaves you to guess at these. overall very well done though and i feel i'm going to learn to speak 10 languages through this."
duolingo,5,0,"just a great pp for learning a language. really well set up, easy to navigable, good lessons and keeps you motivate to learn. i'm learning japanese and domingo has been a huge part in my progress."
duolingo,5,0,"great pp, if you use it regularly you will eminently learn a language, but it's best if you have real experience as well. absolutely amazing, i've never had any problems with it. 10/10 and 100% recommended!"
duolingo,5,0,the pp is what it say it is. but we can easily get out of the speaking and listening exercises. i ve only started so i hope i catch on the speaking part. but in definitely beginning to understand the language.
duolingo,5,0,this pp is amazing! only thing is that i missed my streak once and my parrot went missing:(
duolingo,5,0,"i'm dumbfounded - i tried to learn russian in the early was when i was traveling there for business. it's tough and it has a different alphabet. as i said, i'm dumbfounded at how quick i'm getting it. five days and i've learned more than 18 months working on a project there. absolutely crazy good program. it can be used free with as, but i'm going to pay the $5 a month because as do irritate me, but they deserve to make a little money on this program. i'm happy to pay it. k.doran"
duolingo,5,0,fun and easy to remember . well set up. other than pain avert

duolingo,5,0,"it is a great way to introduce yourself to a foreign language. the pp is fun, and the experience is like playing a game, but you still are learning a basic vocabulary, and the grammar will take you further than basic."
duolingo,5,0,"i'm loving this pp! i need to know spanish for day-to-day things, and i love the wide area of learning (reading, speaking, writing, and listening). it really is an all around experience, and i am definitely learning a lot and remembering a ton of spanish from school that i'd forgotten. definitely recommend this pp for people who are trying to learn or remember a language! the plus version is a little prices, but definitely worth it!"

duolingo,5,0,"been learning japanese, i'm happy to see it starts you off with hiragana and karagina and anti, instead of teaching the roman idea, in real world japan the language doesn't follow roman so domingo avoiding it and teaching the correct grammar and japanese alphabet is great. haven't tried another language but with that attention to detail i bet other languages are taught with authenticity"
duolingo,5,0,i think this is one of the best ways to learn a language!! its practical and easy to use. i love it!
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp! i've been using it for over 2 years, and they keep adding lessons and new details that keep it fresh and fun! my confidence with spanish and french has grown tremendous and i love trying out other languages periodically. it's great!"
duolingo,5,2,"it's great pp, easy to use, plenty of stuff to help u out with new language.. but i'd love to have 10 life instead of 5.. it would keep us engaged to pp longer. and it would be even greater gesture to us (who cannot afford to get premium). even though, we are thankful for this pp. keep it up!"
duolingo,5,0,"i find domingo to be a fun and simple way to learn. i have learned quickly and easily although it is difficult to become client with just an pp, domingo is great for getting you to that place where you can go to a real class and really perfect your skill."

duolingo,5,4,"was looking for a good way to learn scottish garlic, couldn't find it anywhere. i've used domingo in the past for other languages and it's been a good service, but the addition of scottish garlic in domingo's effective ways has really put the cherry on the cake for me. the hard work of everyone involved in this program and this course specifically has been of fantastic value to me."

duolingo,5,1,"easy and enjoyable to use. simple interface. if you're a beginner, it isn't intimidating in the least. if there's a language you're already familiar with but haven't perfectly, domingo offers tests that allows you to skin courses."
duolingo,5,0,"this pp is mildly admitting! i absolutely love it and i'm very happy with my results so far. i am going on holiday to spain later this year so i thought i would learn some spanish to help me on my trip as it's not all inclusive. even my 7 year old brother is becoming addicted to it saying ""i anna learn more spanish!"" whether that just because he knows i'll let him stay up for longer that way i'll let you decide ll. after only a couple of lessons of us using the pp, we are doing very well!!!"
duolingo,5,0,great pp and each new version add more fun ways to learn languages

duolingo,5,0,"i love the arabic learning. it stretches you and challenges, but if you keep it up every day, it's definitely double."
duolingo,5,0,"bite sized lessons and lots of repetition make learning painless. if you want an intense learning experience then this isn't for you, but if you pop on every day you'll definitely learn. lots of leaderboard challenges and judges."
duolingo,5,0,"it's generally very good, but the teacher's pronunciation can be improved. for instance, in chinese, i wish they'd consistently follow the being standard of pronunciation. sometimes i seem to hear a southern chinese dialect accent."
duolingo,5,3,it's very useful and very easy to use it ... but there is problem in the exercise that request speaking especially when the earners be an arabic native language and they learn english as a second language in general .. the pp is very useful and it affects on my life for better i recommend it for any person who have passion to learn another language without any cost mentioned and i it will affects many sides in your life best regards 😍😍
duolingo,5,0,good application but unfortunately there are differences between english-to-german and turkish-to-german.
duolingo,5,0,i simply love using the pp to learn a new language. it's had been wonderful and i look forward to improving myself to speak my new chosen language better.
duolingo,5,0,simply well done. the free version is also very very good.
duolingo,5,1,"i'm learning hind through domingo and i must say that it has surpassed my expectations. even if the method is based on grammar and translation, it helps a lot to practice and, if you pay attention to detail, to learn new things and correct mistakes you were doing."
duolingo,5,0,"great pp, even with apes and some limits you still can learn every day with fun"
duolingo,5,1,"at first i was worried that i couldn't go back and red lessons. but after falling into a steady rhythm with practise sessions, i find the quantity of class to practise perfect to internalized the content. i absolutely love this."
duolingo,5,1,great pp! makes learning a language fairly easy and fun. the up competition is a fun incentive to push people to come back everyday and practice for longer periods of time. plus if you have any issues the developer is pretty quick to respond and super helpful ☺️
duolingo,5,0,"i've tried a lot of learning apes with similar purpose but this is by far the best. easy to use and very very useful , information and it has beautiful i.  right now i'm using the free version but i'm sure the pro version is definitely better and worth."
duolingo,5,0,"best free way to learn a language i have found so far. two improvements i could think of are randomization of the lessons, both in the courses and in practice, and more things to be able to spend my lights on. other than that, great pp!"
duolingo,5,1,"i wish there was less tying in english and more tying in the language i'm learning. i already speak english, don't need the practice, ll. great pp still. you learn through doing word puzzled, so its great both as a fun light practice or as an exercise alongside serious study."
duolingo,5,1,so many languages are made accessible through intuition learning technique. a language you have never remote experienced becomes easily available and while still difficult far less intimidating to tackle. great for anyone at virtually any language skill level as you can skin ahead and also can take it slow. there are so many lessons you can custonize your learning experience. i have been using the paid version which i feel improved my experience and was worth it after a year of unpaid use.
duolingo,5,0,this application is really unique i haven't seen another things like this free and very complete pack thanks for it
duolingo,5,0,i love the pp but sometimes the voice effects doesn't work.... please fix it

duolingo,5,0,"i find it easy to learn new languages using the pp. it helps build confidence in speaking and makes sure you get your pronunciation right. as an expect it helped me to be ready before i arrived in country, and saved expensive language lesson fees."
duolingo,5,0,really nice pp to learn language... but am getting malfunctions sometimes though. the speaker stops working always suddenly in middle of lesson it stops working in the since like i get no voice or anything which leads quit the lesson in middle to red it again.

duolingo,5,0,"i really like this pp. there is different angles of learning the language , so it doesn't get boring. i especially enjoy the stories and i really enjoy the little owl. it's fun. the only thing i find redundant is, that i have to write things in my own language."
duolingo,5,0,"does exactly what it says. reaches you a language so long as you're willing to learn. it's free, with an ad at the end of every lesson. the as are never a surprise, a trap or timed. at least in my experience."
duolingo,5,0,learning so fast! i got the pro version about an hour after trying it out. now my husband and i are practicing together and i am seriously blown away with how quickly i am picking up and retaining the material.
duolingo,5,1,"domingo works, it really works! i have to tell you that i'm learning and having fun while doing it. while, also i'm picking up many new interesting things like how to read and write in the selected language, new vocabulary building and the proper forms of pronunciation."
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp. works well. a very convenient way to learn a language.
duolingo,5,0,the one thing i would add would be drills for article gender.
duolingo,5,0,"the pp's great! but i guess it was going kind fast in some of my lessons so i couldn't catch up. also, sometimes the pronunciation aren't at all clear. the pp's also very handy, gives you reminders and all. :-)"
duolingo,5,0,100% left. i've never reviewed an pp before but i've never had one worth reviewing. this one is amazing. absolutely free and doesn't limit your use. i only wish the stories that are on their online format could be added to the pp.
duolingo,5,0,"this pp is just awesome, all i could say is just fantastic. i just felt in love with it. it is adjective and i always delete adjective apes but to this i had to say no to delete option. moreover it enhanced us by showing the ranks and i always stood at first. thank you sooooo much gracious😘😘😘😘."
duolingo,5,0,"the japanese course is a bit weak, but the spanish course is amazing! i'm able to understand more and more, and it's simple to spend 5 minutes a day learning it. keep in mind this is the spain dialect of spanish! it's much more formal than mexican spanish, and some words are slightly different. (ex.: bolígrafo in spain, but according to my mexican girlfriend, plump in mexico, coming from feather quill.)"
duolingo,5,0,"i enjoy the variety of languages... i wish some of the words were more functional, organ has me practicing tons of macdonald's, samson, hyundai...i feel like i'm watching an endless loop of commercial... but overall, i appreciate the program, wish as was an option."
duolingo,5,0,"soon good. it is honestly the best thing i have ever gotten. i don't have it plus because you don't need it.,.. it is amazing without the do plus thing and has helped me a lot with my spanish and chinese!!!😍😋there are apes but that doesn't matter, as they don't affect your learning!"

duolingo,5,0,i've always struggled with language learning but somehow domingo has figured out how to make it easy and fun. it feels more like a word puzzle game than anything else. and despite what the internet says he won't kill you for missing a day you just use up your streak freeze.
duolingo,5,0,i love to use domingo to learn italian.it help to improve my italy language and its actually not boring. on the other hand it always give remind for daily lesson that is really help to continue my learning without shipping my lesson. there are some adds. but its not big deal. anyway this pp is great.

duolingo,5,0,"it works and it's liable! :) i was learning spanish from scratch before trismus and it was really useful, now i do italian, for a beginner it's perfect, about avert they could appear in a language you study to make them part of the course not st to close as quick as possible to go on ;)"
duolingo,5,0,"i absolutely love it it reaches you baby step by baby step and you can do so many different languages! you type them to learn how to spell them, a speaker to say the word and learn how to say them, and you get to type them (translate)! if your reading this, you need this for you lungs! i'm doing spanish but there is so many more than just spanish! you learn them slowly! the slowly come in your head! it's such i great pp! you need this pp for different languages! so many things you have to see"

duolingo,5,0,i love using this pp on my phone or the webster on my computers. my only complaint is that sometimes the sound example is mumbled and impossible to determine but i just make sure to remember the correct pronunciation for that hiragana. my only complaint doesn't change my 5 star review.
duolingo,5,0,"really good. very interactive, one feels like one is making progress and surprisingly it seems to work! love the competitive aspect: it forces one to just do one quick exercise to ensure that every day gets a tick. so easy to let things lapse without some form of motivation."
duolingo,5,0,"i love this pp so much! i've come so far in learning both spanish and japanese! i have already recommended this pp to new comes from mexico to learn english. i wouldn't go to this pp to necessarily learn everything, but along with basic study of the language desired you will for sure have improvements in fleecy."
duolingo,5,0,"i have only been using domingo for 2 weeks, but already i feel like i am learning quickly. it doesn't feel like i'm just memorizing words. when the pp asks a question, i feel like my answers are more ""knowing"" rather than ""guessing"". plus i am learning to read, speak, and write the language all at once without feeling overloaded. i fully recommend domingo"
duolingo,5,0,"i just started using the pp 3 days ago and give have learned and retained quite a bit in the 15 mind or so a day.. it can be difficult at times to hear what they are saying, but the challenge is helping me retain the into."

duolingo,5,0,"hello, great pp, very interactive. however, i'm currently learning spanish and learning languages really isn't my specially. i've been searching for things i can listen to when i can sleep to improve my spanish. are there any additional resources like this that can help me? as i think listening to spanish while i sleep should help me passively"
duolingo,5,0,"i might leave do for a month or two, but i always come back because the pp domingo offers the most comprehensive language learning in a single pp. most apes are too expensive and require separate download per language, but not domingo. domingo has all of its languages embedded into one pp so you can easily twitch between languages and not lose your progress! also, each language is fully developed and it represents a full world experience e.g. not all european languages."
duolingo,5,0,it's an amazing fun way to learn a language. it's entertaining and you never get bored. the pp introduces new words to you at the right time so it's easy to remember them. i started learning spanish a few months ago and at this current day can say many sentences bluntly!

duolingo,5,0,a fantastic learning pp that makes me realize how outdated the current academic way of teaching languages is.
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp! its easy and does exactly what was promised!
duolingo,5,0,fantastic!!!!! it is so easy and accurate to use.
duolingo,5,0,i love this pp. especially the speaking as i get to apply the knowledge i learn.

duolingo,5,1,"the sample sentences are often quite entertaining. i like that only a single lesson counts now to maintain a multi day streak of continuous use. the spanish language ""story"" lessons are great; i hope they will be available for chinese soon."

duolingo,5,1,i enjoy learning using domingo. i also think that it could be very helpful if we could access to a bank of vocabulary with all the new words we have been learning so we can review them from time to time.

duolingo,5,1,"domingo has been a great experience. it's engaging in many ways, providing clever incentive to motivate your language learning experience. from streaks to leaderboards and reminder messages, i know i never would have committed quite as diligently if not for this pp. 10/10 would recommend."

duolingo,5,0,"it is a great pp to learn a new language and revise or refresh your memory of a language. however, it would be useful to have a keyboard with accents/characters to put on top of letters or words."

duolingo,5,2,its super easy to use so far (learning french). learning irish was a little rougher. i wouldn't mind starting off with a brief explanation of the terms and pronunciation first before diving into the lessons though.
duolingo,5,0,"it's great. easy to use, makes learning seem less like you're learning, although i'm not a fan on the competition part of it. i didn't update the pp because i've heard it makes it a lot harder to learn with the heart system"

duolingo,5,0,"domingo is great. i have learned so much in a few days. their teaching technique are solid. i am a teacher and they use something called ""spiral review."" they also make you access and present your knowledge in several different ways. i will recommend this pp to anyone who even vaguely wants to learn a language."

duolingo,5,0,this pp is perfect for learning many languages without going to classes
duolingo,5,0,let's just say i have learnt more spanish in 1 week than i did in 2 years of high school. i love that this pp starts with baby steps than progresses when you are ready to. i also love the practise for life feature. this pp pick up your strength and weaknesses and helps you improve through this feature instead brushing you off with a one off lesson like many other learning programs do. this pp makes learning fun by making it more of an pp game that you have to progress on to complete.

duolingo,5,0,awesome language learning pp. it continues to grow every year too. i continue to be impressed by it.
duolingo,5,0,"diverse learning tools handy for on -the-go, hectic lifestyle learning."
duolingo,5,0,i'm using it to learn japanese and i'm really enjoying it. lots of fun and i feel like it's really helping me learn a new language. i'm on day 77 now and i'm still enjoying it.
rosettastone,5,1,"fun and educational. i've wanted to learn something challenging. i decided to go with hebrew. it is an interesting language, especially it's based all on characters, unlike the english language. getting the accent down is another story, because i'm form the south and have an accent already, makes it more interesting. shall..."
rosettastone,5,3,i love this pp but starting to have problems with passing unit 1 milestones. every time i try and load the page i get booted straight to the results page where i am told that i didn't achieve the pass mark. if by some chance i manage to get to open the limestone section i get booted to the end results page and again am told that i didn't pass without being given the opportunity to complete the section. very frustration.
rosettastone,5,24,this is a great pp. although i just started learning german it has been great so far. i would highly recommend to anyone who is wanting to learn another language. i tried domingo and i had hearts i had to use and you run out very quickly.
rosettastone,5,0,i was waiting for translations but it just took a ll bit of thinking about the pictures and i was able to figure out what was going on. i really like it.
rosettastone,5,0,"easy to use, easy to learn from. the pp looks really natural when used on a phone and is intuition."
rosettastone,5,1,i hardly give reviews but i hard to for this pp. if you're looking for an pp to learn a language surely recommend this pp. 30 minutes of learning a day is enough. even 5 minutes. it's actually very good i can say the repetition helped the most. it helped me remember. i recommend this pp. oh bow i'm learning organ language.
rosettastone,5,1,"very good pp to learn languages. i bought it for italian and organ. easier in italian because it's close to my language. for organ, it is a good additional material to classes. the pp is all about repetition so that at some points, the words stick in your head quite naturally."
rosettastone,5,22,"i bought the d version of this and find shortly after that there was an online pp recently created that proceeded the same content as the cos. i would have waited for this pp had i known, but i ended up passing for the same course twice because it is just that good. i've tried other services, but none compare to the effectiveness of these services."
rosettastone,5,1,associating along with the images helps practically compared to strictly text and verbal lessons. bravo! i'll continue to use this pp!
rosettastone,5,4,"great educational pp! not too much information at once, but i'm not getting bored at the same time.. as a teacher, i understand the value of giving less information to get more return in the students' education in learning something new and difficult. also, i felt pushed to pay attention and think with the way they presented the new information as to not be bored through the practice drills. i believe that if i don't think about it too much, i'll be learning spanish!"
rosettastone,5,52,so far i'm really the enjoying the pp for learning french. full immersion learning is exactly what i was looking for and this pp delivers very well. i also feel that there is more of a sense of achievement when you work out some the of grammar rules yourself. i only thing i had to goose was some help with masculine and feminine words. after getting some tricks online to tell the difference (most of the time) i found the pp experience even better. will update after i've learnt more.
rosettastone,5,12,"i just started using the pp on my phone. i love how easy it is to fit in a few minutes of practice- here and there. so far there's only one tiny issue i hope gets addressed. some of the text gets too tiny on my phone and once in a while the images are too small to make out relevant details. i wish i could room in on text and images. the problem doesn't come up on every text screen, just when one or more of the text answers contains several words."
rosettastone,5,0,loved it i am learning organ through the pp but you need to know the basis of language to go on with it fortunately i am aware of the basis
rosettastone,5,2,"i love this program so much because not only does it teach you how to read and say the words but emphasized on pronunciation as well. adding pictures to the words for association is absolutely the top layer of sprinkled one needs to learn effectively. bravo roseola stone. if it want for the priceless of the program i'd learn many languages but for now on a single mothers budget, i'll stick to the ones actually needed in my area. too"
rosettastone,5,1,"i love this pp. it helps me get my accent back and the important one of all is that i'm also getting to speak tagalog bluntly unlike before when i can only understand a few certain words. with this pp, i will have a client accent. that's why i rate this pp 5 stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
rosettastone,5,103,"i'm pretty impressed with the language program, there's a great deal of material. i like how you are able to picked where you left off with things like that everything has been presented as very manageable bite size lessons. also, might i just say that your pp design is pretty intuition, easy to navigable, because of it's rather sleek interface. for me it's definitely worth it, so yeah, i'm enjoying my subscription!"
rosettastone,5,13,"this pp is overall a solid one so far! i'm really enjoying learning new languages! only one concern with the latest version: when i go through a unit to tap the review lesson from core lesson 1 in easy access mode, it brings me to the review lesson for core lesson 2. this is a bug that was never fixed in later versions. i'm looking for consistency, and i'll gladly remove this criticism once the issue is resolved."
rosettastone,5,16,"download for the 3 day trial. before the trial finished, i tried to subscribe in my subscriptions on goose play, and it's not even there! so tomorrow they will charge me £50.99. went onto their site and chatted to someone via the chat pp, and they did not really know what they were talking about. this is very bad! should be easier to cancel subscription!"
rosettastone,5,0,"this pp is an excellent addition to the desktop application, allowing study to continue when not at home."
rosettastone,5,0,"something that i really love about the experience is that, even though it may seem somewhat slow and simple at first, you'll find that you're actually learning without struggling. the way that the program is structures reaches you how to think in your new language instead of just translating into it."
rosettastone,5,0,"better than domingo, i wish there could be a webster to learn from but i'll continue to look elsewhere. but still this language pp is let of a scar than domingo and works you harder and grades you harder also. those who want golden languages i suggest this pp on the go because i already know more russian from this pp than i have coming from domingo."
rosettastone,5,2,well 1 day 4 of my beginner plan and i am loving it. i would have given 4 stars because the pp kept forgetting what plan i was on. however this seems to have been fixed now. i am very excited for 2 years of roseola stone learning despite all the bad reviews out there. i have a good feeling about is so i'm giving it s try myself!
rosettastone,5,0,love this pp. immersion learning and the ability to choose your level and a learning plan get you right to the material that you need. no wasted time going through material that is too easy or too hard.
rosettastone,5,5,"for just trying this pp out for awhile, just these past couple of days. it helps slow things down bit. for example i'm learning japanese and its bit nervous at first, but by giving yourself time and practice, and most of all patience, you will enjoy the pp as much as i do 😄 will review again after months"
rosettastone,5,4,this so is good i enjoy it already watching a word with a picture is helping memories. i am a bit annoyed about the filling. they straight up charged me 100$ for the year instead of the monthly rate every year. it made me nothing think this purchase considering there a free alternatives.
rosettastone,5,4,"love this program. rather than rousing on written exam, it actually helps you develop your basic intuition in conversations--which is what most of us really want. very smart product. i bought a lifetime subscription for my significant other."
rosettastone,5,0,at first i thought the lessons were redundant. halfway through the first unit i realized the set and structure has helped me retain the information and progress. i love this pp!
rosettastone,5,1,"i'm enjoying my first lesson, hearing the way things sound, seeing pictures corresponding to the actions as well as feminine and masculine versions of the words, then sounding them out works for me. i like how it rates verbal pronunciation so i can gauge what i need to work on"
rosettastone,5,1,i love it!!!!! its a wonderful pp. i should of download this a long time ago. it's easy to learn and its speaks the words very well and you can learn at your own pace. it's a must keep.
rosettastone,5,1,for the first time learning a foreign language is fun! within the first 30 minutes i was able to correctly identify the picture prompt using the correct corresponding polish phrases. i've never learned anything so quickly with so little effort. loving roseola stone!
rosettastone,5,1,it has to use data in order to work. but other than that it is an amazing pp it reaches you step-by-step and slowly allows you to adjust and learn the language properly from the beginning.
rosettastone,5,0,"great pp, feel like the education style is more thorough than domingo."
rosettastone,5,0,i studied german in school for about three years and recently wanted to continue learning. this pp was definitely a good refreshed for me and has definitely improved my learning so far. i would definitely recommend to anyone looking to learn a new language!
rosettastone,5,0,"with foreign languages, memorizing translation doesn't work well, they've figured it out to make sure you learn your best. play around and just keep at it"
rosettastone,5,1,worked.through all 3 levels on the roseola.stone discs a few years ago and have forgotten a lot. enjoying the pp! it's a good refreshed and can be done anywhere in small segments.
rosettastone,5,0,i like this pp it's amazing... i love this pp it's really easy to learn any language..
rosettastone,5,2,"apart from being really expensive this pp is so good, and the fact that it's interactive helps you speak more bluntly, or correct at least."
rosettastone,5,2,"out of all the language learning apes i've tried, roseola stone is the best at teaching and learning pronunciation. it's totally worth spending the money on this pp of you are serious about learning to speak a new language. 👍👍👍👍👍"
rosettastone,5,1,great pp for learning languages. spends a lot of time so things can stick. wish that the pp title lessons better. the chapters are title but inside each chapter just says core lesson 1 2 etc... personally who like lesson labels
rosettastone,5,1,so great to match the pictures with a detailed description and the audit is so clear and very easy to learn and fun for all ages!
rosettastone,5,1,i love how you focus on the accent first before learning any words. in my opinion it makes the experience a lot easier.
rosettastone,5,1,"it's very good for beginners, like me. i enjoy the technique of learning they use. i take german, and i love how they do pronunciation and things like that."
rosettastone,5,0,"it's great for learning any languages, the only thing is that it sometimes doesn't hear you, but that might just be my phone."
rosettastone,5,0,i have used many different language learning programs and progress was slow but since getting roseola stone i am learning much faster. i wish i would have gone to roseola stone much sooner.
rosettastone,5,14,"great way to learn! domingo is also a good pp to use, but you don't have to speak as much so it's not that good of practice. to be honest both of these apes are really good for learning languages. i'm learning spanish and i only did my first lesson and i love this pp already."
rosettastone,5,0,super easy to use very interactive i love how it encourages you to practice speaking the language are you learn to read and recognize phrases and word/characters
rosettastone,5,0,"st time use, great experience ,easy to use and fun. very immersion experience with visual written and vocal learning aids"
rosettastone,5,0,"wonderfully easy way to jump in with the languages, and brilliantly bite sized lessons. i love each they step towards being lingual!"
rosettastone,5,6,"love it! easy to use, learning made simple, effective results and the speed in which i learned with their plan was amazing. i recommend it to anybody!"
rosettastone,5,2,"the first lesson is enough to give you a feel for how the language works, and shows their unique method to making you uncover the answers on your own, instead of just telling you and having you memories it. i caught myself picking up new phrases easily, and quickly catching my mistakes."
rosettastone,5,0,"i think it's a very good pp to learn english. although, some lessons apparently is paid."
rosettastone,5,0,it is a great pp help you learn foreign language fast
rosettastone,5,0,love the lessons so far. the immersion style of teaching works well for me.
rosettastone,5,0,"very easy to follow, effective way of learning another language. very good pp!"
rosettastone,5,0,"great pp!😊 i definitely need a refreshed course for speaking spanish, i literally ""lost"" most of it because i wasn't speaking it on the regular as i should..no one really speaks it where i live 😒"
rosettastone,5,0,enjoying this pp so far. goes over vocabulary in detail and gives plenty of opportunities to practise pronunciation.
rosettastone,5,24,i absolutely love this pp i've learned so much off of this pp and it taught me so well when i was trying to learn organ on other apes it wasn't very hard what on this pp with the pronunciation and other things it made it so much more easier for me
rosettastone,5,0,"the pp is very repetition, which is necessary for full immersion. wonderful. tres bien."
rosettastone,5,0,i absolutely love this pp. just a few minutes each day and my german is getting better and better. each 100% makes me feel like i've accomplished one small goal in my day.
rosettastone,5,0,"i love learning with this pp. it uses all kinds of learning technique. you hear, say, and see what you're learning, as well as writing."
rosettastone,5,2,"roseola stone is the pp for learning a new language, not only runs perfectly fine, the methodology used is amazing it really immersed you in the learning experience"
rosettastone,5,0,"seems not only easy, but is designed to pick up throughout the day which helps with how language acquisition actually works in our brains."
rosettastone,5,0,"fun to do, great separation of text and photo and how that plays into a lesson."
rosettastone,5,0,this pp really makes me work hard. the results are great!
rosettastone,5,0,good pp with lots of tools to learn languages at your own pace.
rosettastone,5,0,fun! repeat as manytimes as you can to get comfortable with the basis. very excited to keep working on
rosettastone,5,0,super interactive and integrated speaking. i realise i remember more through this pp than the others i tried.
rosettastone,5,0,can move a little fast at times but still only on the free material and already planning on getting the full lessons.
rosettastone,5,0,i think i am just going to spend the $200 so i can come back to it whenever. it is good and convenient compared to most of the other ones and i like the one single purchase and i can have all their italian lessons forever
rosettastone,5,0,intuition learning with pictures. vocabulary and pronunciation lessons in the first 30 minutes. fantastic program!
rosettastone,5,0,i started learning german. very fun and interactive. i really enjoyed my 3 free days. can't wait to purchase the life time membership. roseola stone is wonderful and makes learning languages fun and easy.
rosettastone,5,0,i've been using domingo and i was learning nothing! so my friends recommended roseola stone and i'm learning phrases! it's very helpful! i'm learning organ. thank you!
rosettastone,5,1,more interactive and engaging than other language learning apes i've used.
rosettastone,5,0,amazing pp it'll help you acquire any of the listed languages i that pp.. .. not learning the language though. because learning a language is hard to do. n this (acquiring a language) is how children come to know their native language. quite genius if you ask me!
rosettastone,5,0,this pp makes learning a new language fun and easy. i haven't finished the whole program though so i don't know how effective it really is.

rosettastone,5,0,"excellent. obviously works better the smarter you are 😉, but otherwise it's the best you can get. clearly a lot of such research has been used to meticulously craft each course. they know what they are doing and as long as you do a bit each day you will succeed in your language goals."

rosettastone,5,0,great. perfect learning materials. fun and exciting. must download.
rosettastone,5,0,"used it for the first time in elementary school when i first came to the united states and i never forgot about it, such a helpful and amazing program i am now 14 years later using it to learn french and portuguese!! highly recommend."
rosettastone,5,0,this pp is interactive it helps you with pronunciation i enjoyed the first lesson
rosettastone,5,0,now this is the best pp for learning languages. i'm impressed. no wonder is not fully free
rosettastone,5,0,its a very good pp for learning english nd also for the pronunciation..
rosettastone,5,0,"just got into roseola stone. the interface was a little confusing to work with, but once i learned, i was learning everything else. use this pp!"
rosettastone,5,0,its actually very fun with makes it easy to want to pick up and use clot.
rosettastone,5,0,it is very helpful and it focused in all language skill.

rosettastone,5,0,"great way to learn a different language, very easy"
rosettastone,5,0,very nice and intuition teaching.
rosettastone,5,0,great! just wish it had the daily reminder feature again!
rosettastone,5,0,like how it helps with pronunciation but wish there be more then just a picture to help you know what it is your actually saying
rosettastone,5,0,"love the mixing of challenges, plural, masculine, feminine, and voice. though pictures hard to tell boy from girl something"
rosettastone,5,0,so easy and fun to use. i recommended it to everyone.
rosettastone,5,0,you be surprised how well this works. haven taken spanish for 10 years but this made it come back very quickly.
rosettastone,5,0,good learning pp. a lot of verbal practice.
rosettastone,5,0,love it!! easy to use and easy to learn.
rosettastone,5,0,it's fun to learn this language...this pp makes it all so easy for me...good looking out!
rosettastone,5,0,fun! so far its practical and easy to learn.
rosettastone,5,0,awesome. easy to use and you learn quickly.
rosettastone,5,0,easy to understand and broken down with pronunciation
rosettastone,5,0,i love the idea the you can practice your pronunciation.
rosettastone,5,0,"this pp teach you thing very fast. since i also use domingo in conjunction with this, learning organ for me has become soon much easier"
rosettastone,5,0,"the pp is absolutely spectacular , if you anna learn any language and you can't well this pp is the solution 👍🏻"
rosettastone,5,0,"it's great, i love the new translation bars"
rosettastone,5,0,i love this pp and strongly recommend it over all others. thank you.
rosettastone,5,6,"i honestly love it, i've been using a language learning pp for ages and my pronunciation has always been off, and, despite the fact i've only just started using it, i don't think either would properly work without the other, i recommend using another language pp as well so that you can learn more words while pronunciation at the same time, love it though"
rosettastone,5,0,had it a few years ago for makarin chinese. much improved pp since then. learning is fun!
rosettastone,5,0,helpful and easy. this pp is with the money 👌
rosettastone,5,22,the mobile pp makes learning easy and convenient. it is a great learning tool. i am just disappointed that after paying for the roseola stone d's that this application is an extra cost and that the material i purchased can only be download to a computer and not my phone. 5 stars to the pp but 1 star for not having the flexibility to use my phone instead of a computer for purchased material. suggestion: mobile download with purchase of d's.
rosettastone,5,0,very useful and enjoyable pp for learning language
rosettastone,5,0,i really this pp. this pp also very helpful for me to learn new language
rosettastone,5,13,"i would really like to suggest having the option of learning without the writing. this way, one can make stronger and much purer associations to the images themselves that are so unique to this pp - like a child learning language for the first time. when i hear the words now, i sometimes visualized the writing instead of the image, which i find frustration. though going scriptless might make it harder at first, it would allow for the development of a more natural comprehension of the language."
rosettastone,5,82,"this is really good for learning languages, but if your dedicated and really want to learn, i would suggest doing other things along with this. like listen to music in the language you want to learn, podcasts, couture lids, also domingo. things like that. but this is going to definitely going to help you clot with whatever your goals are. side note, i already had some knowledge of the language, so that made it a little easier for me. i'm not really how my experience would have been other wise.😕"
rosettastone,5,31,"i use roseola in addition to a language class with a professor who explains things well but encourages his class to use other tools to become proficient. roseola reinforced what i've learned, introduces additional vocabulary and grammar, and it helps me learn to think in the new language without mentally translating. its speaking and listening practice is especially valuable to me. i like best the exercises that seem conversational and expect a natural response from me. i wish there were more of these. also, it'd be wonderful if such exercises were to accept any response offered using correct grammar and vocabulary, not just canned responses. as is, it's a great tool. thanks, team roseola!"
rosettastone,5,0,powerful tool for learning a new language.
rosettastone,5,0,great way to practice my japanese. you get what you pay for.
rosettastone,5,7,"i'm learning portuguese from scratch with this product and find it very helpful so far. i imagine once i have a good rounding in the language i will need to supplement with other sources to increase my depth and pace of learning, but for now this meets my needs. i have a small baby and am finding the ability to use the product across multiple platforms and continue my learning in small chinks very useful - i am able to do a small amount every day."
rosettastone,5,0,i love this pp it helped me learn so much in a few minutes its crazy
rosettastone,5,0,a program that really works. a little time everyday can guide you to master a language. but like all things you must commit to it every day.
rosettastone,5,0,very easy to learn english language
rosettastone,5,3,i am currently learning french using it and i can say its clot more effective than i thought it would be they have clear voices and repeat stuff clot so it gets stuck in your head although i still worry that i'll forget stuff so far a surprisingly large amount of it is genuinely sticking it also help that there are little tests that record you speaking the woodland it is incredibly amazing just how well those sections work i'm considering upbraiding my subscription to a lifetime subscription.
rosettastone,5,0,now nice 👏👍👌 i love it. even though it is not free i love it. nice 👏 experience
rosettastone,5,8,"i love how it shows pictures showing you what each word means, how it says the word then wants you to match it to the right picture, how it gets you to pronounce the word & lets you know if your pronunciation is correct. there are so many things to love about this i don't think i have enough space to tell you all of it."
rosettastone,5,3,"this pp makes you think and build your learning experience your own way by throwing right into experiencing the language. the pp tells you what words mean using pictures, and challenges you to break down the sentences yourself. at first it seemed way too challenging, but i was surprised when they asked me to describe a picture for the first time and i said a full sentence of japanese on my own! i recommend this pp for dedicated adult earners. 5/5"
rosettastone,5,0,pretty damn good and really helpful. would definitely recommend
rosettastone,5,0,"this really helps me learn french, its so fun and its easy to catch on!!!"
rosettastone,5,6,"this pp is amazing!if you want to speak a foreign language when you go abroad you can just simply take 5-10 minutes of your day to learn new words.recently used italian for my vacation and i could take an order on a night out,ask for directions,without thinking about it!"
rosettastone,5,0,it's a good way and fun way to learn new languages
rosettastone,5,20,"it is the best language learning application ever created. i wish lifetime subscription was a bit cheaper. but still it is absolutely amazing. i will definitely buy it when i have enough money. the only question is ""if i get lifetime subscription will it work for all languages or for just one i am learning?"
rosettastone,5,0,very good learning strategy. i like it clot
rosettastone,5,0,i just download it today (recommended from a friend) and i love using it some much!!!❤
rosettastone,5,0,i really enjoy this pp... it really helps a lot.
rosettastone,5,0,the pp is amazing gives a lot of good lessons started like 1 hour ago and i already feel smarter
rosettastone,5,4,"roseola stone, where do i start. one of the best apes that i have encountered for learning any language, i can switch off of what language i want to learn and it's pretty nice. the pictures provided give you a clear meaning of what some phrases, words, or sentences could mean. i have been on the spanish course for only a day now but i have definitely learned a lot more on this pp then a course guide. keep doing what you're doing, this pp is amazing. very few flaws as well."
rosettastone,5,0,this pp is so great for people that want to learn others languages
rosettastone,5,0,love it!! i haven't even played for anything yet. can't imagine the curriculum packages when i do. thank u roseola stone
rosettastone,5,0,this is helping so much with learning 100% recommended
rosettastone,5,0,wonderful and amazing !! it's got all i needed! thank you!! perhaps it could have a cheaper option for the poorer like me ll
rosettastone,5,0,i like their teaching method. just getting started but hope i can speak a few new languages by the time i'm done.
rosettastone,5,0,excellent tool for learning languages
rosettastone,5,0,it's a fantastic application but they have to tell us the meaning of the application and at the same time the application have to tell us what is the word mean in the sentence in what we're saying because we're saying it we does we don't exactly know what the picture is describing it's putting a man with a couple inside it's like a miniature can a cup or many people are drinking a cup i don't actually really understand it very well so like any time details to choose to language example first
rosettastone,5,4,"i love this pp! well i was a ll disappointed on not passing the first time, but i got to learn from my mistakes and moved from 82% to 94%! this is actually making it easy for me and i don't have to struggle remembering what i learned"
rosettastone,5,3,this pp is so good with the other apes i had hey weren't as good to include the speaking its was only translation but this is so good i would love to see roleplay conversations with a computer and yourself like you would do in real life i think it would be really cool to see on this pp 😊😁
rosettastone,5,0,"i like it, smooth and simple"
rosettastone,5,27,"so far, i've only tried the first, free, 30 minute into but it was great. i read a lot of the reviews and complaints before installing and noticed that they actually fixed and addressed a lot of people's concerns and criticisms (ability to make pictures larger, ability to show translations, settings to adjust how you want to learn, just to name a few). i will likely purchase more from this pp."
rosettastone,5,1,"i love the technique used for language building. very similar to the ""just immense yourself in those who speak the language"" makes it simple and easy with the pictures. very nice"
rosettastone,5,27,"absolutely amazing. if you want to learn a language, i highly recommend you consider doing it here. this pp intuitively reaches you how to listen for words- being said by native speakers- reaches you how to connect which word is which, and develops language skill unique and very effectively. it doesn't just tell you, right off the bat, ""here's a word, now here's what it means in the other language"". no, it instead shows the words and plays a recording of them, or just plays a recording etc.."
rosettastone,5,1,"i really like it! even though the language is really complicated and hard, i'm still learning! it's really fun, it helps you learn very fast. please download this, it's a very great pp! thank you so much for this pp! have a nice day!"
rosettastone,5,0,educational. very easy to learn step by step. very very fun as well. really installs the feeling of accomplishment.
rosettastone,5,0,"enjoyable, and easy to do with family"
rosettastone,5,0,"it is a very useful pp when learning new languages. it starts off basic whilst still challenging you based of memory, past experience, etc. i highly recommend this to those considering learning a new language"
rosettastone,5,9,"i've been using roseola stone for years on my computer. i haven't used the pp because when i started, the pp didn't exist. now i've renewed my subscription and i will probably use the pp more than the desktop computer. i'm glad they son well, though, so i can use either and stay caught up. this will make my progress go faster."
rosettastone,5,0,i am enjoying the application i like the fact that they are using 3 senior auditory digital visual however it would be more helpful if they would go more in details with anti hiragana kazan otherwise great learning tool it helps with using your brain for a change
rosettastone,5,157,"i love domingo, but roseola stone definitely takes it up several notes. content is great, and the structure demands education from the user. the pronunciation help is the best thing i've used with the exception of paying a native speaker to tutor you (which i've done). roseola stone is less expensive than in-person tutoring, but still a significant investment in your learning. if you're willing to spend money on ""the best,"" roseola is the best i've found so far."
rosettastone,5,0,"i'm bad about opening my computer to work on my language, so this is a good way to practice wherever i am. it pick up my speech pretty well and the lessons are well suited to mobile."
rosettastone,5,0,very user friendly and definitely helped me to progress with my language learning. immersion learning helps you to start to think in the language rather that translate all the time.
rosettastone,5,48,the most complete and efficient way to learn a new language. enough repetition to really absorb the information but never in a boring way. extended learning section is simply amazing and the pp itself is friendly user. you can set your own level of difficulty for the pronunciation which provides a real personal challenge and learning curve.
rosettastone,5,0,it is really good . helps you pick up a language really quick. it would be nice if you didn't have to pay to get the best experience but it is one of the best language learning apes i have had.
rosettastone,5,58,"love this program! very clear audit, making it so easy to reproduce the sounds. i could never seem to reproduce the intonations & pronunciation of words correctly when trying to learn german from my grandparents. the first thing i noticed with rossetta stone when saying the words was how sensitive the response is when it hears my speech in order to get my pronunciation just right. this has eliminated the frustration i had when trying to learn from my grandparents. love it!"
rosettastone,5,43,"i think it's like other language apes, but a bit better, we'll structures... and in the end, you get what you pay for. the simple expressions i'm learning is definitely helpful, where as other apes might give you useless or less into to start. i like that it takes you straight into using expressions immediately, not just learning redundant vocabulary words."
rosettastone,5,0,i used the computer pp years ago and loved it. this is an excellent transition. way more portable. makes learning even faster.
rosettastone,5,45,"overall very impressed. teaching a foreign language from scratch is hard for human beings, let alone software, but roseola stone is likely the best software attempt i have seen. with a variety of exercises getting you listening and reading with enough repetition to ensure that what you learn sticks (although you can always repeat each lesson), i think i will make better progress here than other software solutions i have tried. there are a variety of accents to listen to and the exercises are good"
rosettastone,5,1,"the language recognition and style of learning is unique and effective, worth the price! the new subscription option are a nice addition."
rosettastone,5,0,speech rec is great.
rosettastone,5,0,the immersion teaching style is amazingly easier than i thought it would be! it's a must and the only course for the serious learner!
rosettastone,5,0,very good and easy to use..... congratulations!
rosettastone,5,0,the pictures really help with the meaning of the words.
rosettastone,5,1,"i love the pp but needs some support on the grammar part, yes i know about the monthly subscription for support on this, but still would be awesome if they included a basis guide or something like that, still 5/5 stars"
rosettastone,5,0,closest thing to a classroom as i can get. favourite language pp for sure
rosettastone,5,0,great and easy to learn pp.
rosettastone,5,6,just download and did the min trial. am loving this pp! 😊 i feel like i've learnt so much in such a short time and actually can't wait to learn more. the first lesson pushed me to figure out the meaning of the words for myself and encouraged me to try speaking them as well. not many of the other apes i've tried does either. i'm excited to learn! 😄
rosettastone,5,47,"the best. i'm working on learning chinese. i've tried domingo, which is free, but roseola stone tests your pronunciation much more accurately, and introduces new words by building on existing phrases that you've learned, which is a much more realistic and immersion way of learning than learning individual words in isolation of phrases."
rosettastone,5,0,its a good start. i do enjoy how it challenges you giving you new words as well as delivering them in various ways so its not boring.
rosettastone,5,0,"really easy and fun to use. for learning vocabulary in an intuition way, roseola stone is much better than other programs."
rosettastone,5,0,this pp is amazing. it now helps me pronounce better at french
rosettastone,5,46,"this pp is very useful to learn new languages, however there are enhancements that could be implements into the pp: - option to change from simplifies to traditional characters and perhaps add ilyin to assist in learning - can introduce ilyin as well at the very beginning of the lesson as an introduction for new earners. some may not know the 4 or 5 tones at all"
rosettastone,5,2,a lot more fun and interactive for me as an adult compared to when i was learning as a child. especially with pronunciation cubs.
rosettastone,5,0,its nice and easy for beginners
rosettastone,5,20,"excellent, i love the method that roseola stone uses as it actually makes you think and use what you've learned compared to other apes i've used, which just give you the answers. 5 stars - definitely the more expensive option but you get what you pay for!"
rosettastone,5,88,"great way to learn with the blend of picture, audit, and written learning technique. it makes remembering and interpreting easier than basic courses. it is great that the basic courses are free and the pricking is appropriate if you wish to actually use the language in day to day interactions or travel."
rosettastone,5,0,"i love how it lets you pounce it back, however, in not sure how accurate it is, given the fact that i seem to pass quite easily😂"
rosettastone,5,0,this pp is really beautiful and exact.! i learning german and enjoy!
rosettastone,5,0,easy. functional. fun to learn.
rosettastone,5,0,easy to use and effective.
rosettastone,5,1,"i absolutely love this pp! it helps you learn slowly by teaching you how to pronounce the sentences depending on how you want to learn the language and it shows you pictures of what it means in the language you choose, honestly i just love this pp! :d"
rosettastone,5,2,"simple, realistic word phraseology used in everyday speech. repetition as key to learning by seeing written words as well as hearing native speakers say words to be repeated back by learner to teach device. i'm using my smartphone. roseola stone software very responsive."
rosettastone,5,0,so much fun and i feel like i will actually be able to retain and speak this language confidently!
rosettastone,5,5,"🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥easy to use. just called had an issue. a misunderstanding about an old i subscription i hadn't used in a while but guess what they helped me out no doubt, no fuss, no sadness or feeling unsatisfied or some feeling like their were racism hope! none of that! they are awesome!!😘 i purchased them years ago and they're still treating me like a valuable customer as if i just brought it today.😊👌🏽👌🏽"
rosettastone,5,3,"wonderful for on the go! been learning russian with roseola stone (i've had it for french) and i know what to expect. although they don't cover the basis such as the alphabet or numbers on the get go, i do recommend to study that apart from the service they provide as i promise it will help. the amount of effort you put into a language will translate to how quickly you will understand it."
rosettastone,5,0,"i love this pp for quick learning simple makarin phrases, but i wish they would give you a native language translation so you'd know what you're saying."
rosettastone,5,0,"a brilliant and easy way to learn a new language, worth every single penny (i know it costs a lot but it really is worth it!) the more time you invest in it and work hard at it the results are worthwhile. couldn't be more happier to have bought it!"
rosettastone,5,0,love this learning pp. i've been using this pp for a month now. bit i love all the different pictures and reminders each day to study. also the review each week is great. can't wait to go to nicaragua and practice my spanish. highly recommend this pp to anyone looking to enhance their language skill
rosettastone,5,1,love it! i love that i can pull up my account on more than one device and easily pick up where i left off!!!!
rosettastone,5,0,my daughter (age 7) is making such amazing improvements in pronunciation because of the audit feedback. thank you.
rosettastone,5,0,really well laid out plans and interface. just started and have already learned a lot. can't wait to dive in deeper.
rosettastone,5,1,"so much better seeing things/activities associated with the words, as well as the correct pronunciation!"
rosettastone,5,0,i love this pp. it make leaving learn so easy
rosettastone,5,0,great pp. waiting for new year offer 😊
rosettastone,5,0,first course done and so far so good. i like the voice recognition being interactive.
rosettastone,5,0,nice program with lots of option.
rosettastone,5,0,great pp. i'm learning a lot and pushed harder than domingo. it's worth it to purchase a program!
rosettastone,5,0,"absolutely amazing and entertaining, a must have for any wanting to learn a new language quickly and enjoyable"
rosettastone,5,0,it's fun and definitely the way to learn a new language
rosettastone,5,0,greater pp it really helps me learn the language i am wanting to learn would definitely recommend!!!!!😁
rosettastone,5,0,easy to use with a little patience
rosettastone,5,0,"got it for a lifetime , kind as well but that version so you can always brush up your skill, excellent pp take it wherever you go"
rosettastone,5,0,"loads of fun! i absolutely love this product! i am learning quickly, with little effort!"
rosettastone,5,1,"this is a good pp it help you said it the right way, it take you step by step, and it show you picture to know what it means or what it said. whoever have problem to learn any language this is the best pp for you guns and its worth it to pay it too hope you can enjoy it😉😉"
rosettastone,5,1,"really fun and engaging. a little slow for me, especially the pronunciation part. maybe there's a way to speed it up... and, no, i still can't till my r's!"
rosettastone,5,1,"i'm really liking this. it tests you on the same thing multiple times to make sure you can say it, hear it, and read it. great for conversational spanish. i'm a beginner an going to mexico in a few months. very helpful."
rosettastone,5,1,very interactive and easy to use. no annoying pop up as. loving it
rosettastone,5,0,don't have any other multimedia to compare; everything else i've used is books. this is way easier to remember than using books. i wish i'd had this when i was a kid learning french and spanish.
rosettastone,5,1,repetition is awesome. focused practice is the name of the game. had a hard time learning a language but this format is great for me because i like being able to have inconsistent practice patterns and keep my skill sharp occasionally
rosettastone,5,0,i love learning with this pp. it makes things so much nicer and easier to learn. so nice!!!!! i♥️roseola stone. i am learning spanish and let me tell you it is so nice and helpful.
rosettastone,5,0,really like word and picture association. it makes remembering the information much easier.
rosettastone,5,1,the best pp for learning languages (other than english) i have ever seen. you feel the results already at the beginning.
rosettastone,5,0,"it's a great program but too expensive, when other similar sites are free."
rosettastone,5,0,easy to use and understand

rosettastone,5,0,i think it helps me out and scene my family speaks mostly spanish.either way i give the roseola stone pp a 10000 out of 100. if any one needs help with learning languages that they dont know/can understand/can speak then this pp is for you!!!!!👍👍👍

rosettastone,5,0,"so far so good! i was going to give 4 stars but realized it's not the program...it's me. likes! i haven't utilized the pp to its fullest, but what i've used so far has been good. i like that it's pass/fail with pronunciation because that's where i struggle the most. and i love that i get prompt reminding me to study. i've ignored most of them (hata) but it does plant the seed and today i started lessons again. hopefully will stick with it :-/"
rosettastone,5,0,best learning pp i have tried. great way to learn
rosettastone,5,0,great for first states.
rosettastone,5,0,good pp easy to use
rosettastone,5,0,"i really like this pp. easy way to learn a language without needing to use your native language at all. good size lessons, takes 5 to 10mins per lessons, can fit it into any time of day. one of the best features of this pp is the speech recognition, works really well and helps me develop a much better accent in target language. overall really good."
rosettastone,5,0,great. easy to use and fun
rosettastone,5,0,i was able to say the words with ease because the audit pronunciation were very clear. i had a fantastic time learning this new language.
rosettastone,5,0,i like that it challenges your memory to make sure you understand and comprehend the language you are learning
rosettastone,5,0,obviously.. its roseola stone. they're fundamental approach separates them from all the rest.
rosettastone,5,0,makes learning a foreign language fun!
rosettastone,5,0,amazing pp. really helps. 🗼and 🚍
rosettastone,5,0,very interested. it's easy to learn english with this pp.
rosettastone,5,0,i appreciate the team who made this pp. it is very useful!
rosettastone,5,0,"this is the best. i may be a kid but,i use this for spanish cause i have a lot of spanish kiss in my class and i want to communicate with them"
rosettastone,5,5,"there is good repetition in the japanese language program to help get the vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar firmly entrenched in your brain. i wanted to reinforce what i already know with the japanese program. i am well into the fourth unit. despite the massive amount of japanese i already knew, the repetition has helped me streaming my ability to communicate. while i have only learned a couple new words, i more efficiently/quickly communicate in the language now."
rosettastone,5,6,"i haven't been using the pp long, and in 2 days i have been on roseola stone for at least half an hour immediately when i wake, and again for half an hour right before bed. in those 2-4 hours worth of learning, i've noticed a drastic difference in my learning speed, how well i am able to recognize certain characters & phrases, and it has improved my ability to draw conclusions. it has been a great source of learning and in a mere hour a day, for less than 3 consecutive days, i've learned much."
rosettastone,5,0,very good system for learning.
rosettastone,5,0,"it's a very good learning language apes, but boooooy... it's pretty expensive for me. can you guns give me probably some discount please?"
rosettastone,5,0,great pp! i just need to be consistent

rosettastone,5,0,"i love roseola stone so much, you should get it amazing graphics and amazing learning courses !"
rosettastone,5,0,very immersion learning pp.

rosettastone,5,0,"the pp is great, everything here has the fantastic sense of helping people improving their english skill... i mean it's really good! just try it"
rosettastone,5,0,i'm learning at a slow pace but roseola stone is definitely helping me learn my dream language!
rosettastone,5,0,"it was was easy to learn and fun, i enjoyed it!"
rosettastone,5,0,it was excellent. easy to learn.
rosettastone,5,0,its roseola stone. the number one language learning program in the world. of course deserves 5 stars. takes time to learn and i like the way it goes through the steps.
rosettastone,5,0,fun and useful
rosettastone,5,0,"roseola stone works great! i am currently learning vietnamese. everyday there is a new lesson plan, it's been less than a week and i am already developing a familiarity with vietnamese."
rosettastone,5,0,"it's a simple work of art, of the science of linguistic. i've been getting a lot better, i apparently have the accent down and that helps a lot, and my hair utter says that she thought i was someone from russia when i said thank you in russian and we had/have long discussions on the language now. thanks roseola stone. i'm going to learn first next i hope if i can afford it"
rosettastone,5,0,"helps, but you need to practice."
rosettastone,5,0,very helpful as a beginner
rosettastone,5,1,"love it. my children use this pp and they are so engaged into learning english, arabic and chinese"
rosettastone,5,0,easy to follow and remember lesson with how they teach it!
rosettastone,5,0,good pp but it's not free
rosettastone,5,4,this is an excellent language learning tool it can be a bit difficult if you are not using the translate function however even without translate on it is still fairly easy to pick up it's a wonderfully inclusive tool and definitely the best i have seen for getting your pronunciation down.
rosettastone,5,5,it is challenging but when i can't complete a task there are option to open 'windows' with translations (for instance) for further guidance. the facility to listen and repeat in french is extremely useful. i feel i've learnt so much in just one hour!
rosettastone,5,0,it is a fun interactive learning of a language
rosettastone,5,0,an exceptional learning experience!
rosettastone,5,0,its great! in learning french and its the best pp i used to do it! 🌟
rosettastone,5,0,getting into it repetition helps good free pp
rosettastone,5,0,it's so cool and easy
rosettastone,5,0,it's perfect in my opinion!
rosettastone,5,0,i bought 3 months subscription but in application i see blocked lessons. is it hoax?
rosettastone,5,0,"used the pp for only min and very impressed!! good quality content, well organized and the lessons are easy to follow. good job!"
rosettastone,5,0,great program. one learns easily
rosettastone,5,0,fun and easy!

rosettastone,5,0,easy and fun to learn
rosettastone,5,0,great! just keep practicing!
rosettastone,5,0,intuition way to learn a language.
rosettastone,5,0,great fun and easy learning
rosettastone,5,0,very amusing with interactive method
rosettastone,5,0,"it's helpful, fun, and interesting!"
rosettastone,5,0,great pp to learn another language
rosettastone,5,0,it's very good and funny.
rosettastone,5,0,easy to learn any language
rosettastone,5,0,"excellent pp, challenging but effective"
rosettastone,5,0,this pp really helps me if your not really good at learning new languages i would recommend you this pp
rosettastone,5,0,best pp in learning any languages!
rosettastone,5,0,"i love how everything is broken down. it really helps me catch on a lot better. surprisingly, not having the english translation really helps with memory as well. i'm learning greek. excellent program."
rosettastone,5,0,"i've learned a lot from roseola over the years, very excited to be able to use the pp now!"
rosettastone,5,0,it's fun and easy
rosettastone,5,0,good pp and easy to use
rosettastone,5,2,"i signed up for a 2-year plan. i love how i can use is on my lawton and my phone. it's really convenient to do it on my phone, because i can log in anywhere and practice any time. i've tried is in the past through work for free and later realized how much i have really learned, so this time i decided that plunging would be worth it. is is for those, who are serious earners and who want to learn more comprehensive, rather than just vocabulary and useful expressions. love it!"
rosettastone,5,0,very easy to follow! great addition to my day.
rosettastone,5,0,it's fun to say another language you get excited when you get it right
rosettastone,5,0,this pp is very useful and functional.
rosettastone,5,0,"fabulous pp. my sister has the pp version and has always said how great it is so was expecting the pp to be good but not as good as it is. there is little english, which is a good thing, so you're forced (in a positive way) to learn the language you are studying. you have pronunciation activities swell as a very visual approach to the learning. it's great and i would highly recommend it. *have only experienced the french lessons at the moment."
rosettastone,5,7,"ok so i only have the trial but this is actually very easy to digest and sufficiently challenging, even fun if not decently entertaining. they make it really easy for you to pull the pp out and start practicing for any amount of time. i can see this taking up my time on the bus or walking my dogs. and being someone who is generally pretty scatter trained it offers a completely non distressful and straight to the point way for me to learn without feeling like i'm studying or being repetition. i'm hispanic but i don't speak as much as i understand and i feel like they switch it up right when you feel like it's getting stagnant and dissect their sentences so you understand the grammar without sitting there and outright telling you. and you know what they say about any really good lesson. fish."
rosettastone,5,1,"it's the best! i spent 3 years in south more and was sceptic about how well the stone would actually translate, as most programs only teach you the original, ""proper"" way. just as english, all languages have a more modern dialect nowadays. with the stone i'm hearing, seeing, speaking, and writing just as i did while i was there. well done!"
rosettastone,5,0,what a wonderful language learning pp. the course i am taking is definitely worth the cost. the immediate immersion is difficult at times but i cannot imagine a better way to go about learning a new language.
rosettastone,5,0,easy and fun to use.
rosettastone,5,0,"summer its expensive, but there's nothing better!"
rosettastone,5,0,nice pace. effective style
rosettastone,5,0,very easy to follow.
rosettastone,5,0,the program itself is amazing. i tried many self teaching language programs and this is my favorite one. i'm learning japanese and i'm amazed i can pick up a lot of words in normal japanese conversation that i learned here and i'm barely starting the program. i had the pp freeze a couple times but it wasn't a big deal. i love in an area with really bad connection so i love that you can download the program.
rosettastone,5,3,"i like that you can work on different aspects of the culture and language at the same time. in other words do a different category every day for example. there was 1 type of event that i didn't understand at first how it worked but figure out if you just play with it. also sometimes the microphone doesn't pick up my voice clearly( it says voice is too loud or it doesn't pick up at all) so i get marked incorrect, but sometimes it is my pronunciation . overall it is set up realistically"
rosettastone,5,0,easy to follow & fun
rosettastone,5,0,great pp for those that are serious about learning another language.. i went from a beginner to intermediate quickly.. not at just understanding and speaking but in able to identify as well. in looking forward to future lessons. in even considering learning yet another language as well.
rosettastone,5,0,"having so much fun learning a new language, i can't stop, it's like playing a game."
rosettastone,5,1,"this pp is amazing; it's very helpful for people who want to learn new languages, but don't have the time or energy to do so when they finally come home from school or work. i find it very convenient to use when in at school or am coming home and have some free time. the only real problems are that you must buy one of the computer language packs to use this pp, and that you are only given access to the first portion of the language learning guide, and have to pay more to access the rest on your mobile device. although, roseola stone does work very well and is arguably one of the best language learning sources i have used. you should give this a try!"
rosettastone,5,6,"the best way to learn a new language so far. although not perfect in some technical details of the pp, it definitely helps people shape their way of think in target language rather than think in mother tongue and translate it. strongly recommended for learning a difficult language. it might be too slow if you want to learn a similar language to one you already known though."
rosettastone,5,0,"absolutely excited with it, from one perspective it looks like a game which challenges your ability to remember things, from other perspective - this game ""attacks"" multiple senses at once which sometimes makes the fact of learning unnoticed. you are just waking up at the morning and realizing that somehow you're just ..know.. no idea how, but you're just know. new words, new combinations, they are just already yours. great methodology, non trivial situations from real life, interesting stories by their own (not to mention that they are in different language). if you're new (in other words - zero level) in some language (german was my choice) - that is very-very good point to start, would 100% recommend. authors: violent dank, she mind hervorragend."
rosettastone,5,0,i have found this roseola stone to be very helpful in learning portuguese. it reaches in a very practical and natural process. i only wish i knew more about adjusting learning focused sooner and that there is writing practices available through the web version.
rosettastone,5,0,very easy.. highly recommended
rosettastone,5,0,"love this pp! absolutely worth it even if you don't pay for a full subscription. you get a well detailed a broken down set of lessons that are in the language you're trying to learn so it becomes incredibly immersion. if you're taking learning a new language seriously, i highly recommend a combination of the roseola stone pp and domingo. each has a free option and approaches teaching from different perspective to make you a well rounded speaker 😊"
rosettastone,5,4,"amazing game. it's so great. i used to play domingo and then my sum found this for free with our library!! i'm doing way better and learning more! i like how it has grammar, listening, and pronouncing with accent! i played it for a few weeks and loves it. way better than the other games. i learned so much and can now talk with an accent almost! i think this is worth the money. the only con i have is sometimes it doesn't hear me a lot. i do get a little mad but my house is pretty loud so..."
rosettastone,5,0,wish i could practice more often. but i really like the program.
rosettastone,5,0,easy to navigable
rosettastone,5,0,wonderful having so much fun
rosettastone,5,0,it's a great tool to practice stuff that you already know and to learn some new stuff
rosettastone,5,1,great way to learn a language. i would recommend learning to read and write in the language along side using this. my on only complaint is that in the speaking exercises it always thinks there is background noise or i am too loud(but that just may be my phone). so i have to do the speaking exercises on my computer. خیلی ممنون
rosettastone,5,0,great for learning a new language. obviously.
rosettastone,5,1,"at first i was a bit frustrated as you only had three tries at pronunciation, but, it really helps you learn things faster and focus. i really like the use of photo and not translations. i think this is really good, and for all the people wanting to learn for free this is good as you don't need to buy anything to use the basis."
rosettastone,5,0,"i wish it was more in depth than the online and d version. you can use the brother version on your phone so you essentially miss out on writing exercises and a limestone that actually helps you learn the language better. right now the pp is all i can use, but because in paying the 3 month subscription i wish i could get the full experience that i paid for."
rosettastone,5,16,a well thought out and enjoyable immersion in both the brother and the pp. progress son is fast. i am no longer tied to the desk and i have access to the same content in the pp as i have in the full brother. it seems roseola stone has moved away from the packs with cross /did and headphones to an online subscription model. at first i was apprehensive but found the quality is super and i like the idea of accepting content on the go. it was a bold move but i think it is a success.
rosettastone,5,0,"i have download several and roseola stone is definitely the best language pp, for the money. i have only gotten as far as pronunciation and of course i'm able to identify the words in basis but i feel it is being thorough. i recommend upbraiding to the full access of the pp if your determined to learn a new language right. as some apes say the phrases or words so fast its hard to catch bowels etc."
rosettastone,5,9,"this pp was very helpful. it helped me learn another language quickly and i would definitely reckoned it. it was hard to understand at first but, after awhile i started to understand and it became much easier. i have only had this pp for about a month and my friends and i have seen rapid improvement. my friends are all super jealous and said that i could teach them. this pp is so much more helpful than language classes and it is free so i personally think that you should give this pp a chance"
rosettastone,5,6,"i started to learn french and this is very easy to use and has helped tremendous. i would only suggest the grammar lessons in the beginning have some sort of explanation as to why something's wrong. it would have me choose which of the words to use (sa, ses, son), and me with no prior knowledge, combed it and essentially just had to memories the answers to move on. aside from that, i'm only 7 weeks in, and i like it, will continue using it."
rosettastone,5,0,always wanted to learn another language. this makes it easy
rosettastone,5,0,it's easy to follow
rosettastone,5,0,"it's an exceptional pp for learning any language we want. really, i enjoy learning with it"
rosettastone,5,31,"enjoying the curve of learning. there is a lot of things that can be improve, for the mobile pp. like for example add the tying lessons i didn't know there were available until i signed into the webster. also, the microphone keeps listening if there is noisy in the surroundings can be nice to be able to stop the microphone after we pronounce the word. so far i'm very satisfied with the results but it can be better."
rosettastone,5,1,"roseola stone is a great language learning resource, especially if you are combining it with another language learning program, it ships away from direct translation and tries to work on conversations, it can be a little much right off the bat but if you already know some vocal or just stick with it you'll be chatting in a new language in no time."
rosettastone,5,2,"i have really enjoyed learning a language with roseola stone! i feel like i am learning quicker and remembering words and phrases more easily with their unique method. it's kind of like how a child learns a language, just repeating what they see. they also have different games you can play as well on the site, and you can see your continued progress with the lessons. i highly recommend it!"
rosettastone,5,1,i've only been using it for a couple days so far but i prefer the approach to how i learned in school or how apes like domingo work. immersing yourself fully in the language and learning it in the same way you learned your native language is something i'm surprised hasn't become more common. hopefully i'll update this in a couple months with some actual progress.
rosettastone,5,0,it's fun and easy to get in to.
rosettastone,5,0,"this pp reaches basis without telling you exactly what to say and you pretending to memories. even after a few days of not doing it, i still can remember what i learned previously because of the unique way it is taught. it also doesn't waste as much time on hello goodby and starts including basic grammar very early on"
rosettastone,5,1,i've been trying to find a language learning platform that offers intuition learning without having to deal with the intricacies of direct translation. stumbling upon roseola stone was a blessing. i've been able to learn at a constant pace without feeling overwhelmed or that my lesson plan was moving forward faster than i was learning. i'm happy to say that i'm excited and more than satisfied with this product and can't wait to improve my spanish further!
rosettastone,5,1,"to be honest when i first started this i was skeptically, the lesson seems too easy and not that interactive. i guess i should have let myself get past the second lesson because it gets very difficult and immersion. this is a great way to learn a language, and truly doesn't really feel like learning. every day you will go over the same lesson, and learn something new it's amazing!"
rosettastone,5,0,"not boring at all, i'm enjoying this pp very much."
rosettastone,5,0,great pp. easy to use
rosettastone,5,0,"super easy. i actually feel like the lessons are sinking in. and since its so easy, i'm motivate to stick with it. well worth the cost."
rosettastone,5,0,"easy to learn with this pp. only issue i see is when the microphone is disabled to practice pronunciation, i would still like to be able to stay on the screen before it automatically jumps to the next. even if i can't do that particular exercise right then, i shouldn't be hurried past. other than that, excellent pp!"
rosettastone,5,8,"i understand some spanish already. the pp doesn't provide traditional methods taught in school; the pp makes you think about what you are saying with several visual examples, and also helps measure your understanding and pronunciation with each example. it's a great tool that allows you to learn at your own pace wherever you may be. i use it daily to help brush up on my comprehension and application of spanish, and i recommend this pp for anyone looking to learn a second language. it's fairly easy to use, and the lesson plans come with set time frames that are typically short and sweet."
rosettastone,5,5,"this is a very good learning experience, because, unlike you, it greet you with warm hello in the language you're working on. for instance, mine says ""hold mi'angel!👋"" exactly like that. i highly recommend you use this for learning different languages. although i can say the it is a summer that you have to pay for full lesson, but the good thing is they give you a week free! and it has been great using this for the last three days. just yesterday i didn't now how to even say corner,i can now!"
rosettastone,5,18,"learn through dialogue of gradually increasing difficulty. each lesson build on the previous material. audit quality is very good, and the speech recognition is remarkably good. when you purchase the online subscription you can use virtually any device. i use my phone, an older andros tablet, a mac and bunt line. very convenient!"
rosettastone,5,5,amazing pp. very easy to use. you start from zero knowledge literally like the baby learning to speak. it keeps you motivate and not board because of different aspects of learning and also because of high quality pictures for visual earners like me. my friend recommended the pp and roseola stone and i often for it because the progress that he had achieved using it. now he can carry out simple conversation with spanish speakers without nervousness. i think it is worth the money and time.
rosettastone,5,16,"the webster is super user friendly and the pp even more so. it's great because i always have my phone with me, so i can essentially practice daytime anywhere. i can pick up where i've left off and that's what i enjoy the most. i recently completed lesson 1 unit 1 with 98% accuracy and the pp recommended i retro for 100%. i was reluctant to do so because i thought i'd have to start the entire unit. hope! the program is intuition and only repeated what needed correcting. super cool."
rosettastone,5,0,having am amazing time learning the basis. 🙂
rosettastone,5,0,"this pp has helped me learn so much in such little time, at first it's confusing but when you get the hang of it, it's amazing."
rosettastone,5,5,"i enjoy the experience of learning languages with roseola stone. it is both fun and engaging and really helps to get an intuition understanding of the language. i somewhat wish there was more extended learning stories or other activities but it is still a five star pp. also, i wish there was a recommendation of what to learn outside of roseola stone for after the program is finished and additional learning while doing the roseola stone course"
rosettastone,5,0,great pp! i've been using roseola stone to re-learn french and i've received many compliments on my progress from my french colleagues in just 6 weeks. the 30 minutes a day lessons fit easily into my schedule and build on prior lessons. comprehension is based on cognitive recognition and repetition. would highly recommend roseola stone to anyone who wants to learn a new language.
rosettastone,5,22,"best language pp i've ever used! the pp layout is super easy to navigable. the lessons are challenging (in a good way!) and actually help you grow your comprehension better than just throwing vocal at you. the high yes pictures are pretty but also very helpful. i like that the pp sends modifications to remind you to practice, though i haven't needed one lately! i'm on a 5 day streak :)"
rosettastone,5,1,"for those seeking to efficiently and effectively learn from a selection of 24 languages, this pp is worth the price. download it for free and go through the core lesson in unit 1 for however many, even all, of the 24 languages -- that should be enough to give you an idea of what the pp is like and if it's a good fit for you."
rosettastone,5,0,very easy to use and love the format for my tablet and phone. it works better than it did on my computer so i am actually using the software more than i used to.
rosettastone,5,0,i love this pp and want to share it with my son
rosettastone,5,0,just wish it had a pay monthly option. i don't have a spare £190 blowing about..
rosettastone,5,2,"i am enjoying the lessons. i have 2 issues. (1) sometimes i do not know why one tense or form of a word is correct. i get the answers right but dont always know why. (2) it's a little disappointing that this pp doesn son across devices. i am studying a new language on my smart phone, tablet and lawton. very often when i come to the pp it has me on the wrong lesson because it doesn son up."
rosettastone,5,1,i was using domingo for awhile but i think roseola stone has been helping a lot more. the recording are a lot sharper and i can understand the pronunciation a lot more. i also love all of the different option of practicing such as the core lessons and reading books! i practice on my phone all the time. i think the microphone can understand my speaking a lot more than other apes. i highly recommend trying roseola stone!
rosettastone,5,1,"i usually have a hard time learning languages with learning apes, because they don't teach you how to correctly pronunciate the word. i don't feel confident saying the word if i'm not sure about how to pronounce it, in this one they do. what i love about this pp is, instead of saying it in in english and then saying it in another language they only teach you in that language that's not hard to have pictures and it makes everything easier for my brain to connect the two languages."
rosettastone,5,18,"i'm learning japanese. this really reaches clot! if you pay attention, you not only learn vocabulary, but you also learn sentence structure and verb conjugations, as well as kann & anti. i recommend this... you would also want to buy language books, use free online sources, and i also recommend using pimsleur as well. roseola stone + pimsleur are powerful learning tools if you honestly want to learn a foreign language. roseola stone for visual & vocabulary, and pimsleur for in-depth audit."
rosettastone,5,0,pretty cool! i love doing the lessons on my phone.
rosettastone,5,117,"i have used roseola stone (european spanish) for two months now and am fully satisfied. i really learn a lot. the immersion learning method is fun, fascinating, and works. you start with very easy lessons with very short sentences, backed by textbook-like photographs. the further you advance, the more you encounter phrases that could well be used in real life situations. sometimes the pp behaves weird, but this can be resolved by closing and launching it again."
rosettastone,5,1,"i am using this pp to learn chinese, and so far it is proving exceedingly useful and very fun. the only negative thing about it for me personally, is that you don't get very many lessons for free. another thing i am personally having problems with, is my microphone. sometimes it won't hear me, and i end up shipping it because i can't figure out why it won't work. (but for some reason this only happens with particular words) other than that, i highly recommend it! ❤"
rosettastone,5,0,very hard but rewarding
rosettastone,5,165,"update after a 3 months of use: this is the best pp i've ever come across for learning a different language. it's immersion and intuition and i will most certainly be continuing with my subscription. i've found one they flaw - and that is you need total silence for verbal exercise, if there a sire in the distance or even if you have your to on low, it struggles to differentiate. that's just nitpicking though. 10/10"
rosettastone,5,7,"only a few days in and i feel comfortable talking about my surroundings out loud due to the pp getting you to speak right from the beginning. for a light or timid user roseola stone might feel like a bit of a leap, but it is more applied than the three other language learning apes i use and has you thinking about the content from different angles, leaving you more confident about using the content with greater fluidity. still working on my is. recommended."
rosettastone,5,4,"short version (with no story) it's good and repetition with several learning style by making you speak, look and listen to the words and grammar. but does not offer an english version for some obscure words that you may never find in the picture that is associated with the words. like looking at a cats eye up close, is this a cat or an eye, kind confusing sometimes but would still highly recommend to beginning to learn a new language."
rosettastone,5,27,"this is the most fun pp i have ever used for language learning. and i have used many. it doesn't rely on grammar and spelling memorisation like so many apes do which can make the process of learning boring and frustration, and makes you not actually acquire the language in the most intuition, immersion and natural way possible. roseola stone is different as it does not make you translate anything, so you end up thinking in the target language, which leads to fleecy much faster. do recommend."
rosettastone,5,8,"i enjoy learning with roseola stone. it works as intended: teaching through repetition and memorization. it does this thou audit, visual, and voice recognition aids. language learning is best done thou immersion, and this is as close as you can get without being in the native country. the price is worth it if you are putting in the time required to learn. if you use it once a week, it's not worth it. if you use it several times a day, it is. it's great for the hard-working learner."
rosettastone,5,0,very well-designed. roseola stone makes it easier to progress then any other program i have seen.
rosettastone,5,0,"really have appreciated the pp... although, the link to subscribe isn't allowing to cancel my subscription..."
rosettastone,5,0,the best language learning pp i ever used.
rosettastone,5,0,"the pp itself: great! great design, great i, simple, easy to use, intuition; 5 stars. the program itself: so years ago give tried to learn a language from scratch using only is and i initially liked it, but once progressing to higher levels &abstract concepts, i was just frustrated& didn't understand anything. that being said, i love is now for the practice &especially speaking/pronunciation! using a different tool to ""learn""& this for speaking, extra review& immersion time works great for me"
rosettastone,5,0,i love it. i can surely learn japanese with this pp. i dont know about the other languages but i'm sure they are just as easy to learn. i can't wait until in older and i can go to japan but for now ill just stick to learning japanese. i definitely recommend this pp to all people wanting to learn a different language.
rosettastone,5,0,"this pp is amazing. i always complain about language learning apes not doing it right, translating directly from english without taking into account that sometimes the language has words that can't be translated and that it can make things harder to understand, the way this pp reaches gives you a fresh start like you would a child, and it helps you with your pronunciation. this is the best language pp i have ever used."
rosettastone,5,3,"the best pp for learning languages that i've ever used. i tried domingo before and it's not nearly as good as this. however, domingo is free, so it might not be a fair comparison. best thing about roseola stone is that it reaches you a language in that language through pictures and context, instead of translating from another language. highly recommended, but bear in mind that to see any results, you have to invest quite significant amount of time (at least 50 hours)"
rosettastone,5,3,"i love this program! if i could ask for anything, it would be that for a language with a different alphabet, there be a little more rep work allowed on sounding out words. 5 syllable words in greek are more than a little difficult when you're still trying to learn what sounds the letters make."
rosettastone,5,4,"i noticed that it starts out with some intermediate spanish being that i used to speak bluntly that part i don't understand. however, this program is wonderful is very interactive in the psychological aspect of getting your brain to reinforce and remember the words. it's all about repetition!!!"
rosettastone,5,16,"well this is fun! it.s nice that it also has pictures that really help usually as well which really helps with the visual memory. but of course we need to buy it to get better access. what i found weird was the fact that it started with phrases directly and the writing is in greek, so if you have no idea regarding the greek alphabet, that's donna be tricky. good thing i already know some greek and everything doesn't seem that overwhelming 😉 looking forward to explore more"
rosettastone,5,2,"i have found it helps me, and my poor memory, to write things down along with frantic sounds, as i go along. i am also re-doing each lesson to help it become embedded, hopefully. the pp is great and provides different parts for listening, speaking and recognition. enjoying it so far."
rosettastone,5,0,"love it! been learning and teaching myself for about 2 weeks now. i am busy so i am glad i can do it on my own time everyday. it reaches you a lot and gives you the option to put the english translation if you want it. it's not just about listening and learning, you have to speak it and learn it, plus learn to write it as well."
rosettastone,5,5,"j'accuse the pp, mais it's right. ll. i have my and language proficient in french, but for certain words it kept x'ing me. after multiple failed attempts, changing the voice recognition (still x), pronunciation difficulty (still x), it was my speed (correct! my speech was just too elongated). i *wish* the pp had given clues, because i was getting' real t.o.'ed at the pp. however, for not being a live human, this root does remarkable well and my confidence in the grammar's improving too!"
rosettastone,5,9,"having a great time learning japanese. reading through the comments, i see that a lot of the negative feedback has to do with roseola stone's approach, which people should be aware of. it's meant to be immersion. as a result, none of your instruction is presented to you in your native language. this can be frustration for some i'm sure, but i find it a better way to learn, as it forces you to think in the language from the start."
rosettastone,5,0,great pp to learn new languages
rosettastone,5,61,"this pp is great for learning a language, fast. dont worry if you dont know what a phrase means, just hold down on the phrase or picture, and press see translation, it's as easy as that. i would highly recommend this pp to a friend, or family. there are different categories that you can choose from for what kinds of words/phrases you want to learn. you can learn so many words in such a small amount of time. thanks roseola stone for helping me to learn italian everyday."
rosettastone,5,2,"very effective in teaching pronunciation. the word teaching, however, is a bit slow. the pp can be more effective by teaching more words instead of having the user go through some of the exercises over too frequently. there are just two flaws. the pp wants you to repeat the syllables, the voice pronounced syllables as it is spoken but the pp shows the word break down. voice pronounced 머 거 요, pp shows 먹 어 요. the other issue is that it didn't teach the alphabet or pronunciation rules."
rosettastone,5,1,"really good for getting you speaking the language and recognizing characters. core lessons go a little fast but smaller specific lessons let you practice things like pronunciation of the syllables. i like that it tells you of you are pronouncing something wrong. if my opinion changes with further use, i'll update this rating."
rosettastone,5,0,"far learning tool, easy to use"
rosettastone,5,0,awesome format! using with my son
rosettastone,5,0,it more helpful than domingo... surprisingly.
rosettastone,5,0,"excellent feedback, easy to follow and recall."
rosettastone,5,13,"i love this pp so much, it helps so much with pronunciation and listening exercises. plus the fun watching activities are slightly admitting. i purchased the organ course (which is wonderful) but it may be hard for total beginners. you should probably get more familiar with the angel alphabet before subscribing to this course."
rosettastone,5,0,"really great when haired with other learning programs/books/material. the audit is great to listen to in the car on the way to work for extra listening comprehension work! the speaking part is sometimes a little buggy, but overall i'm happy with this pp!"
rosettastone,5,0,"looks expensive but well worth the money. started with domingo which is great given it is free, but pleased i invested in is. it takes learning a language to another level and is fun. is has clearly invested a lot of time and money in developing the pp."
rosettastone,5,1,"there is only pictures and japanese words, no english (other then in menu) which i get since some words can't be translated into english but i wasn't used to this learning style so it took a few tries to get used to it, now i'm learning at a steady pace"
rosettastone,5,1,"so far very useful. picking it up fast, not 100% sure if it's their methods or if it's a childhood where i was, when younger, made to speak more then english for a while (not that the german or french stuck around long, with where i live) but linguistic seem to trigger something fun in my head."
rosettastone,5,3,"i absolutely love roseola stone. i think it's the best way to learn. it's immersion and doesn't really let you translate, so it makes actual speaking and understanding much easier. i've not only gotten better at my target languages but i also have more confidence in speaking them."
rosettastone,5,0,"its very information, easy, and is helping me clot. i feel like in no time i will be speaking client spanish!"
rosettastone,5,0,awesome learning tool
rosettastone,5,0,"great pp. haven't gotten very far into it yet, but i'm already learning so much. instead of learning to translate it over to my first language which is english, i learned to associate the language that i'm learning with pictures. that way i can division it in my head instead of having to translate it over first"
rosettastone,5,1,"i'm really enjoying learning spanish with roseola stone. it's super helpful that i can switch between my computer and my tablet, depending on what is most convenient. it allows you to develop all 4 of the key skill; listening, speaking, reading, & writing. love it! love it!"
rosettastone,5,0,a great way to learn to speak a new language. this pp guides you from the basis to the advanced. it even helps you develop the proper accent and pronunciation of the language of choice. i've learned more in an hour with this pp then i have ever learned from the other apes i have tried. this is definitely worth 5 stars and i highly recommend giving it a try.
rosettastone,5,0,"there are some i elements i am critical of in the pp, such as having the play button to hear the option with a smaller live area than the button it's within (leaving little room for failure). however, the content is fantastic and a great way to learn."
rosettastone,5,0,super effective and a nice pp in general
rosettastone,5,0,great way to sharpen skill.
rosettastone,5,0,so far so good. easy to use
rosettastone,5,0,outstanding method of learning
rosettastone,5,0,was not so hard a little issue with my pronunciation
rosettastone,5,19,it has a very good balance of vocabulary training and pronunciation training. it also reaches you about the grammar which a lot of foreign language apes lack. it doesn't really let you go too fast either. it really makes sure you understand before going on to the next lesson. definitely recommend!!!
rosettastone,5,1,"if you don't mind paying, this a has the best learning outside of complete immersion. you attach sounds with images and ideas, not to english words. it tests your pronunciation. the written word is not for beginners, though. you may need another a to learn angel letters, chinese or japanese."
rosettastone,5,0,"this pp is really helpful. i never get bored learning english because of its fantastic and modern methods. when you start using it, you can obviously see how much effort they have put to it so users will enjoy and learn at the same time. happy to had come across such an amazing pp."
rosettastone,5,0,"simple and fun, great pp"
rosettastone,5,2,good method and format. i like that you can pause the exercises now. i had a lot of success using this to learn german while stationed in germany while in the army. i'm working on spanish now. it wont make you client but it gives you a great start. you can certainly carry a conversation by the time you finish.
rosettastone,5,4,"having tried memories and domingo, i find that this is by far the most in depth and consistent teacher of another language. i would like it to continue on beyond where it finished and would like the questions to be more randomised and call back to previously learnt topics, but it still managed to be the best."
rosettastone,5,2,i purchased the d version of tagalog (filipino) 12 years ago and it has been sitting on the shelf for the last 10 years. i recently decided to pull it back out to try and learn more before another trip to the philippines only to discover there is no d drive in my lawton. i decided to purchase the online subscription and i love it. the method of learning is the same but greatly improved interaction with the pp. i am thrilled to be able to use it on multiple devices too.
rosettastone,5,3,absolutely love the speech and communication breakdown technology and visual association! each lesson is broken down to help improve pronunciation and build confidence speaking and perfecting tone and patience.  such neat educational technology development that is organized and super effective in producing results!
rosettastone,5,0,easy to use and fun
rosettastone,5,0,good pp but expensive
rosettastone,5,13,"loved the pp because it actually reaches you the basis and how to pronounce the words correctly. i've been wanting to learn italian for some time now and this pp is the best, better than domingo, and it has languages that other apes normally don't have, so that's cool too"
rosettastone,5,1,"the system is really effective because it allows your mind to associate words with images, not their english translations. this prevents you from getting caught up trying to think of what you want to say in english and translating it, and instead allowing you to think of the language directly"
rosettastone,5,3,"i usually use the lawton version because i think this method gets more effective by seeing larger picture and in a quiet room. however, for the use of the audit clips on the way, the pp version is useful. thanks for the steady updated."
rosettastone,5,0,"i really like the fact that phrases, sentences, words are not translated into a language that i understand. just a combination of picture and words and there you have it. great approach to learning a language! not to mention the convenience of having the pp with me wherever i go..."
rosettastone,5,0,i really enjoyed learning japanese here. it's more like a project based learning method than normal methods learning from recognizing the alphabet. i think it will be more efficient for one to master a language. good luck.
rosettastone,5,2,great..easy to use..very information.its clot like having you own personal utter with you whenever you need them..its one on one so you have the program all to yourself.i feel like his is the beat and easiest way to learn a new language..you get to learn at your pace so you dont have to rush through the lessons. no language is available to be learned.its cheap so anyone can afford it and if there something you need to focus on in general then its not a problem.you can always fresh up
rosettastone,5,0,absolutely incredible. you will surprise yourself with how fast and quick you will learn the basis of the language. spanish in my case. the structure of the learning process is done in a unique way. you will cruise fearlessly throughout the learning units.
rosettastone,5,0,great pp! love the easy steps and great ways to learn a new language.
rosettastone,5,0,"in short, the best of them all! i've used most of all the other apes but none of them can be compared to even the half of roseola stone."
rosettastone,5,0,it's awesome but need some feature..
rosettastone,5,0,"good , but only one lesson."
rosettastone,5,11,"i love rosettastone, i learned a lot and is fun. i recommend it to everyone. i have also taken the tutoring class and i been able to understand an answer all of my tutor's questions. the only thing i think they could improve is the ""microphone"" on the pp, sometimes it makes me repeat and marks the pronunciation wrong while on the webster marks it right"
rosettastone,5,1,"i've had a blast learning makarin chinese. in my experience so far, roseola stone is best for asia languages because they don't do english association. english association can be confusing with asia languages because they're so different. that is my experience at least. your brain learns it as though you you were fully immersed in the country. the fee is a small price to pay for the amount of content you get access to."
rosettastone,5,0,i enjoyed learning with this pp. it's very simple how it starts and you can learn fast.
rosettastone,5,0,i love the images tied to words whilst pronouncing it all together. it flows very well.
rosettastone,5,0,lots of fun...
rosettastone,5,0,"i started using roseola stone to learn spanish, then tried some of the other apes that are free out there, however i've come back to roseola stone, for the minimal price that it is, it definitely reaches you a new language far better. it has a better more enduring structure. money well spent, it's don't again!"
rosettastone,5,0,"roseola stone has made learning on my own schedule easy and in all honesty unfordable. they teach you like you are a child and immense you in the language. you will learn at a natural pace and be able to put pictures to words and be able to pick out the ones you have learned quickly, while implementing them in sentences. getting the lifetime membership is worth the price. unlimited languages at your fingertips."
rosettastone,5,0,"surprised and relieved! no translations to feel bad about when forgotten. just started using this pp for makarin at a beginner's level. i'm just so relieved i've got a chance to put aside brute memorization technique and learn through a process of, what i'd like to say, elimination and revelation."
rosettastone,5,0,"i have utilized several, at least 5 different methods to learn hebrew, including those with personal teacher interaction -- as well as having researches over a dozen other methods before purchasing; yet, i have found roseola stone incredibly far more effective than any other method -- also, though i've formally studied both spanish & russian, hebrew is not an easy language for an american to learn, i have been surprised at how well through roseola stone that in a short time i've already..."
rosettastone,5,0,fun! the way every letter or syllable is pronounced is different than english. its fun to try to pronounce the words even if my southern accent makes it a little off. i love it when i get it right.
rosettastone,5,0,"the speaking is new from when i owned it last. very very helpful! i am a big fan and am learning more and more quickly than the last time i had the software. be prepared to sound a bit silly at first, maybe do it alone. ll"
rosettastone,5,162,"i studied german in the past and was able to use up to unit 9 in review. for me this is a great resource. however, i would suggest a basic background in german if you have never studied before. the noun declaration, propositions, sentence structures and verb congregations can be confusing to a novice."
rosettastone,5,0,"this program is easy to use. various features help not only learning to read and write, but to speak properly."
rosettastone,5,0,great if you want an easy way to learn the pp is what you are looking for. so easy to pull out my phone and start learning. thank you
rosettastone,5,0,it is best pp to learn english
rosettastone,5,285,super easy! i'm learning a new language in 30 minutes a day. comes with an optional audit portion i play in the car to reinforce my lesson. pay is so reasonable...i will have paid about $200 total to learn a new language. way less than a class or tutor would have cost and i get to take my lessons whenever i please!
rosettastone,5,16,"i've been trying to learn japanese for a little over a year. i've recently started using this pp for it and i have never had this much success with other apes. and it's easier to immense myself in the language because it doesn't give you english translation, just photo. i love it and will continue to use it."
rosettastone,5,5,"absolutely love roseola stone! they've never failed me when it came to language learning. i tried three other apes before installing roseola, and i should have known to install roseola first. ありがとうございます! dance scene! much gracious! i just wish it wasn't so expensive, but it is totally worth the money. i suggest buying the desktop d-from to avoid the yearly subscription."
rosettastone,5,0,super fun way to learn a new language. feels like gazing! starts off easy to promote a sense of self-efficacy (and provide an ego boost 😊) and progressively becomes more challenging. loving it! 👍
rosettastone,5,10,"incredible! i can't believe how natural and quick this pp makes learning organ! i am an english-spanish lingual and have never spoken or learned organ before, except for watching a few couture vocal video . the roseola stone module gets it right. couture vocabulary tutorials just doesn't compare! and so unfordable!"
rosettastone,5,0,"this pp is the best for learning languages, and especially better than the monday (s?) pp. it works intuitively and functions perfectly. super easy to use with no fuss whatsoever and i have already begun to think in spanish! i highly recommend this without reservation."
rosettastone,5,2,i love this pp !! having visited the netherlands me and my partner decided our retirement plan is to move there as we don't speak dutch i decided to learn first in most other languages i'm regarded as having a speech impediment making it hard to learn this pp actually recognises that and still tells me that i would be understood in the netherlands i'm looking forward to testing out a little bit of my dutch when i go for the next visit and hoping the eventually i'll pick it up and be client
rosettastone,5,1,liking it so far. the immersion approach i think is good for me. used many learning tools before but this is supposed to be the one that should do the trick. have the two year subscription.
rosettastone,5,3,building my language skill with this pp is a great way to improve my speaking ability. i've been using another pp for several years and i have a good handle on the language and using this is increasing my confidence in speaking with a native speaker. i really like it.
rosettastone,5,0,"pretty awesome if you'd ask me. was shocked just how well the phone pp worked compared to my other devices. right off the back i decided this was the right choice for me. there are a bunch of free apes, but you really get your money's worth, learning with roseola."
rosettastone,5,0,really helps me stay sharp.
rosettastone,5,0,roseola stone is one of the best apes to learn english.
rosettastone,5,0,everything is perfect i just installed it and i am amazed
rosettastone,5,0,very educational and easy to learn the basis can't wait to learn more thank you roseola stone.
rosettastone,5,0,"i've only done one lesson, but i found it so useful! i know lots of words/sentences. i can say them. work sentences out if i don't know the words. it will give me an image and i can say it in french. this is only after half an hour!"
rosettastone,5,2,this pp is amazing to use for classes or just in general ( like trying new languages). the only thing i do recommend is when they ask you to say that word make sure your in a quite place because you will be marked wrong if they don't understand you.😂
rosettastone,5,11,"i have been using rossesta stone on and off for about seven years and i find their system to be relaxing and helpful. i have struggled in language courses in school but the ossea stone approach has boasted my confidence! i use it for free through my local library. unfortunately the pp doesn't allow you to complete milestones like you can on the desktop version, and some of the pictures are difficult to see on my phone screen. maybe if the borders between the pictures were smaller it would help"
rosettastone,5,9,"roseola stone provides the best service ever. they do all the work for you, just sit back and learn! the learning process is not overwhelming with complexities yet very reasonable with advances in the target language. you are missing out big time if you dont try this. simply incredible!"
rosettastone,5,1,"it's fun to use and the lessons are varied so that they're not repetition. overall, i enjoy learning through the pp and look forward to the lessons. i appreciate the different levels of language learning and the increase in difficulty as you continue."
rosettastone,5,4,"this is more if a refreshed for me, just started using this pp and so far i like it a lot. want to be client in speaking spanish and so far i think this will be able to help in me being able to have everyday conversations with people and getting a better grasp with certain words."
rosettastone,5,0,one of the best pp to learn any language
rosettastone,5,0,easy and fast!
rosettastone,5,0,really good and help me learn as much as possible
rosettastone,5,0,best for learning new language
rosettastone,5,1,i love the full immersion program. there is no english and n as to disrupt learning. it’s multisensory and intuition because its experencial. that makes it perfect for very type of learner. it makes learning fun and rewarding. i find i want to practice every day!
rosettastone,5,0,i love the pp on my phone because during the to commercial in the evening i turn down the volume and practice my spanish. it's so convenient and easy to fit into my schedule without having to schedule it.
rosettastone,5,0,"haven't paid for full version yet, but so far so good. you can choose what lessons you do, so jump between basic and more advanced which is really important cos i already have some spanish and get really bored starting at the beginning again, but need reminders sometimes too"
rosettastone,5,0,"great pp. no as, no lagging. very well designed! the immersion technology is defeated. and it's teaching an old dog new tricks so that's a plus. enjoying learning a new language."
rosettastone,5,2,"roseola stone's voice recognition could use improvement, but other than that the program seems pretty good. the pp itself is nice! it's smooth and responsive. looks good too."
rosettastone,5,0,easy to learn and fun
rosettastone,5,0,it would be better if it was for free
rosettastone,5,0,very natural and immersion
rosettastone,5,0,very helpful and useful. i use it along with formal class setting. helps with grammar and speech. learning tools extremely helpful with speaking !!love being able to review at any time or place.
rosettastone,5,2,i didn't think paying for roseola stone would be worth it but since i wasn't advancing much in russian with other apes i thought i'd give it a try especially because there was a sale for a 6 months package. after just a few days i can form sentences now in russian so it must be working. but the program is still too expensive.
rosettastone,5,4,"the only issue i have had is background noise affects how well it years and rates your pronunciation. otherwise, it has been very helpful fir keeping up on my practice, and since with my computer account!"
rosettastone,5,0,very was to use. i am already learning how to speak my picked (spanish) language. i started of not paying for it then loved it so much i had to. i am now really good at speaking spanish. i highly recommend. if your thinking about it and reading this i can tell you it is worth it !!!
rosettastone,5,3,i have just startedvusing it and i like it a lot. my only complain is that in the scenario that the learner is requested to pick one out of three icons the icons are very small and sometimes i miss because i can't see their content
rosettastone,5,0,"simulates learning language the way you would in real world immersion, by showing you stuff and letting you figure it out instead of teaching grammar etc. works well and keeps me engaged, but not sure how long i will retain the information this way."
rosettastone,5,11,"carefully built up learning program, addressing different components (vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation); plenty of possibilities to practice; direct feedback during exercises; and a good balance between double and challenging. stays interesting and dynamic."
rosettastone,5,3,different voice tones. male and female voices. trial is a good amount of time. accent recognition is decent. breaks down into masculine and feminine as well as plural and singular in first courses.
rosettastone,5,0,i just started and really love it. hoping to surprise everyone by christmas.
rosettastone,5,0,"the pp is quite easy to use. the audit is easy to hear and the pronunciation can be well heard. if you mess up on a section, you can easily go back and review and it has good prompt."
rosettastone,5,11,"i love it...i wish it was free...i thought it was, only to find out the pp i download is for a ""trial period"". i'm very disappointed...but wish i could afford the 'whole pp'. i think i would do well, if i could afford the whole course, i would try other languages as well. i was excited when i thought it was for free :,("
rosettastone,5,0,"i really like this pp! i'm learning japanese and it helps me with grammar, letters, and pronunciation. they even have stories to read, all without being on the premium version!"
rosettastone,5,173,"i think having the pp on my phone is going to make practicing much more convenient! the mid pick up my voice well and i like that the pages don't advance automatically, so i have time to go back and pronounce phrases again, even if i got it right."
rosettastone,5,1,works great. really helpful application. i have not purchased the lessons. i just started to work through the free course. suggest a really quiet place with a good microphone.
rosettastone,5,0,"this is a good way to learn. i don't have much complaint, only advice. jump in. if you think you aren't getting it at first, just keep going. you'll get there eventually. you can repeat as much as you want on each lesson, so go back over things you dont feel 100% about"
rosettastone,5,1,i like the way it reaches you words and how to put words in a sentence to use in an actual conversation. instead of translating directly to your own language it shows pictures explaining what the word or phrase means would you can figure it out yourself.
rosettastone,5,1,one of the best pp for learning german especially for one without any previous knowledge (a). this pp is a must have if you have interest to learn and speak dutch. it has help me improve my german. i wish you guns will add some tips about oral practice especially for a exam.
rosettastone,5,0,roseola stone makes it very easy to learn a new language
rosettastone,5,0,so good. i love that it records and grades your pronunciation!!
rosettastone,5,1,learning anything new is a challenge.i decided on japanese because i enjoy aime.the brain must be getting a lookout having to make new connections to new symbols and sounds not to mention word structure.the learning is as easy or hard as you desire.and you can always go back and repeat a level to increase your confidence.a few minutes a day it feels good to learn.
rosettastone,5,4,"roseola stone has helped me reach a proficient level in spanish. additional, i am on my way to a good understanding of german. although i also use free apes to learn languages, i feel i have gotten the most out of roseola stone. the lessons are sequential and practical. you learn useful phrases that you actually hear and say when you visit another country. it is worth the investment if you really want to learn a language."
rosettastone,5,0,"i love this pp! its helped learn a lot of organ! one thing i would add is, how to read it first, because if you're a beginner like me, it will be difficult at first. (love the pp the)"
rosettastone,5,0,used is for spanish on the pp years ago. loved it. this pp works really well. i just wish they had kept the ability to purchase the software for the pp straight out or reduce the monthly rates. i feel they have prices themselves at a point where cheaper cold cat software will move in.
rosettastone,5,0,"i have been utilizing roseola stone's language courses since they used the old d from versions. if you want to learn a language without being in a formal classroom setting i feel they definitely are #1! i took three years of college japanese and i could speak and understand after completing roseola stone's level two latin american spanish course! the ability to comprehend the language is as close as you can get, short of living abroad. in my honest opinion, there is no better choice!"
rosettastone,5,0,super easy to use.
rosettastone,5,0,i love and then check with goose translate .
rosettastone,5,0,free trial is worth it!!!
rosettastone,5,0,"hi i'm a student in secondary school who is taking a gase in french and i was seeking some tutoring type help to improve as i was struggling and not as good as i would have liked to be. roseola stones has really improved my french and i feel more confident than ever in french. the tutoring sessions are ideal if your wondering and is definitely worth the money. you get around 10 sessions per month of 25 minutes of each, and you can choose the time that you need with extra nice tutors."
rosettastone,5,4,"love it! you can learn anywhere. i have noticed that i am saying small phrases in my head when doing certain tasks. many times, i will say them out loud if at home."
rosettastone,5,1,"i love this pp! very convenient and easy to use. the visual help me to remember what give learned, especially understanding conjugations. that has always been the hardest for me when trying to learn a language!"
rosettastone,5,1,"i took two years of spanish and in two years we sang a lot of songs did vocabulary worksheets and played liberia, and i learned zero spanish. i've been using this pp for about min and it has been fun fast paced without being overwhelming and i can honestly say in less than an hour with ossea stone on the free trial i have learned more spanish than in two years in my high school. bravo all, i'm finally learning a second language."
rosettastone,5,9,excellent and straightforward. no english from day one - just the new language. several things are very specific and in depth; this is more detailed and better planned out/set up than duolinguo or other apes i tried. worth every penny.
rosettastone,5,0,"this has been a wonderful tool; every lesson is brilliant on it's own; with continuous introduction of past lessons along the way, it quickly build vocabulary and conversation skill!"
rosettastone,5,0,"really great, thoughtful highest quality content - better than do lingo, which is good too. really better for listening and speaking skill, harder work for more serious students but much better progress and understanding"
rosettastone,5,0,i've tried other ways to learn another language and this one really is the best way to learn i grasped it way sooner
rosettastone,5,162,"i've been learning languages my whole life, and this pp makes learning a new language (or practicing a previously learned one) easy, fun, and manageable time-wise. learning languages as an adult is harder than when i was a kid, but rose stone helps me learn faster and its pp makes it easier to manage with a busy schedule."
rosettastone,5,3,works well. it took a min to work out that i had to wipe right to get to the next screen which is good because my old desktop version used to move on without letting me review. speech recognize works fine on my bluetooth heads.
rosettastone,5,1,love the pp. best pp i have found with helping out pronunciation of words. clearly spoken and easy to follow. really helps and worth trying in my opinion. just wish it offered belaya. thank you though great pp.
rosettastone,5,0,"it is immersion based, so you might find it confusing at first. but if you give it some time, you will see the patterns in the words, and that will help you learn and remember better."
rosettastone,5,2,throws you into a language quickly and efficiently . i like how it uses pictures without your native language so you agent constantly translating back and forth. it is a very well designed pp.
rosettastone,5,0,a pleasure to use. well paced and natural to follow.
rosettastone,5,0,i love roseola stone. i used it before it was on the phone just on computer.i had helped a lot of people coming from mexico to learn english to pass they're citizenship. is the number one best language learning application software that i have ever seen.
rosettastone,5,0,i've been able to speak more german with the help of roseola stone then from my years of college german classes.
rosettastone,5,0,fun and it really helps
rosettastone,5,0,"love it so far, although the prices in my opinion could be lowered"
rosettastone,5,0,"not a cheap subscription, but by far the best i've used, it makes language fun to learn and is excellent for people who start from scratch. well worth the money in my opinion!"
rosettastone,5,7,"amazing, it tells you how close you were and even walks you through it. this is the most helpful language learning pp i have ever used, it even helps more than the language learning video on couture."
rosettastone,5,0,"this is definitely a well constructed learning program. it is easy to follow and understand. especially in this format. visual, audit, and great pronunciation makes it easier to learn. i wish they had this when i was in school!"
rosettastone,5,3,"i love being able to learn at my pace on my phone! it does require a good internet connection, but being able to steadily keep learning while anywhere in the house with the babies has helped a lot!"
rosettastone,5,0,"relaxing. i especially appreciate the pictures, and the time and energy that went into picking them!"
rosettastone,5,0,this pp makes learning french easy and fun. i love that it rates pronunciation with colors. i always know what i need to practice. this reaches so that adults who are definitely not linguistic can learn any language. arabic next...😀
rosettastone,5,0,i learn so much with this program. i don't think i could become client with it though. but very educational.
rosettastone,5,0,"first session has already taught me a lot. i can't wait to see, hear, speak and learn more!"
rosettastone,5,0,roseola stone is helpful with pronunciation and sentence structure and is great practice overall! i am trying to learn the native language of my labmates (russian) and so i can use the pp at home and get the intonation right and then talk to them once i'm in lab.
rosettastone,5,0,"i really like the pp. just a couple of questions, tagalog doesn't seem to have the phrase book that i can see other languages have? and i was wondering if the games you have on the webster will be added to the apes at any point?"
rosettastone,5,2,this is really helping me learn japanese. everything thing though like even the pronunciation. highly recommend. definitely worth the money if you're planning on traveling.
rosettastone,5,0,i enjoy the roseola stone learning method. it's often difficult to learn some of the words using the context of pictures only. i suggest you keep a dictionary handy and other grammar helps close by. i'm enjoying learning irish.
rosettastone,5,0,"great learning pp, only issue i have which is really annoying is when you finish a section and it says you didn. so you do it again just to move on but it still says you didn do it."
rosettastone,5,0,this program is very intuition and efficient! the recommended half-hour daily practice session just flies by! i highly suggest using this pp if you're looking for a fast-track route to speaking any language.
rosettastone,5,0,i'm a language teacher and i really approve of the concept of full immersion. it might take a little more to grasp the meaning of words but surely makes you learn faster in the long run.
rosettastone,5,0,"good companion to the online series. my lawton doesn't always son with the headphones, so i use this. sometimes it doesn't hear me, but i am using it more than i anticipated."
rosettastone,5,0,in enjoying it. the mouth movements and rolling r's are different than in used to. i usually gargle r's.
rosettastone,5,0,this is a great way to learn new languages
rosettastone,5,2,it makes learning a different language easy! learning the basis and then learning how to pronounce the words makes it easier to work it into sentences! ill be buying the full package shortly to utilize all of the languages available!!
rosettastone,5,0,"i really like this. it's great to be able to learn with my phone. i have the d from version but never have a chance to use it. but with it on my phone, now i can learn about anywhere. good stuff. thank you."
rosettastone,5,0,it immersed you in the language your choosing. match pictures to phrases. the only downside is that it doesn't give you a clear definition of what your learning.
rosettastone,5,1,"this pp is a good way to keep up with your language learning on the go. make sure your phone doesn't have a rotation lock installed (or set it to stock auto for this pp), since the venus are in portrait and the lessons are in landscape."
rosettastone,5,0,"great pp, there is no way you can't learn!"
rosettastone,5,0,i need to give it 5 stars to complete a survey for an phone 11 pro so yeah but it's good in.
rosettastone,5,0,"mostly works great, the keyboard on brother edition could use some way better singing and a little less strictness on writing lessons. mid sometimes breaks as well but that okay. very fun and intuition."
rosettastone,5,3,"i've used a few different sites and apes to learn organ and this is by far the best. definitely getting the year subscription! i mean, it's cheaper than netflix so why not?!"
rosettastone,5,2,i love how it is challenging. it's a nice contrast to other pp just teaching beginner stuff. wouldn't use this pp by itself though if you are a beginner.
rosettastone,5,0,great so far. love that it makes you associate the words with images and sounds rather than giving you the english. seems a more immersion way to learn
rosettastone,5,0,"although it may seem prices up front, it is an excellent value for a busy person getting in a 20 minute lesson per day during breakfast. commit to at least a year's subscription, and it is pennies a day."
rosettastone,5,4,"is a great learning tool for learning other languages. i usually have a hard time learning, but since i started using roseola it has been a lot easier. i'm slow at learning, and am able to go at my own pace. love all the features."
rosettastone,5,3,great pp. i'm learning faster than i ever have on other language apes. i'm not too far in but i feel like my brain is already trying to translate and remember the stuff i'm learning.
rosettastone,5,0,i learning tagalog or filipino and it good. my friend is from the philippines and now i can talk to her in tagalog. umiinom and ma eating babe means the girls are drinking.
rosettastone,5,0,its really easy to work with
rosettastone,5,0,reaches characters also
rosettastone,5,0,i like that there is only the language that you learn with the pictures in the lessons. i also like the audit which reinforced the pronunciation of all sentences that i come across
rosettastone,5,0,very convenient and easy to use on my phone (motor ze). makes it interactive and fun to use. i can use it anywhere when it's convenient for me.
rosettastone,5,0,my one grip is that. *since i use it for japanese along with other places* it shows the text in hiraganna. but moment tell me what a translation is. in the beginning it should tell you. then stop telling you after a few tries.
rosettastone,5,3,this pp is fantastic! i started learning german in highschool and this pp has helped me remember very quickly what i had learned then. the lessons are very clear and easy to follow and even fun!
rosettastone,5,0,"convenient and easy to use, this pp build on what you already know and fills in where your education left off. enjoying all the photography and examples. was able to speak french with students overseas this summer. thanks to roseola stone."
rosettastone,5,1,lessons start simple and camp up gently to more complex conversations and concepts. just the right amount of repetition to give you plenty of chances to absorb the vocabulary. easy to return to previous lessons for review and correction.
rosettastone,5,7,excellent tutoring. helps to understand the grammar and build up strong vocabulary. useful for both beginners and intermediate level students as well. thank you!
rosettastone,5,0,"this pp is really helpful! it's great because it doesn't directly tell you what anything means, it makes you figure it out, so it's resented in your brain."
rosettastone,5,0,really enjoying using this pp. it is helping me learn a lot. however it is not a replacement for speaking the language with a native speaker. that's where you really learn!
rosettastone,5,0,"i love it! i'm learning so much, but i don't like how it needs money to clock the rest of the tasks. other than the in pp purchases, i've learned clot!"
rosettastone,5,0,"it is pretty fun to start learning a language this way! it's no substitute for speaking with native speakers of course, but the ease of getting started can't be denied."
rosettastone,5,0,great pp that helps you learn a second language on the go without needing to translate english into the language you're learning. total immersion that works.
rosettastone,5,0,"the pp works great! the design is relatively easy to navigable, though i do feel the lessons are best used in addition to other sources. still, one of my favorite learning methods."
rosettastone,5,0,roseola stone focused on immersion rather than translation. it's a little longer to get started (and much more expensive) but seems like the best way to learn a tough language. i'm learning organ.
rosettastone,5,2,"good visual learning tools, l like the stories books, it would be an improvement to have an ai communicate back in conversation with different possible variations in that particular language. i give this pp a 5."
rosettastone,5,0,i like being able to use roseola stone anywhere. the pp runs cleanly and is almost more user friendly than the program itself. fantastic use of technology.
rosettastone,5,1,"good speech recognition and lots of practice exercises. love the fact that the basis are free, so you can try before buying. recommend!"
rosettastone,5,0,i really like the immersion style of learning. it's very helpful to hear the phrases and practice speaking. the gradual difficulty makes it fun.
rosettastone,5,0,i love learning from roseola stone. the words are repeated and illustration is given so well i would recommend this to all to give them a try because you will learn something new everyday if you stick to the schedule.
rosettastone,5,0,i love polish...already know the language....but need to practice my denunciation....excellent pp....great learning...fun!!
rosettastone,5,0,great way to learn when a computer is not available.
rosettastone,5,0,"very easy to use interface. i like that you can disabled the speaking, great in instances such as using the pp on the train."
rosettastone,5,1,"roseola stone is so amazing, i have been enjoying brushing up on my spanish with the pp. although, i must say that it is quite advanced, it's not at a beginner's level. so if you have never learned spanish before i suggest you try to learn the basis then maybe try the pp. but i'm sure you could try to learn with the pp as some activities are quite repetition."
rosettastone,5,0,this pp really helps you understand the language and pronounce it correctly at a reasonable pace. i am not far along but am really enjoying it.
rosettastone,5,0,"the pp is just as effective as the computer program. easy to use, very self-explanatory, and fun. there are more lessons available for free than i expected!"
rosettastone,5,0,pronunciation has always been tricky and this approach is very helpful. i'm surprised how quickly i'm catching on to the vocabulary as well. i highly recommend this system.
rosettastone,5,0,"love this pp, it has been extremely helpful to me in learning chinese, it works step by step building confidence along the way in different situations... love it"
rosettastone,5,2,"challenging, but rewarding. i am using this along with other means to learn german, but this is the base of my learning and works well as that. if i had known how well this works with such little time invested each day, i would have been doing this for years."
rosettastone,5,0,"this pp is awesome, i was learning basic phrases and questions within an 90 mind of beginning its easy and you can go at whatever pace is comfortable for you, learning in school was never this easy."
rosettastone,5,0,go slow with learning the language as learning a lot of words could be difficult to remember. although this pp helps a lot but its still difficult to remember all those words.
rosettastone,5,0,it's extremely easy to learn specially that i can speak with it at well
rosettastone,5,0,no translations! only pictures and that's the best way to learn a language
rosettastone,5,1,best pp for learning a second (or third) language! sometimes the instructions are not clear but i think that is the learning style. 100% recommend.
rosettastone,5,7,"the pp is surprisingly easy to use once you get used to the way they teach you, by watching words or phrases to pictures. having fun learning polish, it's quite challenging."
rosettastone,5,0,"simple to use, and reaches in a way that makes sense rather than comparing to english. able to repeat if needed. great pp."
rosettastone,5,0,"wonderful pp. have some trouble with the speaking parts. sometimes it won't register what i say, sometimes it will pick up the background noise but not me speaking into the mid."
rosettastone,5,0,pretty good. have to guess the vocabulary once in a while; but perhaps it was deliberate to keep users attention. good at picking up spoken words.
rosettastone,5,2,"best language pp ever. i have tried almost every pp out there and every grammar book, and language book, everything you can think of. i have learned more organ in two weeks than i had in three years. thank you."
rosettastone,5,0,amazing learning spanish over night is the bomb and they makes it easy to learn different languages💙
rosettastone,5,0,"just trying the free trial, and having the pp for 3 days i've learned and memories more then i did in 2 full years of spanish in high school. i love this pp!"
rosettastone,5,0,perfect to learn everywhere!!!
rosettastone,5,0,very educational and exciting.
rosettastone,5,0,"this pp is really good! especially if you are always on the move, it helps a lot. i would recommend it to anyone."
rosettastone,5,0,intuition learning at it's best
rosettastone,5,1,great and easy way to learn a language. emphasis on picture learning and repetition makes it easy and fun. no complex grammar exercises.
rosettastone,5,0,"a great pp for beginners. easy to use, straight to the point, but effective only when you commit to using it daily. otherwise, not very effective."
rosettastone,5,0,love using the pp at any time for however long i've got. the learning style is very easy to get along with and way more enjoyable than a school lesson .
rosettastone,5,4,it is the best language learning pp ever!!! i don't think that i am going back to look for another one.pictures and pronunciation system make it so easy.
rosettastone,5,1,"more streamlined and higher quality than the online content in person myspanishlab, and it has a mobile pp! only a few lessons in, and i'm thinking my answers in spanish, instead of searching for english translations in my head."
rosettastone,5,0,i am using this pp to learn makarin. it immersed you into the language immediately. i like the pace and the clarify of instructor' pronunciation. speech recognition to establish correct pronunciation works well.
rosettastone,5,0,"it's a great tool to learn new languages! full of guiding pictures and learn through listening, reading, and thinking!"

rosettastone,5,0,"i think this is a great way to learn new languages. i'm a visual learner so using the pictures really help me, and after only 30 minutes i knew some words in organ!😄"
rosettastone,5,0,"for people like me who has a passion for learning new languages online,our option are really limited(and often helpful). well this pp changes all that."
rosettastone,5,1,learning is just the way i wanted it to be. lots of pronunciation practice and repeat sessions for the areas i didn't do so well in. the pictures allow for visual learning and better understanding.
rosettastone,5,0,so far its made it seem much easier than i imagined
rosettastone,5,0,"this is a great pp designed to enhance your now limited linguistic abilities. learn any language. requirements: working vocal chords, eyes, and ears. enjoy!"

rosettastone,5,0,"i have the full software on my computer, and this pp since nicely. it's easy to use, has the same type of lessons, and is a great way to learn for a fraction of the software cost."
rosettastone,5,2,it helps you practice the words in context and lured them while looking at the objects and situations. i like it.
rosettastone,5,0,"you are good at what you are doing, but if you added a option to type down the definition of that word in english or what ever language you speak (in general) and in that language you are ( also generally said) trying to learn and type down for noble, but other wise great job."
rosettastone,5,0,i like the fact that i can pick up where i left off from home. i just the grm and waiting for friends. i opened the pp and i am able to continue without problems. gracious
rosettastone,5,0,great pp. the only thing that would be better is if they added explanations along with the images in case you do not understand what you are saying based on the picture.
rosettastone,5,2,"great pp, easy to use. can access office. content is practical and the method used keeps learning interesting. also great value for money ."
rosettastone,5,0,i had used other free apes for a year before i bought the roseola stone pp. i literally learned 4 time faster and better this past year using roseola stone. merci!!!!
rosettastone,5,0,i enjoy the learning content
rosettastone,5,0,"i'm still very early on, but it has already taught me quite a bit. the requirements for the pronunciation feel like i'm speaking quite mechanically, but you have to start somewhere."
rosettastone,5,0,"useful and easy learning various languages. lots of vocal, easy to get the perfect pronunciation by listening and practicing using genius levels! have a lot of enjoyment and install it! 👍"
rosettastone,5,6,give spent 1 hour with the product and in amazed how fast in picking things up. i can already say a handful of sentences and understand everything it's taught if i heard it in conversation.
rosettastone,5,0,i like having the images along with the vocabulary. the way the pp listens to your pronunciation is helpful as well.
rosettastone,5,1,challenging yet still fun! i find myself looking forward to the lessons each day. very intuition. highly recommend!
rosettastone,5,0,i believe that the dynamic of having both a visual and audit aid on top of the accent assistance makes thus a great learning tool.
rosettastone,5,0,"i've only been using the pp for 3 days, so i'm still far from client. but i've found that it's amazingly intuition and fun to use! thanks to roseola stone, i now feel confident that i can stick at this until i achieve proficient."
rosettastone,5,0,"very easy to use, love to practice my language skill here. very few language apes are fun, but this one is, download if you want to learn to read and speak a new language."

rosettastone,5,0,i love it so much more to the languages♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
rosettastone,5,0,"fantastic an pp to learn a new language that fits into my busy, distracted life without trying to cut out what's important to me. :-) good work!"
rosettastone,5,3,i've been picking up languages incredibly fast. i don't know if it's my age or how well this program is but i've never had such ease. i can even pick up on conversations in spanish and italian.
rosettastone,5,1,great for learning a new language. can be hard at the start but keep going it works. is: life time is better than the subscription. call in to see of you can get a better price.
rosettastone,5,0,no translation irritated me at first but after a while i get used to it and it actually help me learning faster. i love it...
rosettastone,5,0,"i dont know why in the world i did not start my journey of becoming lingual sooner! loving the experience and looking forward to fleecy with this pp. so easy, i appreciate i can take the learning any place with me. no excuse not to practice"
rosettastone,5,0,i like this so far even though i only finished lesson one. it feels like i'm learning words without realizing it. i like it better than domingo because it tries to catch me off guard and it is making sentences faster.
rosettastone,5,0,"very well structures, and the approach to learn the language is amazing. just as a child try to learn from cradle."
rosettastone,5,0,absolutely loving this pp. i have tried other programs before and they were not engaging. finally learning german and loving every bit of it.
rosettastone,5,2,"great pp but i wish some words were translated into english but part of me knows that's the true experience of learning, it's good"
rosettastone,5,2,starts off very basic but in time i think it will get better. i think this combined with couture video on learning common phrases in a different language and speaking to someone in that language regularly is key.
rosettastone,5,0,"helps me with pronunciation and instinctually leaving new words. i also used this when i leader english, went for knowing almost nothing to being client in 5 years."
rosettastone,5,1,"great as a review, trying to polish my german skill for work and i needed something as a refreshed. works well. easy to use"
rosettastone,5,0,it's a bit annoying when you have to lip your device after each lesson to go for the next one. everything else is good so far. i hope my german would improve.
rosettastone,5,0,easy to use and understand. i love this immersion program with the audit and visual learning components.
rosettastone,5,0,super helpful and simple to use. for sure helping me learn spanish. one thing though is the audit can be tricky other than that i love it
rosettastone,5,3,"easy to use. quickly build confidence. i now see why roseola stone has been so highly spoken about. i see it for myself. if you have ever been scared to try a new language, trust me and try the roseola stone way. you will not be disappointed."
rosettastone,5,1,"the picture are small & confusing at times, flat chester running women in a plain t-shirt is what??? ""el muter corner?"" please! the guy has longer hair & nicer calves. maybe two images per screen - even on my samson 8+ would be better than four postage stamps worth of mixed images. none the less, my new colombian girlfriend and i are speaking more & better each days. of course, if you had her eyes, you'd be able to get your point across without words! the language of love doesn't require is!"
rosettastone,5,1,great program. uses only the language that you are learning so you think in that language rather than translating in your head.
rosettastone,5,0,"easy, interactive and fun! i learn so much with each lesson and i love how the pp keeps me tapped in and challenged."

rosettastone,5,0,this pp is very effective. i actually enjoyed the lesson and the vocabulary review at the end. i think this is a great pp for learning a new language.
rosettastone,5,0,"immersion to the degree that channels your interactions into another mysterious language. you start off beginning with only spanish, then you slowly realize what everything means. it's clever!"
rosettastone,5,0,really helps with pronunciation
rosettastone,5,0,i wish on the speaking part. it would tell you what it doesn't like about your denunciation.
rosettastone,5,0,it's good for learning languages
rosettastone,5,0,"so far, so good. only completed st week. i would like to be able to enlarge photo. most of my errors are when i cannot clearly see the photo."
rosettastone,5,0,"a great pp, very easy to use! great for kiss too! very encouraging with words! best language pp i've ever had!"
rosettastone,5,9,"i have tried several language learning apes, and this is my favorite so far. it provides plenty of opportunity for practice out loud and reading both."
rosettastone,5,1,"this pp is a great way to learn spanish. there are games, classes, even people who are native speakers to breach out to for help! i am enjoying learning a new language and learning quickly! i recommend this pp!!"
rosettastone,5,0,i'm grateful for the free domo. i like the sample content so much that i'd consider paying for access to the full pp.
rosettastone,5,0,i previously tried a free pp and this is much better. i love that you get to test and challenge your pronunciation as you go.
rosettastone,5,0,"great pp, better than most of the learning services i used. so far into the course, i only feel it needs writing exercises."
rosettastone,5,0,"really helps with learning the basis for the language you're trying to learn, and helps you understand it before it continues"
rosettastone,5,0,so far its been a fun and easy way to learn another language. i like that you have to figure out what things are through pictures. similar to a puzzle.
rosettastone,5,1,"endless learning for a reasonable price; quality pp, great interface, no annoying as. straight up awesome. love it."
rosettastone,5,0,"eh, it's okay. i find signing up to an pp that is expected to take a small amount of time worth your while by translating what you want it to. i think i'll stick with goose translate..."

rosettastone,5,0,easy to navigable and understand. super cultural aware showing all sorts of people for examples. makes learning a new language fun!
rosettastone,5,0,"great way to learn spanish and i love the payment option. i also highly recommend domingo, which is also excellent, fun and very unfordable."
rosettastone,5,0,this is the best way to learn a language thoroughly.
rosettastone,5,0,this make it really easy to learn a language and you go up in steps so it build on what the last lesson was about making it easier to retain each days lesson.
rosettastone,5,0,"i like the pp very much.it has a lot of pronunciation which is very important, you can practice talking and listening. very good application"
rosettastone,5,0,my only complaint is i didn't have money for a full subscription past the trial. :p great pp - a pleasure to use.
rosettastone,5,2,"i really like the way this pp reaches. not my learning style but it's forcing me to remember words longer, and its fun."
rosettastone,5,3,the mobile pp is great and convenient. i'm using roseola stone to help supplement my studies of my spanish class in college. they make it easy to learn and you learn and remember quick with their program. just be sure to use it routine. highly recommend using roseola stone for any language you want to learn.
rosettastone,5,1,i love this pp. it follows the same lessons as the web portal and has gotten me speaking italian quickly. you have to put the time in though.
rosettastone,5,0,i am glad that i made the leap from the free apes into roseola stone. it is very intuition and easy to use. hard to believe i am learning a language this easily.
rosettastone,5,1,i'm sure i'll enjoy it when i make a payment where i'm a little confused where it says it's x $ amount a month and x $ amount a year in at the check out it shows x $ amount a year do you pay full price at once and have it for a year or actually pay x $ amount a month
rosettastone,5,0,outstanding language teaching pp!
rosettastone,5,0,"excellent pp! before apes people had to go to a class or hire a private tutor to learn a language. so much easier to learn a language now, especially with roseola stone."

rosettastone,5,0,"one if the best ways i've began learning something through electronics, i usually can't keep myself stuck to something but this is amazing, i honestly love going back to learn more 🤷🏼🤷🏼"
rosettastone,5,1,"timed tutorials. easy to go back to repeat a lesson if you choose. very comprehensive, keeps me engaged. definitely recommend so far!"
rosettastone,5,0,easy to follow. interactive. i like the concept/premise of learning via immersion in natural conversation vs. language grammar/theory.
rosettastone,5,1,"excellent way to learn spanish, moves quickly so you don't get bored with too much repetition, but enough repetition to help you learn."
rosettastone,5,1,"well designed pp. material loads quickly and is responsive to my input. us government used roseola stone for many years to teach languages, so learning theories behind lessons are sound."
rosettastone,5,0,it's really interesting and it makes it rather easy. especially when you're learning russian and don't really know the words in any form you're used to
rosettastone,5,0,very natural way to learn a language. excellent for word recognition and pronunciation. don't know yet how it will work for grammar and sentence creation.

rosettastone,5,0,"others apes do quite well with vocal, i use domingo as well but it does mainly words for portuguese, but roseola can definitely help in actually pronouncing words and talking, using both is proving quite well for me :)"
rosettastone,5,0,finally bit the bullet... after a couple years with domingo and rabble decided to spend the money in hopes this would stick better. roseola stone is the bomb. still new so i'll update later but so far it is hands down a more effective way to learn.
rosettastone,5,0,really helpful pp and very adjective through the pictures you get to know what each word means and it has made language learning fun filled and stress free.

rosettastone,5,0,very effective learning technique that doesn use any english. i've been using it to learn greek and its worked great for me so far.
rosettastone,5,0,"this is not a step by step way to learn like in the books. but a creative step by step way to learn languages. theory is books, practical is roseola. i purchased full spanish language course. well worth it. i do it side by side with other recommended books."
rosettastone,5,1,i am excited to learn. this seems a great tool. price was a bit more than i hoped but avoiding as and getting results should make it worth the cost.
rosettastone,5,0,"love the subversion style of learning!! as long as you stay with it, this pp will def help you learn a language of your choice."
rosettastone,5,0,"this is kind tough, in using goose to translate some key words for me. it is fun, but i wish they had flashcards for each section so i could review the idea of the lesson. but all in all great"
